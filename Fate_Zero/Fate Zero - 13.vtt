1
00:22.178 --> 00:24.052
Ah, Okeanos.

2
00:42.090 --> 00:45.236
I have to ask, what brought on this sudden outing?

3
00:45.590 --> 00:47.176
Why are we going into town?

4
00:47.729 --> 00:50.246
No reason, change of scenery, that's all.

5
00:50.906 --> 00:55.091
You've been whining all the time about wanting
to see the amusement district, haven't you?

6
00:56.731 --> 00:59.135
The joy of window‐shopping in
a foreign land is every bit

7
00:59.508 --> 01:02.285
as wonderful as the thrilling joy of battle.

8
01:02.698 --> 01:07.708
I feel really bad for the countries that got
themselves invaded for a stupid reason like that.

9
01:07.988 --> 01:09.098
What is it, boy?

10
01:09.443 --> 01:11.978
You sound like you actually
saw something like that happen.

11
01:13.185 --> 01:14.105
Never mind.

12
01:14.226 --> 01:15.768
I was just thinking out loud.

13
02:56.728 --> 02:57.790
No way.

14
02:58.796 --> 03:00.573
This is horrible.

15
03:01.960 --> 03:04.853
We worked so hard to create this artwork!

16
03:05.966 --> 03:07.192
How could they?

17
03:08.472 --> 03:12.997
What kind of... What kind of inhuman
monster would so something like this?!

18
03:17.827 --> 03:19.320
Dear Ryuunosuke,

19
03:19.345 --> 03:25.518
only a very select few can fully comprehend the
immense importance of true beauty and harmony.

20
03:26.045 --> 03:29.126
To the vast majority of common ignorant philistines,

21
03:29.439 --> 03:32.911
beauty is but something to be
loathed and feared and destroyed.

22
03:33.960 --> 03:38.874
It is for that very reason that we mustn't
become excessively attached to our creations.

23
03:39.494 --> 03:43.858
All things given form and substance are
destined to one day break and fade away.

24
03:44.268 --> 03:50.487
It is therefore absolutely essential that we find joy in
the process of creation instead of the creation itself.

25
03:50.913 --> 03:53.617
So, whatever they break, we should just make another?

26
03:53.896 --> 03:54.446
Is that it?

27
03:54.585 --> 03:56.147
Precisely so!

28
03:56.367 --> 04:02.250
As always, my dear Ryuunosuke, your understanding
of important matters is your best virtue.

29
04:08.228 --> 04:12.835
Maybe we were just having way too much fun and so God

30
04:13.366 --> 04:15.087
decided to punish us?

31
04:16.338 --> 04:19.682
Listen carefully to what I say to you now, Ryuunosuke!

32
04:20.582 --> 04:22.743
God does not punish humans ever!

33
04:22.843 --> 04:25.025
He simply toys with them, cruelly.

34
04:25.352 --> 04:26.672
B... big guy?

35
04:26.922 --> 04:33.594
Once, long ago, I committed spectacular atrocities
the likes of which this Earth had never imagined.

36
04:34.220 --> 04:39.494
Day after day, I murdered and defiled,
yet no divine punishment rained down on me.

37
04:40.234 --> 04:46.334
Before I knew it, eight years had passed and my
exploration into the depths of evil had been ignored.

38
04:46.761 --> 04:47.927
In the end,

39
04:47.952 --> 04:51.192
it was not God that destroyed
me and took away my life,

40
04:51.338 --> 04:54.413
but rather the selfishness of my fellow Man.

41
04:54.841 --> 04:58.919
The church and the state executed me,
not for anything wrong that I had done,

42
04:59.205 --> 05:04.200
but because they coveted my wealth and my land and
wanted to take them from me and make them their own!

43
05:04.680 --> 05:08.001
What brought an end to my evil
deeds was far from judgment;

44
05:08.067 --> 05:10.689
it was simple theft by a pack of criminals!

45
05:11.069 --> 05:14.542
Uh, yeah, but, big guy.

46
05:15.667 --> 05:18.814
There's... there's still a God, right?

47
05:21.477 --> 05:26.733
Why ever would you think that? You, who are without
faith and have never in your life known a miracle.

48
05:27.134 --> 05:29.793
Because the world seems like it's so boring.

49
05:30.353 --> 05:34.911
But then, the more you look, the more you find
all kinds of neat and crazy stuff around you!

50
05:35.431 --> 05:36.953
I've always thought that way.

51
05:37.462 --> 05:42.840
A world filled with so many wondrous and amazing things
like this could never have happened simply by chance.

52
05:43.384 --> 05:48.716
If you set your mind to enjoying it, there's no
better entertainment than this unbelievable world!

53
05:49.567 --> 05:55.119
I'm sure there's a master entertainer somewhere writing
the story of all five billion people in this world.

54
05:55.642 --> 06:01.975
If you wanted to describe somebody like that, what
other name could you possibly call Him but God Himself?

55
06:02.461 --> 06:08.113
Then, Ryuunosuke, do you believe that
it's possible God loves humanity?

56
06:08.242 --> 06:10.530
What do you mean?
He's head over heels.

57
06:10.776 --> 06:14.951
I mean, if He's spending every minute
of every day writing our story,

58
06:15.094 --> 06:17.693
well,
He could never do it if He didn't love us.

59
06:18.421 --> 06:21.111
In fact, I'll bet you He's totally into it,

60
06:21.545 --> 06:24.650
along with totally enjoying the results of His own work.

61
06:25.498 --> 06:29.863
He also loves all the things that make humans look
good, like honor, courage, and hope,

62
06:29.963 --> 06:33.341
and at the very same time, He loves screams and blood

63
06:33.461 --> 06:35.253
and utter despair just as much.

64
06:35.646 --> 06:40.554
If He didn't, there's just no way in Hell the guts of
living things would be as cool and colorful as they are.

65
06:40.801 --> 06:45.353
So, I'm positive the whole world is filled
to the brim with God's love, big guy.

66
06:45.897 --> 06:51.660
In this era of faithlessness when the state
has completely abandoned the true will of God,

67
06:52.468 --> 06:57.903
I had no idea that such a vivacious new faith had
taken root and was beginning to bear amazing fruit.

68
06:58.383 --> 07:02.839
You have my admiration, Ryuunosuke, my dear master.

69
07:03.756 --> 07:06.151
Cut it out, I'm starting to blush.

70
07:06.448 --> 07:12.543
But wait, according to your bold view of religion,
were not my blasphemies nothing more than a silly farce?

71
07:12.710 --> 07:13.501
Not at all.

72
07:13.786 --> 07:15.199
You know, the best entertainers

73
07:15.299 --> 07:19.698
will sometimes get the most acclaim of their careers
when they play a really dark and disturbed villain.

74
07:20.416 --> 07:22.398
I think when you get right down to it,

75
07:22.611 --> 07:26.243
God probably loves playing against your
cruel and demented villain routine.

76
07:31.232 --> 07:34.074
So both blasphemy and worship

77
07:34.671 --> 07:38.557
are, in your eyes,
actually valid forms of Godly devotion?

78
07:39.485 --> 07:41.789
Oh, that's marvelous!

79
07:41.814 --> 07:46.433
Truly, you are the insightful bearer of
a brilliant and important new philosophy!

80
07:46.828 --> 07:50.027
A God who makes me a puppet of man for His own sport,

81
07:50.140 --> 07:53.597
and, at the same time, is Himself but another clown!

82
07:53.904 --> 07:58.336
I see; His vicious ways finally make sense to me now!

83
07:59.078 --> 08:00.299
Very well, then.

84
08:00.552 --> 08:04.478
Let us go and paint the gardens
of the puppet master God

85
08:04.503 --> 08:08.205
with even more brilliant despair
and terror and depravity.

86
08:09.459 --> 08:16.003
We will show the author of this wicked world who
hides up in Heaven that God is not the only one here

87
08:16.030 --> 08:17.682
who knows what entertainment is.

88
08:17.849 --> 08:21.317
We're gonna do something awesome
again, aren't we, big guy?

89
08:22.729 --> 08:24.936
Cool, cool!

90
08:29.060 --> 08:30.110
All right, now.

91
08:30.203 --> 08:31.963
I'll be in this bookstore for a while.

92
08:33.635 --> 08:35.850
As for you, you can go do whatever you want,

93
08:36.090 --> 08:38.425
but you're not to set foot outside this arcade.

94
08:39.291 --> 08:43.588
If I'm attacked and kicked while I'm here,
it's curtains for you, too, understand?

95
08:45.028 --> 08:45.854
Of course.

96
08:46.162 --> 08:49.402
No conquering, Rider, means no plundering either.

97
08:49.858 --> 08:50.435
Huh?

98
08:51.068 --> 08:51.690
Huh?

99
08:52.028 --> 08:54.618
Pay attention to me, dammit!

100
08:57.177 --> 09:00.039
There's to be no shoplifting
and no eating without paying!

101
09:00.374 --> 09:03.095
If you want something, then pay for it with this money,

102
09:03.609 --> 09:06.839
or am I gonna have to use a Command
Seal in order to make you behave?

103
09:09.425 --> 09:11.085
Now, don't be rude.

104
09:11.506 --> 09:16.950
Back in my day, Macedonian etiquette was the
mark of a man of culture in palaces everywhere.

105
09:17.638 --> 09:18.350
I'm off.

106
09:18.715 --> 09:19.638
Until later.

107
09:44.812 --> 09:47.780
"The king gave control over
the lands he had conquered

108
09:47.805 --> 09:51.273
and the rights to the taxes from
those lands to the local nobles.

109
09:51.703 --> 09:55.373
He then mustered his armies and marched
off, taking them further east."

110
09:56.178 --> 09:57.828
Just like in my dream.

111
09:59.017 --> 10:00.888
"He continued on his campaign...

112
10:04.599 --> 10:06.979
...because he wanted to reach Okeanos,

113
10:07.166 --> 10:08.661
the furthest ocean."

114
10:14.952 --> 10:16.992
Hey, boy, where are you?

115
10:20.933 --> 10:22.708
Ah, yes, here you are.

116
10:22.983 --> 10:27.071
You know, you're so tiny,
you're impossible to see between these bookshelves.

117
10:27.628 --> 10:29.350
It was difficult to find you.

118
10:29.668 --> 10:32.556
Normal people are smaller than bookshelves, idiot.

119
10:32.718 --> 10:33.369
Man!

120
10:33.811 --> 10:36.111
So, what is it you bought?

121
10:36.178 --> 10:37.313
Feast your eyes!

122
10:37.646 --> 10:42.082
It just so happens that the new Admirable
Grand Strategy videogame came out today.

123
10:42.388 --> 10:44.053
First‐run, limited edition!

124
10:45.848 --> 10:48.927
I suppose my luck must be pretty good today.

125
10:49.320 --> 10:52.898
You know, there's no point is buying software

126
10:53.115 --> 10:55.118
when you don't even have a game console.

127
10:55.408 --> 10:57.351
Yes, I took care of that.

128
10:58.606 --> 11:01.750
Come on, boy, let's go play in two player mode!

129
11:01.948 --> 11:03.543
I bought us each a controller.

130
11:04.349 --> 11:07.979
I'm not interested in low‐class entertainment like that.

131
11:08.168 --> 11:09.163
It's stupid.

132
11:10.111 --> 11:11.226
What's wrong with you?

133
11:11.724 --> 11:14.871
Why are you constantly trying to
narrow your own horizons instead of

134
11:14.896 --> 11:16.798
broadening them
to the fullest you can?

135
11:17.127 --> 11:20.204
Don't you ever get the desire to seek out something fun?

136
11:20.638 --> 11:21.624
Shut up.

137
11:22.119 --> 11:24.229
If I had spare time to waste on that,

138
11:24.436 --> 11:26.191
I'd spend it all on a search for truth rather than... 

139
11:26.268 --> 11:30.256
So, what was it you found so
interesting on this shelf over here?

140
11:30.920 --> 11:32.324
Was it this one?

141
11:34.373 --> 11:37.754
Well, I'll be, this is a book about me!

142
11:38.368 --> 11:40.211
You are a strange boy,

143
11:41.198 --> 11:43.646
I am right here in front of you every day.

144
11:43.908 --> 11:46.058
If you wanna know something, just ask me.

145
11:47.328 --> 11:50.504
All right, fine then, I'll ask you!

146
11:52.290 --> 11:54.497
According to the description of this history book,

147
11:54.637 --> 11:56.928
you were really short back when you were first alive.

148
11:57.181 --> 12:00.759
So, how come you materialized
here in such an enormous body?

149
12:01.410 --> 12:04.565
Huh, it says that I was tiny?

150
12:05.742 --> 12:09.655
I've always believed that you should never
completely trust what's written in a book

151
12:09.709 --> 12:11.382
when you don't know the person who wrote it.

152
12:14.478 --> 12:18.044
Wait a minute, you mean to tell me
you're not mad they got it all wrong?

153
12:18.383 --> 12:21.291
Huh, no, it doesn't really bother me.

154
12:22.118 --> 12:23.207
That's strange.

155
12:23.573 --> 12:26.247
Throughout history, the people in charge

156
12:26.346 --> 12:30.338
have always tried their hardest to make
sure future generations remember them.

157
12:31.295 --> 12:37.072
I suppose having your name recorded in the
history books is a kind of noble immortality.

158
12:38.393 --> 12:42.663
But if that means my name and nothing
else gets passed down for two millennia,

159
12:42.872 --> 12:48.568
I would have preferred to have...even
a hundredth of that added to my life.

160
12:49.638 --> 12:53.709
So, then...it's true that
you died in your early 30s?

161
12:54.087 --> 12:56.421
Hmm, yes, that one's true.

162
12:57.818 --> 12:58.450
Oh.

163
13:02.488 --> 13:04.478
Hey, big guy!

164
13:06.685 --> 13:12.744
Get going out there and show us some cool
gig that's gonna shock even God, okay?!

165
13:13.308 --> 13:16.359
You may look forward to it, Ryuunosuke!

166
13:16.525 --> 13:20.018
It will be the greatest "cool!"
you have ever seen in your life!

167
13:20.428 --> 13:21.548
Seriously?

168
13:21.797 --> 13:25.172
All right, I can't wait to see it!

169
13:25.718 --> 13:26.867
Uh.

170
13:37.910 --> 13:41.687
Oh, yeah, something really awesome
is gonna happen here, I just know it!

171
13:54.931 --> 13:57.351
Hey, why are you being so quiet, boy?

172
13:57.418 --> 13:58.158
Hmm?

173
14:00.258 --> 14:04.424
It's nothing, I was just thinking
about how boring you are.

174
14:04.928 --> 14:06.144
What, you were?

175
14:06.452 --> 14:08.928
See, you are bored, just as I thought.

176
14:09.181 --> 14:11.445
Just quit whining and play this game with me.

177
14:11.688 --> 14:12.755
That's not it!

178
14:13.672 --> 14:17.936
You see, with a servant like you
who's practically guaranteed to win,

179
14:19.764 --> 14:21.922
I couldn't take pride in winning the grail.

180
14:22.601 --> 14:27.698
It would have been a lot better for both of us
if my pact had been with Assassin instead of you!

181
14:28.066 --> 14:31.461
Mmm, I don't think that would
have worked out for you at all.

182
14:31.908 --> 14:34.538
I think by now, you'd be deceased.

183
14:34.618 --> 14:35.809
Well, that's fine!

184
14:36.144 --> 14:39.394
If I'm going to die fighting in my own
battle, I'm not going to complain!

185
14:39.792 --> 14:42.840
That's the reason why I decided to join the Grail War,

186
14:43.564 --> 14:44.229
and now...

187
14:44.758 --> 14:47.294
I really don't know what to tell you, boy.

188
14:47.915 --> 14:52.812
If the wish you have for the Holy Grail was
something that impressed me in some form or manner,

189
14:53.299 --> 14:58.337
I would be far more inclined to enthusiastically
obey your every whim and desire.

190
14:59.872 --> 15:04.069
But if all you want it for is to add a few
centimeters to your diminutive stature... 

191
15:04.344 --> 15:06.479
You have no idea what you're talking about!

192
15:06.766 --> 15:08.703
You don't need to be in such a hurry.

193
15:09.251 --> 15:14.011
Nobody said that the Holy Grail War would be the
single most important event of your entire life.

194
15:14.104 --> 15:15.310
There will be others.

195
15:15.644 --> 15:16.104
What?

196
15:17.668 --> 15:22.319
When the day finally arrives that you find a
way to live that you can truly be proud of,

197
15:22.653 --> 15:24.919
you'll be forced into your own grand battle,

198
15:25.159 --> 15:27.696
one that you will have to fight
whether you want to or not.

199
15:29.153 --> 15:31.104
You will have plenty of time, then,

200
15:31.632 --> 15:33.085
to look for your battlefield.

201
15:33.658 --> 15:35.980
I'm saying that I'm not the only one here

202
15:36.453 --> 15:38.504
who isn't satisfied with this pact.

203
15:38.832 --> 15:39.439
Mmm?

204
15:39.859 --> 15:42.122
You don't like it any more than I do, right?

205
15:42.529 --> 15:45.013
Having me as your sworn master, I mean.

206
15:45.353 --> 15:47.633
You'd have been able
to win this war easier

207
15:47.658 --> 15:50.735
if only you'd sworn your allegiance
to a different master, right?

208
15:52.578 --> 15:54.026
Probably, yes.

209
16:05.806 --> 16:07.126
Take a look, boy.

210
16:07.239 --> 16:10.391
You see, you're looking at the
real enemy that I'm facing.

211
16:11.447 --> 16:15.980
Now, try to draw a picture of the two
of us standing alongside this enemy.

212
16:17.049 --> 16:20.146
Draw it so you can tell the difference in our sizes.

213
16:20.381 --> 16:23.262
Wait, what do you mean,
that's...  Impossible, right?

214
16:23.516 --> 16:25.993
Compared to the enemy that we're about to take on,

215
16:26.286 --> 16:29.503
you and I are the same, just little dots.

216
16:29.850 --> 16:32.538
What point is there in trying to compare our sizes?

217
16:34.352 --> 16:36.661
That is exactly why I'm excited!

218
16:37.121 --> 16:40.187
The weakest and the smallest; that's just perfect!

219
16:40.666 --> 16:42.841
With a body tinier than a poppy seed,

220
16:43.188 --> 16:46.605
I will someday overtake and
even surpass the entire world!

221
16:46.925 --> 16:48.835
Nothing can ever stop my quest,

222
16:49.075 --> 16:52.947
for in my chest beats the invincible
heart of the King of Conquerors!

223
16:53.849 --> 16:58.119
So, what you're saying is who your
master is makes no difference.

224
16:59.018 --> 17:04.518
No matter how weak I am, it really doesn't
matter one way or the other to you?

225
17:04.715 --> 17:07.227
Now, where did you get that stupid idea?

226
17:09.262 --> 17:14.858
That miserable complaining nature of yours is a
sign that somewhere inside you is a conqueror.

227
17:15.118 --> 17:17.191
No matter what you want me to believe,

228
17:17.598 --> 17:20.328
you are acutely aware of how small you are

229
17:20.945 --> 17:22.469
and yet, in spite of that,

230
17:22.813 --> 17:26.666
you still struggle to reach heights greater
than you could ever begin to imagine.

231
17:27.328 --> 17:30.060
It's not a compliment; you're making fun of me.

232
17:30.687 --> 17:31.653
Indeed, boy.

233
17:31.973 --> 17:35.419
Face it, you are a stubborn and incorrigible idiot.

234
17:36.798 --> 17:39.893
Your deepest desires are far greater than yourself.

235
17:40.293 --> 17:42.857
Like they say, glory lies beyond the horizon.

236
17:43.490 --> 17:47.438
Back in the world that I lived in,
that was the fundamental rule of a full life.

237
17:47.831 --> 17:51.676
Is that why you kept rushing towards the
east all the time like some kind of idiot?

238
17:52.056 --> 17:53.691
Of course, that's right!

239
17:54.117 --> 18:00.520
I wanted to see Okeanos with my own eyes, but,
alas, my glorious dream was never realized.

240
18:00.727 --> 18:01.334
Huh?

241
18:02.368 --> 18:04.764
You never saw the ocean like in my dream?

242
18:06.159 --> 18:10.689
Even now, boy,
Okeanos remains the place I strive for.

243
18:11.424 --> 18:13.470
It is a never‐ending dream.

244
18:13.903 --> 18:19.653
That sea in my dream was really an image
of the heart that Rider has been dreaming.

245
18:20.141 --> 18:20.988
Laugh if you like.

246
18:21.550 --> 18:27.615
I, who after 2,000 years still dream the same dream
about a place he's never seen, am a great fool.

247
18:28.718 --> 18:32.549
So, you see, boy, a pact with an idiot like you

248
18:32.929 --> 18:34.810
is just perfect for me.

249
18:41.448 --> 18:43.330
The river, I feel it.

250
18:46.562 --> 18:48.279
Can you see what is happening?

251
18:48.439 --> 18:50.485
Could it be him, Lancer?

252
18:51.345 --> 18:53.069
It is Caster, indeed.

253
18:53.436 --> 18:56.117
He is positioned on the river and is doing something;

254
18:56.824 --> 18:59.070
however, I cannot make out what exactly.

255
18:59.578 --> 19:02.733
It's the perfect chance to attack and put him down.

256
19:03.018 --> 19:03.880
Agreed.

257
19:07.225 --> 19:12.415
If I can defeat Caster, I can regain one
of the bonds with Lancer that I lost.

258
19:13.548 --> 19:17.180
I will go and engage him, you stay here, Madam Sola‐Ui,

259
19:17.777 --> 19:20.024
and bear witness to the deeds I perform.

260
19:20.184 --> 19:21.290
What do you mean?

261
19:21.510 --> 19:23.845
But I have to go, I'm a master now!

262
19:24.032 --> 19:25.328
I'll be by your side.

263
19:25.446 --> 19:26.748
You mustn't, Madam.

264
19:26.991 --> 19:30.684
You do not understand military
matters as Master Kayneth does.

265
19:31.557 --> 19:33.826
That river will become a deathtrap.

266
19:34.406 --> 19:35.649
Please understand.

267
19:36.678 --> 19:37.733
But, I... 

268
19:38.273 --> 19:44.173
Unless, perhaps, you still harbor doubts as to
where the true loyalty of Diarmuid actually lies,

269
19:44.460 --> 19:46.833
that he would fight to serve his own ends?

270
19:50.256 --> 19:54.088
Lancer, go fight as you will,
I leave field decisions to you.

271
19:54.628 --> 19:57.632
Fight the battle freely and without any regret.

272
19:58.025 --> 19:59.136
I am in your debt.

273
20:06.613 --> 20:08.360
If you return victorious,

274
20:09.113 --> 20:12.941
I hope you'll grant me a smile, Lancer.

275
20:30.810 --> 20:32.737
Caster.

276
20:33.172 --> 20:36.517
This incredible outpouring of
mana from him leaves me no doubts.

277
20:36.776 --> 20:40.558
Caster is in the process of
casting some incredible magic.

278
20:40.810 --> 20:41.565
Hmm?

279
20:46.888 --> 20:49.369
Greetings and welcome, Holy Virgin!

280
20:49.616 --> 20:53.615
I am incredibly overjoyed that
we find ourselves together again.

281
20:53.997 --> 20:56.181
You just never
learn, you monster!

282
20:56.254 --> 20:58.161
What is it you're trying to do here?

283
20:58.281 --> 21:00.431
I'm terribly sorry, my dear Jeanne,

284
21:00.671 --> 21:02.921
but you're not the guest of honor this evening.

285
21:03.790 --> 21:08.122
But if you care to join us in our revelries,
it would give me the greatest pleasure

286
21:08.162 --> 21:10.895
and fulfill the deepest wishes of my tortured soul.

287
21:11.255 --> 21:16.057
At this banquet of death and decadence that
I, Gilles de Rais, have prepared!

288
21:16.255 --> 21:20.270
You are welcome to come and eat your fill and be sated!

289
21:22.720 --> 21:28.014
And now, once again,
we raise the blood‐soaked flag of salvation!

290
21:31.341 --> 21:34.372
Unbelievable, Caster is being absorbed?

291
21:34.737 --> 21:37.667
You who are abandoned gather here!

292
21:38.120 --> 21:41.201
I shall lead you, I shall rule you.

293
21:41.827 --> 21:47.970
The resentment and rage of we, the oppressed,
shall reach onto the lofty throne of God Himself.

294
21:48.423 --> 21:51.598
God in Heaven, with words of condemnation,

295
21:51.731 --> 21:54.113
I praise Your holy name!

296
21:55.041 --> 21:56.388
What in the world?

297
21:56.816 --> 21:58.863
Oh, eminent God!

298
21:59.189 --> 22:01.204
Oh, cruel God!

299
22:01.651 --> 22:05.009
We shall pull you down from your throne!

300
22:14.157 --> 22:15.487
Hail, King of Knights.

301
22:15.672 --> 22:16.947
King of Conquerors.

302
22:17.239 --> 22:18.381
Now, just wait a minute,

303
22:18.794 --> 22:20.402
we're calling a truce for the night.

304
22:21.016 --> 22:25.997
We won't be able to have any kind of meaningful fight
unless we deal with that behemoth Caster created.

305
22:26.372 --> 22:28.683
I have been going around informing everyone

306
22:29.123 --> 22:31.007
and Lancer has agreed to come.

307
22:31.388 --> 22:33.217
He should be here any minute now.

308
22:35.916 --> 22:38.571
Understood, we will fight alongside you.

309
22:39.164 --> 22:42.612
Our alliance will be short,
but let us pledge our loyalties.

310
22:42.901 --> 22:45.476
Hey, Einzbern, you guys got a plan?

311
22:45.909 --> 22:49.401
We haven't faced Caster yet and
Lancer told me you fought him already.

312
22:49.667 --> 22:50.869
What do you think we should do?

313
22:50.962 --> 22:53.548
Just defeat him as quickly as we can.

314
22:53.902 --> 22:58.907
That horrid monster is maintaining itself
in this world by using Caster's mana,

315
22:59.169 --> 23:02.905
but if it gets its own food source and
starts to become self‐sustaining...

316
23:03.412 --> 23:05.336
We must stop Caster before then!

317
23:05.622 --> 23:06.556
Yes, I follow you.

318
23:07.376 --> 23:11.892
We need to settle this before it manages
to come ashore and begins to feed itself.

319
23:12.552 --> 23:17.608
The problem is Caster's encased himself
deep inside those thick walls of flesh.

320
23:18.192 --> 23:20.047
I'm not sure what to do.

321
23:20.634 --> 23:23.471
Drag him out, that's the only way.

322
23:24.937 --> 23:27.563
If we can expose his noble phantasm,

323
23:28.003 --> 23:31.908
then my Gáe Dearg can destroy the spell with one strike.

324
23:32.208 --> 23:36.442
Lancer, do you think you can strike
Caster's noble phantasm from the shore?

325
23:37.662 --> 23:40.867
If I can just see it, it'll be child's play.

326
23:41.258 --> 23:43.749
Then Rider and I will act as the advance guard.

327
23:44.202 --> 23:46.157
Acceptable, King of Conquerors?

328
23:46.591 --> 23:47.399
That is fine.

329
23:48.132 --> 23:50.621
My chariot has no need of roads, of course.

330
23:51.168 --> 23:54.755
But, Saber, how are you going to
attack the enemy in the river?

331
23:55.241 --> 23:58.434
My body has been blessed by the Lady of the Lake.

332
23:58.861 --> 24:02.430
Water cannot stop me,
however many fathoms deep it may be.

333
24:02.557 --> 24:03.867
Oh, very impressive.

334
24:03.987 --> 24:05.520
That is quite a rare skill.

335
24:06.093 --> 24:09.244
I want for you to serve under my command even more now.

336
24:09.964 --> 24:13.491
You will pay for your words
some other time, but for now,

337
24:13.725 --> 24:17.299
we need to drag Caster out from
within that monster and destroy him.

338
24:18.407 --> 24:21.278
Indeed, then I shall take the lead!

339
24:21.904 --> 24:23.119
Let us begin!

340
24:23.277 --> 24:24.326
Yah!

341
24:30.859 --> 24:32.413
Saber, good luck.

342
24:48.771 --> 24:50.385
Let's finish this, Caster!

343
24:50.851 --> 24:51.768
Now!
