00:06.985 --> 00:08.631
Fionn mac Cumhaill,

2
00:08.829 --> 00:12.004
hero of Ireland and leader of the Knights of Fianna,

3
00:12.198 --> 00:13.590
and my daughter, Grainne,

4
00:13.778 --> 00:16.785
are pleased to announce their engagement!

5
00:17.269 --> 00:21.458
Everyone, this night, I want you all to celebrate!

6
00:22.628 --> 00:25.121
That striking man with the mole beneath his eye,

7
00:25.708 --> 00:26.676
what is his name?

8
00:28.378 --> 00:31.550
He is a knight of Fianna, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

9
00:33.548 --> 00:34.604
Diarmuid...

10
00:46.900 --> 00:48.116
Traitor.

11
00:48.533 --> 00:51.057
You will suffer for this, Diarmuid.

12
00:51.568 --> 00:52.643
Take me with you.

13
00:54.068 --> 00:55.576
We must run away.

14
01:08.357 --> 01:09.594
Rejoice, Grainne!

15
01:09.851 --> 01:11.949
Fionn has recognized our marriage.

16
01:19.955 --> 01:23.908
Did you believe I'd forgotten
what happened with Grainne?

17
01:29.824 --> 01:31.168
A dream?

18
03:03.202 --> 03:04.862
That dream I had...

19
03:05.372 --> 03:08.270
It was the legend of Diarumuid.

20
03:08.752 --> 03:11.827
Could those have been the memories of my servant?

21
03:16.342 --> 03:17.607
Where am I?

22
03:19.302 --> 03:21.542
I see that you're awake now.

23
03:26.262 --> 03:28.700
Sola‐Ui!

24
03:28.892 --> 03:30.702
What is a meaning of this?

25
03:30.862 --> 03:33.460
Wh... what am I doing this place?

26
03:34.732 --> 03:39.012
So I gather that you have no memory
at all of what happened to you?

27
03:40.202 --> 03:43.062
I... I was shot.

28
03:43.469 --> 03:47.872
I defended myself with the Volumen Hydragyrum, but...

29
03:49.280 --> 03:51.655
...what happened to my body?

30
03:52.088 --> 03:55.990
Your body's magic circuits have misfired somehow.

31
03:56.451 --> 03:58.480
You're lucky you didn't die instantly.

32
04:00.172 --> 04:03.881
For now, I've only been able to regenerate your organs.

33
04:07.501 --> 04:10.281
But your magic circuits were utterly destroyed.

34
04:10.542 --> 04:13.822
I'm afraid you'll never use magic again.

35
04:15.890 --> 04:17.345
But I can't...

36
04:18.532 --> 04:19.407
I can't...

37
04:21.402 --> 04:23.308
Don't cry, Kayneth.

38
04:24.992 --> 04:26.917
It's too soon to give up.

39
04:28.162 --> 04:29.612
It will be all right.

40
04:29.937 --> 04:31.465
We haven't lost yet.

41
04:32.832 --> 04:33.771
Sola‐Ui.

42
04:34.575 --> 04:38.227
If the Holy Grail is truly an
omnipotent wish‐granting device,

43
04:38.450 --> 04:43.144
then healing you completely and making you
whole again should be more than possible for it.

44
04:43.457 --> 04:44.957
We need only to win.

45
04:45.352 --> 04:49.678
If we succeed and claim the Grail,
everything will return to how it was.

46
04:50.773 --> 04:54.419
So, with that in mind, Kayneth,

47
04:54.934 --> 04:57.449
why don't you give the Command Seals to me?

48
04:58.297 --> 05:01.608
That way, I can take over as Lancer's master.

49
05:02.543 --> 05:05.025
I'll win the war and bring the Grail to you.

50
05:05.202 --> 05:05.918
No.

51
05:06.202 --> 05:07.288
I won't.

52
05:07.803 --> 05:09.696
Oh, you don't believe in me then?

53
05:10.456 --> 05:13.415
Me, who will marry into Archibald family?

54
05:14.002 --> 05:15.604
No, I just...

55
05:18.792 --> 05:22.220
Sola‐Ui, do you think...

56
05:23.361 --> 05:28.306
...Lancer would actually just abandon
me and then swear fealty to you?

57
05:28.777 --> 05:29.726
I do.

58
05:30.052 --> 05:33.250
He is a Heroic Spirit here by the Grail's invitation.

59
05:33.522 --> 05:37.062
He desires the Holy Grail just as we do,

60
05:37.459 --> 05:40.081
even if he must take on a new master.

61
05:40.760 --> 05:43.135
He will accept it for the sake of his goal.

62
05:43.232 --> 05:44.284
He won't!

63
05:44.717 --> 05:47.790
Lancer isn't the fine man you think he is!

64
05:48.305 --> 05:50.131
And why do you say that, Kayneth?

65
05:50.372 --> 05:54.281
When I asked him what he would wish
for if he had the Grail, he said to me,

66
05:54.598 --> 05:57.260
"I have no interest in the Holy Grail."

67
05:58.013 --> 06:00.897
A servant with no desire for the Grail is impossible!

68
06:01.263 --> 06:03.510
He's hiding something important from me.

69
06:03.916 --> 06:07.104
But no matter. What deep,
dark secret he's trying to keep hidden,

70
06:07.312 --> 06:11.483
as long as I bear these Command Seals,
he must obey me unconditionally.

71
06:11.602 --> 06:12.250
Kayneth?

72
06:13.600 --> 06:16.466
I won't give you the Command Seals.

73
06:19.692 --> 06:22.495
Oh, Kayneth, you still don't get it.

74
06:23.272 --> 06:24.442
Don't you see?

75
06:24.487 --> 06:27.951
We must win this war no matter what the cost.

76
06:47.824 --> 06:49.340
Listen, Kayneth.

77
06:50.059 --> 06:52.572
With my limited skills as a healer,

78
06:52.932 --> 06:57.173
it is quite impossible
to remove any Command Seals by force.

79
06:57.720 --> 07:02.692
The bearer's willing consent is the sole
way for me to take them without resistance.

80
07:02.845 --> 07:06.692
If you truly cannot accept this,
you will leave me no choice.

81
07:07.152 --> 07:09.445
I will have to amputate your right arm.

82
07:09.638 --> 07:10.771
What's your answer?

83
07:23.457 --> 07:24.360
How is she?

84
07:24.537 --> 07:26.167
She's going to be all right.

85
07:26.411 --> 07:29.857
Magical healing can put a
tremendous stress on the patient.

86
07:30.230 --> 07:33.174
I think it will take some time yet before she wakes up.

87
07:35.440 --> 07:37.288
Watch her for a while, okay?

88
07:38.174 --> 07:40.198
You're going to report to Kiritsugu now?

89
07:41.209 --> 07:41.986
Yes, Saber.

90
07:42.280 --> 07:43.966
I'm sure he's worried too.

91
07:44.450 --> 07:47.041
Irisviel, I have a request.

92
07:48.302 --> 07:50.091
I'd like you to speak to him for me.

93
07:50.851 --> 07:54.075
Tell him I feel that we must pursue Caster immediately.

94
07:55.232 --> 07:56.498
But, Saber.

95
07:57.415 --> 08:02.374
Inaction on our part will mean the
deaths of many more innocent children.

96
08:05.964 --> 08:07.990
May I come in?

97
08:14.026 --> 08:16.319
How long before Maiya's back?

98
08:16.803 --> 08:20.658
Not too long, but she has to stay
in bed for another day or two.

99
08:21.055 --> 08:22.095
I see.

100
08:23.808 --> 08:25.312
You and Saber stay here.

101
08:27.022 --> 08:28.819
I'm going to go follow Kayneth.

102
08:29.946 --> 08:32.034
No, Kiritsugu, wait a minute.

103
08:32.381 --> 08:33.647
Did Saber tell you?

104
08:33.822 --> 08:36.353
She thinks we should go after Caster right away.

105
08:37.781 --> 08:39.015
Apparently so.

106
08:40.178 --> 08:44.091
Are you angry at Saber for not interfering with Lancer?

107
08:45.770 --> 08:48.440
Iri, saving a few children,

108
08:49.013 --> 08:50.773
or even a few dozen for that matter,

109
08:51.280 --> 08:52.581
is not our goal.

110
08:53.403 --> 08:56.825
Saber probably never doubted that
Lancer would spare me that day,

111
08:57.735 --> 09:00.204
but if Lancer had betrayed her, then what?

112
09:01.483 --> 09:04.380
Our Grail War would have ended right then and there.

113
09:06.991 --> 09:09.030
There's no need to tell her where I'm going.

114
09:15.504 --> 09:18.490
Lancer, please show yourself.

115
09:23.548 --> 09:26.605
Mistress Sola‐Ui, how fares Master Kayneth?

116
09:27.868 --> 09:29.481
Not well, I'm afraid.

117
09:30.221 --> 09:32.765
But I've done everything I can for him.

118
09:35.505 --> 09:37.553
This isn't your fault, Lancer.

119
09:37.695 --> 09:39.570
Kayneth brought it upon himself.

120
09:40.155 --> 09:42.130
All it means is that the Grail War

121
09:42.325 --> 09:44.595
was far too much for him to handle.

122
09:45.191 --> 09:47.152
It's not that, I just...

123
09:48.810 --> 09:52.953
Diarmuid, don't you see?
He isn't worthy of being your master.

124
09:58.885 --> 10:00.804
Kayneth has abandoned the battle,

125
10:01.305 --> 10:03.796
giving his right as your master to me.

126
10:07.645 --> 10:11.858
As a knight, my loyalty is
eternally pledged to Master Kayneth.

127
10:13.145 --> 10:16.985
Mistress Sola‐Ui, I'm sorry, but I cannot consent.

128
10:17.404 --> 10:18.425
You what?

129
10:18.695 --> 10:23.233
As a servant, do you not manifest
physically in this world using my mana?

130
10:23.400 --> 10:27.105
And now I also have Kayneth's
consent, as well as the Command Seals.

131
10:27.232 --> 10:29.664
Before I am a servant of the Grail War,

132
10:29.998 --> 10:31.450
I am foremost a knight,

133
10:31.875 --> 10:35.451
and a knight can only serve but one master.

134
10:35.665 --> 10:37.970
Am I so unworthy of being your master?

135
10:38.252 --> 10:40.412
I have already told you that is not the issue.

136
10:40.545 --> 10:42.396
Look me in the eye when you speak!

137
10:48.585 --> 10:51.726
Lancer, fight beside me.

138
10:52.105 --> 10:53.783
Please, you must protect me.

139
10:54.202 --> 10:55.598
Lend me your support.

140
10:55.870 --> 10:58.540
Come and help me win the Holy Grail!

141
10:59.985 --> 11:01.065
I cannot.

142
11:02.575 --> 11:05.391
If Master Kayneth has given up his quest for the Grail,

143
11:05.640 --> 11:07.710
then I no longer have any interest in it.

144
11:10.875 --> 11:14.779
We require a miracle to heal him.
He has no chance otherwise!

145
11:15.295 --> 11:18.238
We need the Grail for that miracle.

146
11:18.547 --> 11:21.528
If you're feeling responsible for all this,

147
11:22.045 --> 11:25.383
if you desire to give him back his life and his dignity,

148
11:25.947 --> 11:29.002
you must win the Holy Grail for your master.

149
11:31.765 --> 11:35.417
Mistress Sola‐Ui, do you speak as Master Kayneth's wife

150
11:35.895 --> 11:38.766
and seek the Holy Grail only on his behalf?

151
11:39.355 --> 11:40.829
Is that what you're saying?

152
11:41.735 --> 11:43.133
Uh, well, yes.

153
11:43.258 --> 11:44.268
Yes, of course.

154
11:45.115 --> 11:46.725
That is your only desire?

155
11:47.138 --> 11:48.176
You'll swear to it?

156
11:49.698 --> 11:50.844
Yes, I swear.

157
11:51.430 --> 11:54.310
As the wife of Lord Kayneth El‐Melloi,

158
11:54.625 --> 11:56.609
I shall bring my husband the Grail.

159
12:06.391 --> 12:07.852
That look in her eyes.

160
12:09.385 --> 12:11.296
It is the same as Grainne had.

161
12:15.294 --> 12:17.125
I don't hate them for what happened.

162
12:18.025 --> 12:22.230
However, fate was simply too cruel
to allow it to happen any other way.

163
12:25.641 --> 12:27.433
What I seek from this life

164
12:27.825 --> 12:30.150
is the loyalty denied me in my last.

165
12:30.995 --> 12:33.898
I wish to keep that sad fate from happening again.

166
12:34.662 --> 12:35.308
But...

167
12:37.335 --> 12:41.136
In my previous life, I threw myself into many battles...

168
12:42.533 --> 12:45.950
...oftentimes, ignoring the lives that would be lost,

169
12:46.505 --> 12:49.772
and, so, I understand Kiritsugu's reasoning.

170
12:51.595 --> 12:55.800
However, the Holy Grail War has very clear rules.

171
12:56.355 --> 12:59.528
It is supposed to be a proxy war conducted by servants

172
13:00.038 --> 13:02.118
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

173
13:02.904 --> 13:04.929
Isn't that true, Irisviel?

174
13:08.838 --> 13:10.605
If Kiritsugu and Lancer's master

175
13:11.170 --> 13:13.175
had not engaged in a secret battle,

176
13:13.441 --> 13:15.012
we could have struck down Caster.

177
13:16.075 --> 13:19.704
We would no longer have to worry about
more innocent children being killed.

178
13:20.545 --> 13:23.649
Lancer and I could have finished
our duel in an honorable fashion.

179
13:26.362 --> 13:29.599
Is there no chance of Kiritsugu changing his mind?

180
13:46.325 --> 13:48.953
If you believe only one thing, believe this:

181
13:50.235 --> 13:53.561
For Kiritsugu and me to make our ideal world a reality,

182
13:53.999 --> 13:55.820
you are absolutely essential.

183
14:02.944 --> 14:11.385
Uh...

184
14:12.523 --> 14:15.612
You know, it does a man good to watch you drink.

185
14:15.799 --> 14:16.559
Here.

186
14:16.919 --> 14:18.102
Oh, thank you.

187
14:18.602 --> 14:22.679
You should have told us you had a guest coming over.
I'd have cooked something special for you.

188
14:22.759 --> 14:24.723
No, no, don't trouble yourself.

189
14:25.063 --> 14:29.030
The simple pleasures of home and hearth
are what are truly best in this world.

190
14:29.124 --> 14:32.128
Oh, my, you are such a flatterer, aren't you?

191
14:35.131 --> 14:39.816
We couldn't help but worry over how
Waver was doing at his school in England,

192
14:40.176 --> 14:46.277
but if he's managed to make friends with a strapping man
like you, well, I guess we were worried over nothing.

193
14:46.554 --> 14:47.907
Hm, not at all.

194
14:48.182 --> 14:50.495
It is I who am in his debt.

195
14:51.290 --> 14:53.772
See, he even picked out these fine pants.

196
14:54.012 --> 14:54.939
Look at the craftsmanship.

197
14:55.285 --> 14:56.565
They're fit for a king.

198
14:57.315 --> 15:00.408
So, how long will you be in Japan, Alexei?

199
15:00.881 --> 15:04.978
Oh, I should have all my work here
wrapped up in about a week or so.

200
15:05.749 --> 15:09.885
Well, I was just thinking that, if you
like, you could stay right here with us.

201
15:10.219 --> 15:14.313
I'm pretty sure that there's space enough
to put another futon in Waver's room.

202
15:14.966 --> 15:16.036
Right, Waver?

203
15:16.396 --> 15:17.234
Futon?

204
15:17.496 --> 15:20.180
Oh, yes, the bedding that they sleep on in this land.

205
15:21.795 --> 15:24.810
Sleeping on a futon does take some getting used to.

206
15:25.209 --> 15:27.884
It's strange to sleep on the floor instead of a bed.

207
15:28.284 --> 15:31.872
I think that is what is best about
traveling to distant foreign lands.

208
15:32.192 --> 15:35.289
My favorite thing in life is
the surprise of the unknown.

209
15:35.635 --> 15:38.788
Surely, Asia gives me the most enjoyment in any age.

210
15:38.901 --> 15:41.209
I couldn't agree with you more.

211
15:45.256 --> 15:46.863
I've told you!

212
15:47.090 --> 15:51.179
Take the spiritual form
when you come and go!

213
15:51.286 --> 15:54.652
Yes, well, had I done so,
I would not have been able to retrieve this.

214
15:55.005 --> 15:57.905
I even managed to procure this fine pair of pants.

215
15:58.324 --> 16:02.332
And anyway, boy, it was you who ordered me to do it.

216
16:05.804 --> 16:11.698
Why must I, the King of Conquerors,
go forth to draw water from some country river?

217
16:11.845 --> 16:16.312
Because it's a lot more productive than eating
junk food and watching all those videos.

218
16:17.629 --> 16:18.274
Hmm.

219
16:22.832 --> 16:25.783
What is this, are you playing at being an alchemist?

220
16:25.929 --> 16:27.180
I'm not playing.

221
16:27.486 --> 16:29.501
I am an alchemist, idiot.

222
16:32.272 --> 16:34.300
How interesting, what is that?

223
16:34.644 --> 16:36.233
Spell casting residue,

224
16:36.632 --> 16:38.652
remnants of magic left in the water.

225
16:39.532 --> 16:43.069
And that means someone was recently
using magic near the river.

226
16:44.541 --> 16:45.850
If we follow the trail,

227
16:46.250 --> 16:48.758
it may be able to show us where to look for Caster.

228
16:49.704 --> 16:53.490
Hey, boy, did you know ahead of time that
you were gonna find something like that

229
16:53.663 --> 16:54.999
lurking out there in the water?

230
16:55.198 --> 16:59.593
Of course not, but this town is unique in
that water flows straight through its center,

231
17:00.319 --> 17:02.952
so water was the obvious place to look.

232
17:10.813 --> 17:14.697
Rider, was there anything between here and here?

233
17:15.519 --> 17:18.649
A sewage pipe, or maybe an irrigation channel?

234
17:18.987 --> 17:22.144
Oh, yes, there was one of considerable size down there.

235
17:22.609 --> 17:23.439
That's it.

236
17:23.952 --> 17:27.516
If we follow it, it will probably
lead us right to Caster's hideout.

237
17:28.046 --> 17:28.991
Hmm.

238
17:29.601 --> 17:34.300
Boy, are you certain you aren't a
mage of not inconsiderable skill?

239
17:34.567 --> 17:37.671
Look, a truly skilled mage
wouldn't have to do it this way.

240
17:38.252 --> 17:40.554
As a skill, it's pretty basic.

241
17:40.969 --> 17:43.711
Wait a minute, you're making fun of me, aren't you?

242
17:44.035 --> 17:45.682
No, boy, quite the opposite.

243
17:45.949 --> 17:48.202
To accomplish something so impressive

244
17:48.514 --> 17:52.858
using a simple method outshines those
who use a more complex technique.

245
17:53.284 --> 17:55.641
As your servant, I am proud.

246
17:55.994 --> 17:56.952
Right.

247
17:57.434 --> 18:00.309
Now that we have his location, he's as good as ours.

248
18:00.562 --> 18:03.810
Shall we go give him a good beating right away, boy?

249
18:05.319 --> 18:06.472
Wait a second.

250
18:06.824 --> 18:09.431
We're talking about engaging Caster here.

251
18:09.657 --> 18:10.358
I know.

252
18:10.383 --> 18:11.443
No, you don't.

253
18:11.956 --> 18:13.829
When it comes to defending his lair,

254
18:14.057 --> 18:16.522
he has a tremendous advantage over any attacker.

255
18:16.909 --> 18:20.230
What kind of moron would just
go bursting in the front door?

256
18:21.481 --> 18:27.584
Listen here, in a combat situation, enemy and ally
positions can practically change by the second.

257
18:28.043 --> 18:31.275
If you fail to attack the enemy
when you know his location,

258
18:31.724 --> 18:34.699
it will be too late for regrets
once you've missed your chance.

259
18:35.059 --> 18:38.218
Really, and what's made you so eager today?

260
18:38.478 --> 18:39.679
Shouldn't I be?

261
18:39.891 --> 18:43.999
My master has finally contributed
something of worth to our great endeavor.

262
18:44.262 --> 18:48.041
As your loyal servant, I must also do my sacred duty.

263
18:48.215 --> 18:49.609
Seek out and defeat the enemy

264
18:49.609 --> 18:51.643
and bring back his head to you.

265
18:52.407 --> 18:56.341
Ha‐ha, do not be so quick to give
up before we have even begun.

266
18:56.781 --> 18:59.150
Let us go and see what we can find.

267
18:59.960 --> 19:02.607
It may well work out better than you imagine.

268
19:04.289 --> 19:05.783
Ah!

269
19:07.051 --> 19:08.811
You see, I was right, wasn't I?

270
19:09.025 --> 19:11.042
Everything has worked out splendidly!

271
19:18.353 --> 19:22.072
Hmm, unfortunately, Caster appears to be away.

272
19:24.518 --> 19:27.221
Is this some kind of water storage system?

273
19:27.896 --> 19:31.751
Hey, boy, I think it would be
best if you didn't see this.

274
19:32.069 --> 19:33.644
What are you talking about?

275
19:34.084 --> 19:37.699
If Caster isn't here, we should at least
search for clues to his whereabouts.

276
19:37.823 --> 19:39.271
It'd be dumb not to.

277
19:39.644 --> 19:42.439
That may be so, but don't do it.

278
19:42.839 --> 19:45.223
Boy, this is far too much for you.

279
19:45.629 --> 19:46.940
Oh, shut up.

280
20:18.598 --> 20:20.314
I warned you, didn't I?

281
20:20.989 --> 20:22.743
I told you not to look.

282
20:22.949 --> 20:23.926
Shut up!

283
20:24.431 --> 20:27.297
Damn it, stop making fun of me.

284
20:28.169 --> 20:29.439
Damn it.

285
20:29.926 --> 20:32.696
This is no time for pride, foolish boy.

286
20:33.186 --> 20:34.770
Your reaction is natural.

287
20:35.310 --> 20:41.522
If I saw someone who could look on all of this
and still remain unmoved, I would punch them hard.

288
20:42.146 --> 20:45.392
What do you mean you'd punch them, you idiot.

289
20:45.889 --> 20:47.269
What about you?

290
20:47.649 --> 20:51.191
You look fine, just like you always do.

291
20:52.479 --> 20:56.377
That's because now is not the time for emotion.

292
20:56.819 --> 20:57.610
Huh?

293
21:03.144 --> 21:06.339
Because my young master is in mortal peril!

294
21:08.629 --> 21:09.449
Assassin?

295
21:09.669 --> 21:11.324
But that's impossible.

296
21:11.669 --> 21:12.999
Assassin's dead.

297
21:13.092 --> 21:14.623
I saw him die.

298
21:15.919 --> 21:18.626
We can't afford to be surprised, boy.

299
21:35.819 --> 21:36.756
But how?

300
21:37.242 --> 21:40.329
The how of it is totally irrelevant to us now.

301
21:40.979 --> 21:43.226
However, one thing here is for certain.

302
21:43.623 --> 21:49.451
Anyone in this war who believed in Assassin's untimely
demise, as we did, has been thoroughly deceived.

303
21:55.326 --> 21:56.160
They ran.

304
21:56.509 --> 21:57.439
Didn't they?

305
21:57.748 --> 21:59.334
Do not let your guard down.

306
21:59.889 --> 22:00.789
We killed two,

307
22:01.204 --> 22:03.098
but there appeared to be an additional two.

308
22:03.744 --> 22:08.229
At this rate, who can say how many
assassins there truly are out there?

309
22:09.124 --> 22:11.191
This is Assassin's preferred terrain.

310
22:11.753 --> 22:13.874
We should withdraw from here at once.

311
22:14.507 --> 22:17.684
Should we really leave it like this?

312
22:18.257 --> 22:20.486
Perhaps you'd find something if you were to look,

313
22:20.979 --> 22:21.929
but let it go.

314
22:24.111 --> 22:26.679
For now, we'll just have to break what we can.

315
22:27.119 --> 22:30.245
If nothing else, it will serve to slow Caster down.

316
22:57.799 --> 23:00.327
With his hideout destroyed and completely in ruins,

317
23:00.654 --> 23:02.780
Caster will no longer be able to hide.

318
23:03.126 --> 23:07.052
He'll be forced to come out of the
shadows, into the open, and show himself.

319
23:08.259 --> 23:10.227
Then after that, it won't be too long

320
23:10.567 --> 23:12.571
before we put an end to him and his master.

321
23:13.788 --> 23:15.248
All right.

322
23:15.339 --> 23:16.511
I get it!

323
23:16.919 --> 23:18.131
Quit doing that!

324
23:21.199 --> 23:22.792
Let us be off, boy.

325
23:30.280 --> 23:32.154
Do not let it trouble you, Kirei.

326
23:32.642 --> 23:36.297
Indeed, it is unfortunate that
Assassin was exposed to them

327
23:36.617 --> 23:39.704
before we could discern the
nature of Rider's ultimate weapon.

328
23:40.189 --> 23:41.571
But from this encounter,

329
23:41.824 --> 23:45.384
we found out that Rider's master
is a mere third‐rate mage.

330
23:45.577 --> 23:48.659
Yes, but had they not been discovered...

331
23:48.816 --> 23:51.922
You think that other options would
have become available to you?

332
23:52.159 --> 23:53.148
Yes.

333
23:53.789 --> 23:54.501
Hm.

334
23:55.163 --> 23:57.211
While your plans are certainly important,

335
23:57.731 --> 24:01.726
you must see to it that you remain
refined and relaxed in all matters.

336
24:02.450 --> 24:05.265
Dignity is required even during battle.

337
24:05.759 --> 24:09.235
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

338
24:11.840 --> 24:15.331
We will certainly have another chance
to see Rider's ultimate attack.

339
24:16.039 --> 24:18.359
Have Assassin to continue to monitor Rider,

340
24:18.641 --> 24:21.382
but remind them to take great care as they do.

341
24:22.386 --> 24:25.194
Yes, my teacher, it will be done.
