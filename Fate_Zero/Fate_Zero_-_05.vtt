1
00:05.526 --> 00:08.059
I am Iskandar, the King of Conquerors!

2
00:08.565 --> 00:10.215
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

3
00:10.532 --> 00:12.607
I am of the Rider Class of Servants.

4
00:14.740 --> 00:17.786
Wh... what the hell are you thinking
announcing yourself that way?

5
00:17.811 --> 00:18.750
You idiot!

6
00:18.750 --> 00:19.491
Ow!

7
00:19.685 --> 00:20.711
Ow...

8
00:23.363 --> 00:28.277
Fate has brought us all together in this place to
do battle for the possession of the Holy Grail.

9
00:28.810 --> 00:32.540
But first, I wish to make a proposition and offer.

10
00:33.793 --> 00:38.655
What think you of yielding the Holy Grail to
me and joining my glorious and invincible army?

11
00:39.135 --> 00:42.442
You will be treated as honored
allies, friends, and brothers in arms!

12
00:42.775 --> 00:47.281
Together we shall share in the glory of
battle and the joy of world conquest!

13
00:49.610 --> 00:50.331
Hm.

14
00:51.072 --> 00:53.483
I'm afraid that I must decline your offer.

15
00:53.883 --> 00:55.923
As tempting as that offer may be,

16
00:56.290 --> 00:58.477
I may give the Grail to but one man.

17
00:58.530 --> 01:00.699
My new avowed lord and Master.

18
01:01.244 --> 01:04.371
And not to the likes of you, Rider!

19
01:04.653 --> 01:05.743
Tell me, Rider.

20
01:05.991 --> 01:09.358
Did you come here and interfere
with our battle, rudely,

21
01:09.567 --> 01:12.762
merely to proffer that ridiculous
and laughable plan of yours?

22
01:13.130 --> 01:15.653
This is a grave offense against my honor!

23
01:16.019 --> 01:16.768
Hmm.

24
01:18.314 --> 01:20.821
I'd be willing to discuss compensation.

25
01:21.021 --> 01:21.827
Enough!

26
01:23.507 --> 01:24.133
Hm.

27
01:24.587 --> 01:25.487
And further,

28
01:26.315 --> 01:30.320
I am the rightful king of Britain
and not merely a knight of the realm.

29
01:30.609 --> 01:34.244
I could never lower myself to mere
retainer, even to a mighty king!

30
01:34.664 --> 01:36.660
Ooh, you are king of Britain?

31
01:36.895 --> 01:38.096
That is quite a surprise!

32
01:38.430 --> 01:41.660
I would hardly have expected the
King of Knights to be a little girl.

33
01:42.830 --> 01:47.561
Then would you like to taste of this
little girl's blade, King of Conquerors?

34
01:49.282 --> 01:51.488
I suppose negotiations have failed.

35
01:51.641 --> 01:53.030
Such a terrible waste.

36
01:53.310 --> 01:54.911
A truly awful shame.

37
01:55.510 --> 01:58.430
Rider!

38
03:39.944 --> 03:40.879
I can't believe it.

39
03:41.017 --> 03:43.388
That moron nearly conquered the known world?

40
03:44.567 --> 03:45.967
What the hell is wrong with you?

41
03:46.074 --> 03:49.613
So, you were the one who did it, huh?

42
03:51.914 --> 03:58.334
I'd been wondering what twisted madness had invaded
your psyche and compelled you to steal my relic.

43
03:59.384 --> 04:04.553
I never even imagined that you yourself had
being planning to enter the Holy Grail War.

44
04:05.226 --> 04:06.886
Waver...

45
04:07.094 --> 04:08.859
Velvet?

46
04:10.040 --> 04:12.901
Now I know you're not experienced in these matters.

47
04:13.455 --> 04:17.088
How would you like me to offer you a private lesson?

48
04:17.520 --> 04:21.440
What it really means for mages to kill one another?

49
04:21.686 --> 04:26.280
I'll teach you all about the fear and
pain involved in such noble endeavors.

50
04:26.815 --> 04:29.137
You should feel honored.

51
04:34.294 --> 04:35.038
Hm.

52
04:35.584 --> 04:37.421
Mage who is speaking now,

53
04:37.790 --> 04:44.108
do I understand correctly that you believe you were to
be my Master rather than this boy I'm sworn to serve?

54
04:44.675 --> 04:47.041
That whole idea is absurd and laughable!

55
04:47.502 --> 04:53.792
Only one brave enough to openly ride onto the battlefield
standing at my side could ever hope to be my Master!

56
04:54.180 --> 04:57.355
A coward who lacks sufficient courage to show himself

57
04:57.700 --> 05:00.333
is nowhere close to being worthy of me!

58
05:06.122 --> 05:08.379
Of course, there are also others!

59
05:08.812 --> 05:11.634
They're out there skulking in the darkness, watching us!

60
05:11.742 --> 05:13.716
What are you talking about, Rider?

61
05:14.942 --> 05:16.748
Saber and Lancer,

62
05:17.534 --> 05:19.769
the skills and bravery you showed were impressive!

63
05:19.994 --> 05:21.536
Your duel was magnificent!

64
05:22.256 --> 05:25.328
Surely the sound of your blades
and the fury of your battle

65
05:25.508 --> 05:30.327
called other Heroic Spirits here to bear
witness and glean knowledge from your encounter.

66
05:30.735 --> 05:31.415
Heroic Spirits,

67
05:31.982 --> 05:33.859
born again through the Holy Grail,

68
05:34.012 --> 05:35.514
gather here and now!

69
05:35.907 --> 05:39.255
Those too craven and cowardly
to show themselves here tonight

70
05:39.629 --> 05:43.094
will draw the vicious scorn of Iskandar,

71
05:43.220 --> 05:45.364
King of Conquerors!

72
05:48.534 --> 05:49.347
Kirei.

73
05:49.941 --> 05:50.840
Yes?

74
05:51.047 --> 05:52.674
This is not good.

75
05:53.440 --> 05:55.167
Not good indeed.

76
06:03.841 --> 06:05.107
Oh no, that's him!

77
06:05.349 --> 06:07.689
The Servant that defeated Assassin?

78
06:10.566 --> 06:14.487
So, two lesser beings dare to name themselves kings

79
06:14.987 --> 06:16.913
even in my royal presence.

80
06:17.320 --> 06:19.850
I fail to see where the problem lies, Servant?

81
06:20.690 --> 06:22.063
For I am Iskandar,

82
06:22.558 --> 06:26.064
the legendary King of Conquerors known
through all the lands of the world.

83
06:26.417 --> 06:27.701
What nonsense!

84
06:27.961 --> 06:31.669
You're deluding yourself!
I am the one true king of the world!

85
06:32.009 --> 06:33.348
All others are mongrels!

86
06:33.574 --> 06:34.961
Pretenders to the name!

87
06:35.152 --> 06:38.818
If you are that insistent of your
claim, then why not name yourself?

88
06:39.145 --> 06:44.614
No true king should be troubled by something as simple
as giving his name to those he wishes to challenge.

89
06:44.874 --> 06:47.620
So, you would question me, you filthy mongrel?

90
06:48.047 --> 06:50.379
Me, the one true king?

91
06:50.713 --> 06:56.040
If you cannot now discern my identity
in the presence of my magnificent glory,

92
06:56.146 --> 06:59.921
then your ignorant blindness
will serve to seal your doom!

93
07:03.734 --> 07:04.539
I see now.

94
07:04.765 --> 07:06.634
That is how he killed Assassin.

95
07:10.234 --> 07:12.571
That is his Noble Phantasm.

96
07:21.332 --> 07:22.472
Kill them all.

97
07:32.384 --> 07:33.555
Berserker?

98
07:35.174 --> 07:36.747
So, King of Conquerors,

99
07:36.907 --> 07:39.060
are you planning to ask him to join too?

100
07:39.413 --> 07:40.253
Perhaps not.

101
07:40.546 --> 07:44.945
He doesn't seem terribly interested in
civilized negotiations of any kind, does he?

102
07:45.309 --> 07:46.209
Hey there, boy.

103
07:46.489 --> 07:49.432
How powerful a Servant is this monster, huh?

104
07:50.494 --> 07:51.607
I don't know.

105
07:51.807 --> 07:53.074
I can't really tell.

106
07:53.313 --> 07:54.511
What do you mean, boy?

107
07:54.751 --> 07:57.288
Are you not a Master chosen by the Holy Grail?

108
07:57.661 --> 08:02.538
You're supposed to be able to sense all
their strengths and weaknesses, aren't you?

109
08:04.754 --> 08:06.432
I can't tell anything.

110
08:06.659 --> 08:09.411
That black thing is definitely a Servant,

111
08:09.831 --> 08:12.992
but I can't read its status or anything else!

112
08:13.641 --> 08:14.354
Hmm.

113
08:15.156 --> 08:18.586
It appears you'll be facing another difficult enemy.

114
08:18.679 --> 08:19.934
Yes, so it seems.

115
08:20.174 --> 08:22.436
That spirit has some curse or other ability.

116
08:22.949 --> 08:25.931
It fully conceals nearly everything about him.

117
08:26.666 --> 08:27.777
But that isn't all.

118
08:28.378 --> 08:32.044
With four other Servants present,
we have to be very careful.

119
08:33.837 --> 08:35.843
Why did he materialize here?

120
08:36.692 --> 08:38.898
No sane Master would ever choose

121
08:39.391 --> 08:42.299
to send their Servant out here under these circumstances,

122
08:42.639 --> 08:45.943
certainly not right into the middle of all this chaos.

123
08:46.502 --> 08:49.022
Maiya, keep watching Assassin.

124
08:49.784 --> 08:51.657
I'll look for Berserker's Master.

125
08:58.218 --> 09:00.791
Who gave you permission to look upon me?

126
09:00.991 --> 09:02.571
You rabid dog.

127
09:04.714 --> 09:09.400
May your death provide me some
modicum of entertainment, mongrel!

128
09:18.694 --> 09:19.752
Good God!

129
09:20.005 --> 09:21.411
Is that truly Berserker?

130
09:22.105 --> 09:25.026
For a madman completely devoid of a soul or conscience,

131
09:25.292 --> 09:27.370
huh, he is rather nimble.

132
09:27.643 --> 09:28.150
Huh?

133
09:28.521 --> 09:29.174
Come now.

134
09:29.400 --> 09:30.987
Couldn't you tell what he did?

135
09:31.340 --> 09:35.714
That black thing casually snatched the first
blade that was flying toward him out of the air

136
09:35.977 --> 09:38.554
and used it to deflect the second spear.

137
09:43.268 --> 09:46.941
You dare lay your filthy hands
on my precious treasures.

138
09:47.301 --> 09:50.442
You must long for a painful death, cur!

139
09:53.223 --> 09:55.203
No way, that's impossible!

140
09:56.218 --> 09:58.000
All right now, mongrel.

141
09:58.413 --> 10:00.963
Let us all just see how long your parlor tricks

142
10:01.454 --> 10:03.323
can keep you alive now!

143
10:51.465 --> 10:52.319
Fool...

144
10:52.759 --> 10:54.405
I belong among the heavens,

145
10:55.367 --> 10:57.844
yet you would have me trod upon the ground?

146
10:58.220 --> 11:00.461
Your impudence has guaranteed your death!

147
11:01.014 --> 11:01.661
Mongrel!

148
11:02.174 --> 11:05.304
When I am through with you,
nothing will remain of your corpse!

149
11:11.218 --> 11:13.284
Gilgamesh is serious.

150
11:15.672 --> 11:18.932
He plans to open the Gate of Babylon even further.

151
11:19.553 --> 11:23.499
Repeatedly exposing his Noble
Phantasm to all the others.

152
11:23.612 --> 11:24.980
Very rash of him.

153
11:25.767 --> 11:27.667
Your decision, my Master.

154
11:33.064 --> 11:35.223
By the power of my Command Seal.

155
11:35.438 --> 11:38.897
King of Heroes, quell thine anger and withdraw.

156
11:41.855 --> 11:46.019
You dare to order a king to
withdraw, to leave the fight undone?

157
11:46.469 --> 11:48.667
You have much nerve, Tokiomi!

158
11:53.729 --> 11:55.836
You were fortunate, mad dog.

159
11:56.312 --> 11:57.652
You mongrels!

160
11:57.899 --> 11:58.715
By our next meeting,

161
11:58.874 --> 12:00.704
see that you culled your numbers!

162
12:00.861 --> 12:04.405
Only a true hero is worthy to
look upon my glorious presence!

163
12:08.029 --> 12:08.632
Hm.

164
12:08.899 --> 12:14.648
It would seem that Archer's Master has much less
fortitude and is far less courageous than he is.

165
12:27.759 --> 12:28.584
Irisviel!

166
12:28.824 --> 12:29.517
Get back!

167
12:38.331 --> 12:39.131
What?

168
12:47.319 --> 12:48.774
So that's what it is.

169
12:49.504 --> 12:53.917
Whatever he grabs onto with his
hands becomes his Noble Phantasm.

170
12:57.619 --> 12:58.844
Saber!

171
13:03.245 --> 13:04.807
Hey, Maiya,

172
13:05.589 --> 13:08.348
have you gotten any visual on Berserker's Master?

173
13:08.469 --> 13:09.787
No, I haven't.

174
13:12.599 --> 13:13.762
This looks bad.

175
13:14.639 --> 13:15.197
Damn.

176
13:17.599 --> 13:19.525
What are you, monster?

177
13:38.558 --> 13:43.087
That's quite enough messing around for now, Berserker!

178
13:43.513 --> 13:47.203
You see, Saber has a prior engagement.

179
13:47.650 --> 13:50.533
If you insist on interfering with that obligation,

180
13:50.839 --> 13:52.542
you'll have to face me.

181
13:52.983 --> 13:53.990
Lancer...

182
13:54.936 --> 13:56.989
What are you doing, Lancer?

183
13:57.611 --> 14:00.950
This is your chance to defeat Saber and take her out of play.

184
14:02.312 --> 14:03.385
My Master!

185
14:03.672 --> 14:05.862
I, Diarmuid,
will defeat Saber!

186
14:06.129 --> 14:07.970
I swear it upon my honor!

187
14:08.264 --> 14:10.425
If you insist I kill her here and now,

188
14:10.558 --> 14:13.145
then I will first defeat that mad dog Berserker!

189
14:13.438 --> 14:16.170
Please, my Master, let it be so!

190
14:18.402 --> 14:20.539
With my Command Seal, I order you.

191
14:20.642 --> 14:21.709
My lord!

192
14:23.129 --> 14:26.520
You are to help Berserker kill Saber!

193
14:27.487 --> 14:28.362
Now!

194
14:37.328 --> 14:38.557
Lancer!

195
14:49.902 --> 14:52.344
Sorry, Saber.

196
14:55.267 --> 14:56.374
Irisviel, listen!

197
14:56.627 --> 14:57.940
I shall hold them here!

198
14:58.218 --> 15:01.804
While I do that, you must leave
this place as quickly as possible!

199
15:01.859 --> 15:02.405
Run!

200
15:02.473 --> 15:04.195
Get as far away as you can!

201
15:05.702 --> 15:06.888
Irisviel, please!

202
15:07.135 --> 15:08.081
Run away!

203
15:08.523 --> 15:10.016
It's all right, Saber.

204
15:11.271 --> 15:12.738
Please believe in your Master!

205
15:15.412 --> 15:16.972
Kiritsugu is here?

206
15:18.599 --> 15:22.173
Kiritsugu, I know that you can
still turn this to a victory!

207
15:23.798 --> 15:27.187
All right, I'll kill Lancer's Master now.

208
15:27.760 --> 15:30.155
It's the only way out of this situation.

209
15:30.541 --> 15:34.811
Maiya, proceed with your attack of Assassin on my mark.

210
15:35.159 --> 15:36.626
Suppressive fire.

211
15:37.029 --> 15:38.479
Right, acknowledged.

212
15:43.025 --> 15:44.106
Six.

213
15:45.274 --> 15:46.214
Five.

214
15:47.669 --> 15:48.703
Four.

215
15:49.999 --> 15:50.893
Three.

216
15:52.919 --> 15:53.761
Two.

217
15:56.139 --> 15:56.767
One.

218
16:02.809 --> 16:04.559
Rider?

219
16:23.539 --> 16:27.646
Ah, this Servant is quite a tough one, isn't he?

220
16:34.219 --> 16:38.620
Well, as you can see, our dark malevolent
friend will be retiring for the evening.

221
16:39.349 --> 16:41.077
Master of Lancer!

222
16:41.357 --> 16:43.492
I know not from whence you are watching,

223
16:43.945 --> 16:47.682
but do not sully a battle between
knights with your petty tricks!

224
16:47.962 --> 16:49.475
Have Lancer withdraw.

225
16:49.867 --> 16:52.242
If you insist on humiliating him further,

226
16:52.736 --> 16:55.026
then I shall join Saber against him.

227
16:55.495 --> 16:59.529
And I assure you that together the two
of us will annihilate your Servant.

228
16:59.989 --> 17:01.122
What will it be?

229
17:04.665 --> 17:06.492
Fine; Withdraw, Lancer.

230
17:06.869 --> 17:08.785
That's enough for tonight.

231
17:10.169 --> 17:12.639
My thanks, King of Conquers.

232
17:12.709 --> 17:13.885
It was nothing.

233
17:14.147 --> 17:16.507
The flowers of a battlefield must bloom.

234
17:30.277 --> 17:31.215
I must know.

235
17:31.407 --> 17:33.397
What was your purpose in coming here,

236
17:33.859 --> 17:35.063
King of Conquers?

237
17:35.303 --> 17:39.304
Well, honestly, I try not to
think too hard about such things.

238
17:40.447 --> 17:44.178
Saber, first settle matters with Lancer and battle.

239
17:45.224 --> 17:48.366
And then, I shall face the victor of your contest.

240
17:48.785 --> 17:50.612
Be it you or Lancer.

241
17:50.856 --> 17:53.355
Well, King of Knights, goodbye for the moment!

242
17:53.637 --> 17:54.502
It was a pleasure,

243
17:54.637 --> 17:56.741
and I sincerely hope to enjoy our next meeting

244
17:56.927 --> 17:58.370
as much as I did this one.

245
17:58.712 --> 18:02.957
Hey, boy, don't you have
anything nice to say to the lady?

246
18:03.782 --> 18:04.303
Hm?

247
18:08.357 --> 18:10.803
I really do wish he'd man up a little.

248
18:11.010 --> 18:11.910
Oh, well.

249
18:17.481 --> 18:18.788
Fare thee well!

250
18:23.327 --> 18:24.053
Saber!

251
18:24.247 --> 18:25.575
Your left arm!

252
18:25.747 --> 18:28.167
Yes, it was a painful blow.

253
18:28.547 --> 18:29.996
It is as Rider says.

254
18:30.127 --> 18:34.317
If I fail to deal with Lancer first
and undo the curse on this wound,

255
18:34.467 --> 18:37.545
it will damage my chances against the other Servants.

256
18:40.517 --> 18:41.685
Thank you, Saber.

257
18:42.847 --> 18:44.727
I survived thanks to you.

258
18:45.569 --> 18:48.290
The reason I could focus on the battle before me

259
18:48.527 --> 18:50.905
was because I had you to stand behind me.

260
18:52.382 --> 18:53.231
Saber.

261
18:54.317 --> 18:56.657
The battle is only beginning, Irisviel.

262
18:56.838 --> 19:02.286
Tonight we saw the opening gambits have an epic
battle that is only just beginning to unfold.

263
19:03.967 --> 19:04.725
I know.

264
19:05.207 --> 19:07.607
They were all powerful adversaries.

265
19:08.247 --> 19:10.877
Not one of them was a conventional enemy.

266
19:12.127 --> 19:15.153
So this is the Holy Grail War.

267
19:19.434 --> 19:23.597
He turned and ran like a cowardly
rat away from my Berserker.

268
19:24.977 --> 19:29.025
And I also got to embarrass that stupid arrogant ass.

269
19:29.277 --> 19:33.197
Tokiomi, how I wish I could
have seen the look on your face.

270
19:41.157 --> 19:45.475
That damn Berserker broke free of my
control and started fighting Saber.

271
19:45.587 --> 19:46.389
Bastard!

272
19:46.747 --> 19:50.179
If he keeps doing that, my body won't last long.

273
19:50.667 --> 19:52.198
But if I can
control him,

274
19:52.587 --> 19:53.847
I can win.

275
19:58.752 --> 20:01.587
Just hold on, Sakura.

276
20:06.937 --> 20:09.377
Begging your pardon, Master Kirei.

277
20:09.660 --> 20:10.564
What is it?

278
20:10.857 --> 20:16.929
Master, I've come to report that I've found
something of interest outside the church.

279
20:17.237 --> 20:18.308
A familiar?

280
20:18.853 --> 20:19.603
Yes.

281
20:19.697 --> 20:21.627
It was outside the barrier.

282
20:22.060 --> 20:26.188
But it was clearly sent here for the
purpose of monitoring this church.

283
20:33.430 --> 20:34.642
Awesome!

284
20:34.667 --> 20:36.743
That was so awesome!

285
20:36.967 --> 20:37.797
Hey, Bluebeard!

286
20:37.922 --> 20:39.271
That was all real, right?

287
20:39.637 --> 20:40.702
Right?

288
20:41.043 --> 20:42.123
It was for real!

289
20:42.239 --> 20:44.536
Not some kind of cool special effect, right?

290
20:44.887 --> 20:46.158
So awesome!

291
20:46.517 --> 20:48.647
So, about this Grail War,

292
20:48.715 --> 20:50.075
you're gonna do it, aren't ya?

293
20:50.412 --> 20:51.620
Right, big guy?

294
20:53.378 --> 20:54.595
Ah...big guy?

295
20:55.647 --> 20:57.299
My wish has come true.

296
20:58.197 --> 21:00.202
What do you mean by, uh,

297
21:00.737 --> 21:01.980
wish come true?

298
21:05.827 --> 21:08.703
Look at her!
The answer to my prayer!

299
21:08.827 --> 21:10.694
Her extraordinary face,

300
21:10.843 --> 21:13.107
her strong and noble bearing!

301
21:13.297 --> 21:16.223
She is none other than the maiden of my dreams!

302
21:16.406 --> 21:19.058
The one perfect woman in the world!

303
21:23.927 --> 21:25.123
You know this chick?

304
21:25.340 --> 21:26.590
Yes indeed!

305
21:26.637 --> 21:28.595
She was forsaken by God!

306
21:28.715 --> 21:32.227
Died in abject shame and terrible loneliness and now,

307
21:32.354 --> 21:34.840
at last, she has come back to life!

308
21:35.013 --> 21:37.281
It is such a miracle!

309
21:37.428 --> 21:38.461
What else could it be

310
21:38.588 --> 21:41.358
but the fulfillment of all my hopes and dreams!

311
21:42.063 --> 21:43.999
Oh, maiden.

312
21:44.697 --> 21:46.625
My holy virgin!

313
21:47.367 --> 21:50.381
Soon I will come for you!
