1
00:13.528 --> 00:15.109
Master Kiritsugu!

2
00:19.208 --> 00:21.132
Your child has been born.

3
00:24.723 --> 00:27.877
She's so cute, she's adorable,

4
00:28.607 --> 00:31.395
and so small, so very delicate.

5
00:32.803 --> 00:34.161
Look, Kiritsugu.

6
00:34.985 --> 00:36.823
She has your eyes too.

7
00:40.951 --> 00:42.192
She's beautiful.

8
00:42.705 --> 00:45.311
I'm so happy that I could give birth to her.

9
00:51.589 --> 00:54.728
Iri, I...

10
00:57.072 --> 00:59.223
I will be the cause of your death.

11
01:06.073 --> 01:07.073
I know.

12
01:07.862 --> 01:10.288
The Einzberns have dreamed of the day.

13
01:10.585 --> 01:12.998
It is the very reason I exist.

14
01:13.363 --> 01:15.482
When I came to know your ideals,

15
01:15.638 --> 01:17.515
I made your wish my own.

16
01:17.878 --> 01:20.575
You made me who I am today.

17
01:20.983 --> 01:23.062
You have guided me on my path.

18
01:24.075 --> 01:27.818
You offered me a better life
than that of a simple puppet.

19
01:28.986 --> 01:33.841
You needn't pity me, because I am part of you already.

20
01:35.000 --> 01:35.696
So

21
01:35.721 --> 01:36.375
But...

22
01:39.002 --> 01:43.148
I have no right to hold that child.

23
01:44.778 --> 01:45.711
None.

24
01:49.714 --> 01:52.080
Kiritsugu, don't forget.

25
01:53.572 --> 01:56.037
You're striving to make a whole new world

26
01:56.492 --> 01:57.781
where no one cries.

27
01:58.857 --> 02:01.289
This is what your whole life has been about.

28
02:03.337 --> 02:07.090
Eight more years, and your fight will come to an end,

29
02:08.743 --> 02:11.210
and our ideal will become reality.

30
02:11.917 --> 02:13.774
The Holy Grail will save you.

31
02:14.283 --> 02:15.549
I'm certain of it.

32
02:17.410 --> 02:22.245
So take this child, Ilyasviel, and hold her close.

33
02:23.082 --> 02:27.575
Hold her and be proud, like any other father would be.

34
03:03.830 --> 03:05.016
A Command Seal?

35
03:05.188 --> 03:05.910
Yes.

36
03:06.071 --> 03:09.456
The mark identifies you as a
participant in the Holy Grail War.

37
03:09.940 --> 03:13.855
A stigmata bestowing upon you
the power to command a servant.

38
03:15.960 --> 03:17.318
Kirei Kotomine.

39
03:18.800 --> 03:20.789
The Holy Grail War,

40
03:20.998 --> 03:24.391
the battle for an ancient relic that performs miracles.

41
03:25.180 --> 03:26.228
But why me?

42
03:26.655 --> 03:33.658
Normally, those chosen by the Grail as masters for
the servants are experienced and accomplished mages.

43
03:33.733 --> 03:36.272
It is highly unusual for someone like you,

44
03:36.312 --> 03:40.838
who has no connection to magic
whatsoever, to be chosen to participate.

45
03:41.240 --> 03:42.731
Heroic servants.

46
03:43.274 --> 03:48.443
I still find it strange to command the summoned
spirits of ancient heroes to fight as familiars.

47
03:48.490 --> 03:52.580
Of course, I know all this can
be very difficult to believe,

48
03:52.840 --> 03:56.781
but heroes from every age and nation will
come back to life in the modern world,

49
03:57.000 --> 03:59.027
killing one another to vie for supremacy.

50
04:01.101 --> 04:02.985
That is the Holy Grail War.

51
04:03.145 --> 04:06.550
Also, there is an unspoken agreement among all involved

52
04:06.677 --> 04:08.135
to keep this all secret.

53
04:08.336 --> 04:10.015
To ensure this rule is kept,

54
04:10.239 --> 04:13.803
someone of the Holy Church is
always sent as an observer.

55
04:14.396 --> 04:16.593
Should one of us really be judging?

56
04:17.033 --> 04:19.939
A secret battle between godless magicians?

57
04:20.113 --> 04:22.143
A Mage's Association member

58
04:22.667 --> 04:25.755
would be too partial to one party to assure fairness.

59
04:27.184 --> 04:28.624
And so once again,

60
04:28.760 --> 04:31.074
just as we did some 60 years ago,

61
04:31.156 --> 04:34.700
we've recruited your father to
watch over and referee our battle.

62
04:34.889 --> 04:36.955
My father will be coming to Fuyuki?

63
04:38.383 --> 04:41.304
But wait, how can this be considered fair?

64
04:41.554 --> 04:45.517
It's a conflict of interest for the
overseer's child to also be a participant.

65
04:45.840 --> 04:46.750
Tokiomi?

66
04:47.783 --> 04:50.067
Perhaps it's time we got to the point.

67
04:51.467 --> 04:57.542
Kirei, everything we've spoken of thus far is just
the official background of the Holy Grail War.

68
04:58.043 --> 05:04.051
However, there is an additional reason I've
introduced you to Mr. Tokiomi Tohsaka here today.

69
05:04.570 --> 05:06.200
And what would that be?

70
05:06.389 --> 05:11.405
Actually, we found proof a long time ago that
the Holy Grail that will appear in Fuyuki

71
05:11.558 --> 05:14.582
is not the sacred relic that belonged to the Son of God.

72
05:15.433 --> 05:16.537
So I gathered

73
05:16.836 --> 05:22.189
Otherwise, an order to retrieve it would've been
given to us of the Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

74
05:22.669 --> 05:27.135
Be that as it may, Fuyuki's Holy
Grail is far too powerful to ignore.

75
05:27.215 --> 05:29.861
It is an omnipotent wish‐granting device.

76
05:30.054 --> 05:34.630
Who knows what disaster it could unleash
should it happen to fall into the wrong hands.

77
05:35.020 --> 05:36.193
In which case,

78
05:36.384 --> 05:41.900
the best course of action would be to ensure
that the Fuyuki Grail falls into the right hands,

79
05:42.020 --> 05:43.938
hands that would not misuse it.

80
05:44.496 --> 05:46.963
The Tohsakas are a family of mages,

81
05:47.116 --> 05:50.767
but they are mages with a long
history of friendship with the Church.

82
05:51.250 --> 05:55.420
We know what kind of person Tokiomi is,
and more important than anything else,

83
05:55.520 --> 05:59.691
the Tohsakas' ultimate intentions for
the Grail are plain and honorable.

84
06:00.210 --> 06:01.912
To reach the root.

85
06:02.472 --> 06:05.565
That is the Tohsaka family's sole desire.

86
06:05.809 --> 06:10.452
But the Einzberns and Matous have both
forgotten the wish we once shared with them,

87
06:10.659 --> 06:13.438
and have other less altruistic plans now.

88
06:13.931 --> 06:18.523
It goes without saying that the plans
of the other masters will be even worse.

89
06:18.957 --> 06:24.090
Who knows what dark desire they may harbor for
the power of the Grail should they obtain it.

90
06:24.577 --> 06:30.778
That being said, I assume that the goal of my
participation is to ensure Tokiomi Tohsaka's victory,

91
06:31.050 --> 06:32.925
rather than to prevail myself.

92
06:33.151 --> 06:34.644
To achieve that goal

93
06:34.756 --> 06:39.480
we will conduct ourselves in a manner that will
maintain the appearance of us being enemies.

94
06:39.930 --> 06:42.844
However, we will actually be working together

95
06:42.950 --> 06:47.090
in total secrecy to soundly
defeat the other five masters,

96
06:47.365 --> 06:49.748
and assure our victory in the end.

97
06:50.990 --> 06:52.343
And so, Kirei,

98
06:52.903 --> 06:56.912
you will be officially transferred from
the Church to the Mage's Association

99
06:57.449 --> 06:59.299
where you will become my student.

100
07:00.100 --> 07:02.532
The official orders have already been issued.

101
07:02.945 --> 07:06.273
You must go to Japan and study the principles of magic,

102
07:06.692 --> 07:09.658
and become a mage of sufficient strength and skill

103
07:10.146 --> 07:15.087
to command a servant in the Holy Grail War
in three years time when the battles begin.

104
07:19.370 --> 07:20.262
Now then.

105
07:20.580 --> 07:22.783
Do you have any questions for us, Kirei?

106
07:23.170 --> 07:24.472
Only one.

107
07:26.115 --> 07:29.865
How exactly does the Holy Grail
go about selecting its masters?

108
07:29.958 --> 07:32.301
What kind of criteria does it use?

109
07:33.430 --> 07:34.118
Hm.

110
07:35.100 --> 07:40.911
The exact criteria it uses is unknown,
but it chooses those masters who need it most.

111
07:41.207 --> 07:44.813
So all the participating masters
have a reason to covet the Grail?

112
07:45.110 --> 07:46.352
Not necessarily.

113
07:46.897 --> 07:50.354
I'm told that in the past there
were cases where Command Seals

114
07:50.581 --> 07:53.449
appeared on those whom you would never have expected.

115
07:54.620 --> 07:56.636
Oh, I think I understand.

116
07:57.123 --> 08:00.936
You're still puzzled at being chosen to
be a master by the Grail, aren't you?

117
08:04.040 --> 08:07.450
I didn't expect Kirei to give his consent so quickly.

118
08:07.836 --> 08:12.213
My son would jump into fire if the
Holy Church ordered him to do so.

119
08:12.550 --> 08:15.430
To be honest with you, I'm even a little shocked.

120
08:15.754 --> 08:17.306
From his perspective,

121
08:17.400 --> 08:21.693
he's being drawn into a senseless war that
has absolutely nothing to do with him.

122
08:22.676 --> 08:24.529
No, this is as it should be.

123
08:24.876 --> 08:27.243
Perhaps this ordeal will do him some good.

124
08:28.230 --> 08:31.960
Only a few days ago, my son lost his wife.

125
08:32.530 --> 08:37.045
I believe that a complete change of scenery
and a difficult new mission to focus on

126
08:37.182 --> 08:40.246
may be exactly what he needs to nurse his wounds.

127
08:51.473 --> 08:52.642
Hi, Aoi.

128
08:57.760 --> 09:00.198
Kariya, it's good to see you again.

129
09:00.223 --> 09:01.439
You're back from your trip?

130
09:02.041 --> 09:04.359
This one seemed to last a long time.

131
09:04.850 --> 09:06.813
Yeah, I guess it did.

132
09:07.690 --> 09:09.001
Uncle Kariya!

133
09:11.009 --> 09:13.132
Uncle Kariya, welcome back!

134
09:13.740 --> 09:14.906
Hi, Rin.

135
09:15.683 --> 09:17.563
Did you bring me a present again?

136
09:18.120 --> 09:20.867
No, Rin, you're being very rude.

137
09:23.040 --> 09:23.716
Here.

138
09:27.830 --> 09:29.500
Thank you, Uncle Kariya.

139
09:29.712 --> 09:32.566
You are very welcome, Rin, I'm glad you like it.

140
09:36.430 --> 09:37.553
Where's Sakura?

141
09:41.310 --> 09:44.751
Sakura's gone now.

142
09:48.480 --> 09:49.643
What did she mean?

143
09:50.115 --> 09:51.625
Sakura is... 

144
09:51.796 --> 09:55.341
well, she's no longer my
daughter or Rin's little sister.

145
09:57.030 --> 10:01.031
She's now with... the Matou family.

146
10:02.374 --> 10:03.457
But why?

147
10:04.330 --> 10:08.642
The Matous want a child who carries
in them the blood of a mage.

148
10:09.330 --> 10:12.321
You know why, better than anyone else.

149
10:15.484 --> 10:21.875
The head of the Tohsaka family decided to give our
ancient allies, the Matous, that which they requested.

150
10:22.100 --> 10:24.490
It wasn't my place to speak out.

151
10:26.060 --> 10:27.543
You're all right with that?

152
10:28.020 --> 10:30.594
When I married into the Tohsaka family,

153
10:30.840 --> 10:32.947
when I decided to marry a mage,

154
10:33.268 --> 10:35.541
I knew what might be required of me.

155
10:36.400 --> 10:38.022
And you're all right with that?

156
10:38.333 --> 10:45.040
The reality is that a clan bearing mage blood can
never expect to enjoy the happiness of a normal family.

157
10:45.149 --> 10:46.371
That's not true!

158
10:46.698 --> 10:48.886
When you married him you wanted happiness, you wanted... 

159
10:49.033 --> 10:50.148
Enough!

160
10:50.620 --> 10:53.250
This is between the Tohsakas and the Matous.

161
10:53.390 --> 10:56.129
You left the world of mages a long time ago.

162
10:56.688 --> 10:58.075
This doesn't concern you.

163
11:02.784 --> 11:05.415
If you get the chance to see Sakura again,

164
11:05.668 --> 11:07.083
please be kind to her.

165
11:07.890 --> 11:11.584
She was always very fond of you.

166
11:14.753 --> 11:19.646
So, the failure actually had
the nerve to show his face here.

167
11:20.463 --> 11:26.750
I distinctly remember telling you to stay far away
from this house, and to never darken my doorstep again,

168
11:27.317 --> 11:28.143
Kariya.

169
11:28.467 --> 11:31.305
I heard you adopted the Tohsaka's second daughter.

170
11:32.223 --> 11:34.080
Then you have sharp ears.

171
11:34.393 --> 11:39.563
Is it really so important to keep mages in
the Matou lineage that you have to do this?

172
11:39.694 --> 11:41.469
Would you tell me we're wrong to?

173
11:41.563 --> 11:43.147
You of all people?

174
11:43.308 --> 11:48.008
Tell me who's fault do you think it is
for our present reduced circumstances.

175
11:48.493 --> 11:49.379
Kariya,

176
11:49.853 --> 11:52.558
had you only agreed to carry on the family name

177
11:52.597 --> 11:54.743
and to learn the secrets of the Matou,

178
11:54.852 --> 11:56.913
things would never have gotten this bad,

179
11:56.913 --> 11:59.691
and that little girl would still be with her mother.

180
11:59.751 --> 12:02.246
You're not fooling anyone, you vampire.

181
12:02.767 --> 12:05.907
You only want the Grail to give yourself eternal youth.

182
12:06.174 --> 12:07.704
You just wanna live forever.

183
12:10.303 --> 12:14.449
Nearly 60 years have passed since
the last time the masters gathered,

184
12:14.549 --> 12:18.828
but the Matous have no pawns yet to
offer for the fourth Holy Grail War.

185
12:19.088 --> 12:24.787
Though you have it inside you, your brother Byakuya
lacks the power needed to control a servant.

186
12:25.144 --> 12:31.722
But even if we forfeit this round, we could still
win the next in 60 years if we prepare ourselves.

187
12:31.862 --> 12:37.270
The Tohsaka girl's womb will one day bear
us a powerful mage, one who could prevail.

188
12:37.318 --> 12:41.155
She has a lot of potential,
that one, she could be the key.

189
12:41.342 --> 12:45.343
So then in other words,
if you can get your hands on the Grail,

190
12:45.519 --> 12:48.056
you won't need Sakura Tohsaka anymore.

191
12:49.343 --> 12:52.197
What is it you're scheming, Kariya?

192
12:52.763 --> 12:54.480
A trade, Zouken.

193
12:55.235 --> 12:58.986
Next year I will return from the Grail
War, Grail in hand,

194
12:59.733 --> 13:02.871
and in return, you will release Sakura.

195
13:04.443 --> 13:06.273
Don't be a stupid idiot.

196
13:06.372 --> 13:09.443
You're a failure and you haven't
trained a day in your life.

197
13:09.547 --> 13:14.790
You actually believe that in a single year
you'll achieve the power to control a servant?

198
13:15.220 --> 13:21.413
You have the secret magic to make that happen and
you know it, using your special worm techniques.

199
13:24.043 --> 13:24.903
So?

200
13:24.994 --> 13:28.294
You can implant me with your crest worms.

201
13:28.843 --> 13:31.395
Kariya, you want to die?

202
13:31.642 --> 13:34.883
The Matous should rely on
themselves to gain what they want.

203
13:35.237 --> 13:37.152
I won't let anyone else get involved.

204
13:38.566 --> 13:42.568
Surely you're not concerned for my well-being, Father.

205
13:45.093 --> 13:48.448
If what you're trying to do is keep her out of all this,

206
13:48.474 --> 13:53.249
Kariya, I'm afraid you're a little late.

207
13:53.375 --> 13:56.185
You bastard, you didn't!

208
13:59.743 --> 14:04.861
For the first three days in there she did
nothing but constantly scream her head off.

209
14:05.268 --> 14:08.976
But on the fourth, she settled down and finally stopped.

210
14:09.368 --> 14:14.832
Early this morning, I threw her down into
the worm pit to see just how long she'd last.

211
14:15.513 --> 14:20.039
She's been in there for over 12
hours and she's still breathing.

212
14:20.279 --> 14:24.007
The Tohsakas have very powerful inner spirits.

213
14:24.733 --> 14:25.607
Sakura!

214
14:25.632 --> 14:27.194
What will you do now?

215
14:27.567 --> 14:33.668
She's a broken little girl ripped from the life
she knew, and violated by worms from head to toe.

216
14:33.797 --> 14:36.945
But if you still wish to save her from this ordeal,

217
14:37.152 --> 14:39.700
I might be willing to think about it.

218
14:40.000 --> 14:41.107
I agree.

219
14:42.583 --> 14:46.963
But I intend to continue her
education until you show results.

220
14:46.963 --> 14:49.242
That point is not negotiable.

221
14:49.762 --> 14:53.877
I still expect to achieve victory
in the next war 60 years from now,

222
14:53.989 --> 14:59.553
but should you somehow manage to retrieve
the Grail in this war, all the better.

223
14:59.640 --> 15:05.273
Naturally, I'll no longer need the girl.
In that case, her education will only last a year,

224
15:05.376 --> 15:08.696
and then she'll be free to go where she wants.

225
15:09.078 --> 15:11.918
You won't renege on your words, Zouken Matou?

226
15:12.019 --> 15:15.394
You can start by serving as
the breeding ground for a week.

227
15:15.640 --> 15:19.033
If you don't die or go insane then I'll concede that

228
15:19.058 --> 15:22.433
you're actually serious and
will keep my word completely.

229
15:31.423 --> 15:32.553
It's finally here.

230
15:35.303 --> 15:36.348
What does it say?

231
15:36.763 --> 15:40.020
It's a report from the spies I
sent to the London Clock Tower.

232
15:40.455 --> 15:44.401
It says that the Grail chose a
master from within the tower,

233
15:45.018 --> 15:47.392
the headquarters of the Mage's Association.

234
15:47.827 --> 15:48.714
Who is it?

235
15:48.739 --> 15:50.097
A rather big problem.

236
15:50.483 --> 15:52.810
The eldest son of the Archibald family,

237
15:53.036 --> 15:54.562
a ninth generation mage.

238
15:55.095 --> 15:57.842
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

239
16:01.101 --> 16:05.522
In the world of mages,
a long and distinguished lineage is everything.

240
16:05.742 --> 16:07.465
Nothing else matters.

241
16:07.738 --> 16:12.530
This is because magic will not yield
up her secrets in a single generation.

242
16:12.710 --> 16:17.093
A parent passes on the fruits of a
lifetime of magical training to his child.

243
16:17.533 --> 16:22.448
Thus, the older the family of mages,
the greater their power ultimately becomes.

244
16:22.641 --> 16:27.063
You are no doubt wondering why I begin
today's lecture with something so basic.

245
16:27.170 --> 16:32.797
It is because a student from this class
submitted a fascinating paper to me yesterday.

246
16:33.617 --> 16:36.605
"How Wizardry Should Be in the New Century."

247
16:37.351 --> 16:42.201
It attempts to make a case objecting to the
longstanding traditions of which I just spoke.

248
16:42.616 --> 16:46.469
It claims that if one were to achieve
a deep understanding of the techniques

249
16:46.494 --> 16:49.028
and precise control over mana application,

250
16:49.126 --> 16:52.773
it would allow one to overcome any
difference in inherent ability.

251
16:53.386 --> 16:59.067
In short, even someone with diluted blood could,
through his own efforts, become a master mage.

252
16:59.680 --> 17:01.383
To be honest, I've learned something

253
17:01.383 --> 17:02.726
from reading this paper.

254
17:03.513 --> 17:04.969
Silence, please.

255
17:07.263 --> 17:08.883
I will be perfectly frank.

256
17:09.150 --> 17:13.063
This paper is nothing but immature juvenile fantasies.

257
17:13.375 --> 17:13.975
Huh?

258
17:14.102 --> 17:16.944
Blood determines a mage's powers and abilities.

259
17:17.097 --> 17:20.287
This is a hard and unchanging reality of this world.

260
17:21.573 --> 17:23.823
Even for you, Waver Velvet.

261
17:23.999 --> 17:29.586
I am very, very disappointed that one of my
students would indulge in this moronic nonsense.

262
17:29.646 --> 17:34.691
Sir, I was only trying to raise a question the Mage's
Association has become too reluctant to address.

263
17:34.716 --> 17:38.039
Mr. Velvet, if I recall correctly,

264
17:38.306 --> 17:41.554
your family has produced mages
for only three generations.

265
17:41.647 --> 17:42.976
Isn't that right?

266
17:43.249 --> 17:48.128
Listen to me, compared to the Mage's
Association's long and illustrious history,

267
17:48.274 --> 17:51.063
your family is no more than a newborn baby.

268
17:51.236 --> 17:55.578
Don't you think a baby should learn to
speak before it tries to voice an opinion?

269
17:57.250 --> 17:58.549
He made a fool of me,

270
17:58.574 --> 17:59.428
he made a fool of me,

271
17:59.455 --> 18:00.842
he made a fool of me!

272
18:00.903 --> 18:02.701
Is that any way for a teacher to act?

273
18:02.921 --> 18:05.634
Reading my paper made him jealous
and he couldn't handle it!

274
18:05.700 --> 18:07.743
The pompous ass is afraid of my talent.

275
18:07.882 --> 18:10.155
That's why he embarrassed me in front of everyone.

276
18:10.448 --> 18:11.263
Whoa!

277
18:12.818 --> 18:14.220
Oh, I'm sorry.

278
18:14.543 --> 18:15.867
Are you all right?

279
18:16.204 --> 18:17.337
I'm fine.

280
18:18.293 --> 18:20.988
You're in the Spiritual Evocation Department.

281
18:21.049 --> 18:22.705
Why aren't you in class?

282
18:22.730 --> 18:23.763
Well, uh,

283
18:23.849 --> 18:27.028
Mr. Archibald asked me to run an errand for him.

284
18:27.381 --> 18:29.168
That's why I was in a hurry.

285
18:29.893 --> 18:32.023
I see, that's great.

286
18:32.089 --> 18:34.904
Would you mind giving this to
him when you go back to class?

287
18:37.434 --> 18:39.192
Okay, sure, why not?

288
18:39.836 --> 18:42.995
Just make sure he gets it,
it's supposed to be important.

289
18:43.141 --> 18:44.394
It's important?

290
18:45.613 --> 18:48.851
Package origin, Macedonia?

291
18:56.173 --> 18:57.113
This is it.

292
18:58.003 --> 19:00.096
So it seems that all the rumors about that

293
19:00.121 --> 19:05.806
bastard Kayneth Archibald preparing to fight in some
kind of mages tournament in the Far East soon are true.

294
19:10.893 --> 19:12.591
The Holy Grail War.

295
19:13.273 --> 19:18.693
According to the legend, 200 years ago,
the Einzberns, the Makiris, and the Tohsakas,

296
19:18.800 --> 19:21.323
collectively known as the three first families,

297
19:21.471 --> 19:23.823
worked together to summon the Holy Grail,

298
19:23.876 --> 19:27.763
said to have the power to grant any
wish, and eventually succeeded it.

299
19:28.613 --> 19:34.033
But the Holy Grail would only grant
one of the family's supplications.

300
19:34.873 --> 19:39.625
Their cooperation quickly turned
to violent and bloody conflict.

301
19:39.793 --> 19:42.820
That was the beginning of the Holy Grail Wars.

302
19:43.173 --> 19:46.152
Ever since then, once every 60 years,

303
19:46.225 --> 19:48.762
the Holy Grail appears in the city of Fuyuki.

304
19:48.955 --> 19:53.974
It selects seven mages from across the globe
to compete for it, and grants them powers.

305
19:54.473 --> 19:58.788
Each magically summons a heroic
spirit known as a servant.

306
20:00.313 --> 20:05.903
Archer, Saber, Lancer, Rider, Assassin,

307
20:05.903 --> 20:08.085
Caster, Berserker.

308
20:09.033 --> 20:14.161
Divided into these seven classes of warriors,
the servants, guided by their masters,

309
20:14.241 --> 20:19.900
fight each other to the death in secret battles
to determine who is worthy to win the Grail.

310
20:23.367 --> 20:25.750
So it appears that this Grail War

311
20:25.853 --> 20:31.193
is a battle of pure strength where stupid
titles and influence mean absolutely nothing.

312
20:32.034 --> 20:34.618
That looks like it's the perfect place for me.

313
20:36.643 --> 20:42.927
Wait, in order to summon a servant some kind of
relic related to them is needed to act as a catalyst.

314
20:44.113 --> 20:45.409
A relic.

315
21:15.779 --> 21:18.878
That device always strikes me as being indecent.

316
21:19.449 --> 21:21.438
There's a report from the Clock Tower.

317
21:21.699 --> 21:25.309
It looks like Lord El‐Melloi has acquired another relic.

318
21:26.079 --> 21:29.006
His participation in the war is certain now.

319
21:29.459 --> 21:33.183
It troubles me that two of the
slots are still unaccounted for.

320
21:33.410 --> 21:38.089
Don't worry, when the time comes,
the Grail will select seven, regardless of skill.

321
21:38.131 --> 21:40.549
The ones it selects to round out the group are... 

322
21:40.629 --> 21:43.259
well, often weak and inexperienced.

323
21:43.446 --> 21:44.813
Don't concern yourself.

324
21:45.360 --> 21:47.893
Speaking of matters of real concern, Kirei,

325
21:48.086 --> 21:51.374
I trust that no one followed you
or saw you enter this mansion.

326
21:51.399 --> 21:52.672
No, don't worry.

327
21:53.149 --> 21:58.621
No familiars or devices, visible or invisible,
are watching me or this mansion right now.

328
21:59.279 --> 22:00.248
On that

329
22:00.273 --> 22:02.658
You have my guarantee.

330
22:02.819 --> 22:08.862
No matter what tricks or deception they
use, no one can deceive the eyes of Hassan,

331
22:09.119 --> 22:11.122
the spy heroic spirit.

332
22:11.459 --> 22:16.226
There is no trace of anyone following
my master or watching this house.

333
22:16.629 --> 22:19.473
Please, you can put your mind at ease.

334
22:20.129 --> 22:23.217
If a servant has been manifested by another master

335
22:23.383 --> 22:25.687
my father is certain to be aware of it.

336
22:26.309 --> 22:28.326
The other mages will not take action,

337
22:28.519 --> 22:30.559
at least for a little while longer.

338
22:31.431 --> 22:35.293
Assassin, you may go,
continue guarding the surrounding area.

339
22:36.019 --> 22:37.479
As you wish.

340
22:39.029 --> 22:41.831
It's only a matter of time before that changes.

341
22:42.029 --> 22:48.898
Very soon now this place will be swarming with familiars
and magical devices sent by other masters to spy on me.

342
22:49.659 --> 22:50.699
What is that?

343
22:50.724 --> 22:52.491
Another investigation.

344
22:53.031 --> 22:57.231
I've been gathering what information
I can on the Einzbern master.

345
22:58.249 --> 23:03.309
Nine years ago, the Einzberns,
a family notoriously proud of their pure blood,

346
23:03.516 --> 23:07.150
suddenly allowed an outsider
mage to marry into the family.

347
23:10.349 --> 23:13.859
The Einzbern mages have devoted
themselves solely to alchemy,

348
23:14.019 --> 23:16.299
rendering them unfit for combat.

349
23:16.678 --> 23:20.646
Their losses in previous Grail Wars
can all be traced to that fact.

350
23:21.069 --> 23:23.725
They must have finally run out of patience.

351
23:24.909 --> 23:28.711
The man they chose was perfect for their needs.

352
23:31.869 --> 23:37.308
Kiritsugu Emiya, the man known as the Mage Killer.

353
23:43.259 --> 23:49.049
We finally found the relic we've been
searching for in Cornwall all these years.

354
23:49.242 --> 23:53.035
If you use it as a catalyst you'll be
able to summon what is widely considered

355
23:53.060 --> 23:56.604
the strongest of all known sword‐wielding servants.

356
23:57.380 --> 23:58.367
Kiritsugu,

357
23:58.607 --> 24:04.279
this is the greatest gift the Einzbern can offer
to the man who is working in service to our needs.

358
24:04.316 --> 24:06.483
Thank you, Elder, I am honored.

359
24:07.009 --> 24:10.242
This time there are to be no survivors.

360
24:10.509 --> 24:13.862
You are to hunt down the six
other servants and eliminate them,

361
24:13.887 --> 24:17.012
and fulfill the third magic, Heaven's Feel.

362
24:17.663 --> 24:18.671
Yes, sir.

363
24:20.289 --> 24:22.013
Kiritsugu Emiya?

364
24:22.799 --> 24:24.805
Yes, I know that name.

365
24:25.319 --> 24:29.004
So, even the Holy Church has heard of this man.

366
24:30.259 --> 24:34.424
Kiritsugu Emiya, the Mage Killer,
was quite infamous in his time.

367
24:34.979 --> 24:38.825
Officially, he was a rogue mage who
didn't belong to the Association,

368
24:39.025 --> 24:43.870
but the higher ups found him, shall we
say, convenient for their own purposes.

369
24:43.970 --> 24:46.624
It sounds to me like he was quite similar to us.

370
24:46.649 --> 24:48.764
Executioners for the Holy Church.

371
24:49.069 --> 24:50.724
Far worse, I assure you.

372
24:50.986 --> 24:54.196
He spent his life as a freelance master assassin

373
24:54.343 --> 24:56.964
who specializes in exterminating mages.

374
24:57.299 --> 25:03.278
He knows what mages are capable of, so he deals with
them in a way that is unlike a mage as possible.

375
25:04.871 --> 25:05.972
Read that.

376
25:07.669 --> 25:12.209
Sniping, poisoning, bombs in public places.

377
25:12.735 --> 25:14.889
He once brought down an entire jetliner

378
25:14.889 --> 25:16.747
just because his target was on it.

379
25:17.849 --> 25:21.189
A man who will do anything without a second thought.

380
25:22.979 --> 25:26.865
It is because mages function outside
the laws of the regular world

381
25:27.025 --> 25:31.535
that we must diligently obey the strict
laws that we have set for ourselves.

382
25:31.869 --> 25:36.554
But this man lacks even a single
trace of a mage's pride or honor.

383
25:37.475 --> 25:40.257
The methods he employs are unforgivable.

384
25:41.348 --> 25:45.991
Then tell me, what does this Kiritsugu Emiya gain...

385
25:47.493 --> 25:49.976
by hiring himself out as a killer?

386
25:50.429 --> 25:51.922
Money, I would imagine.

387
25:53.049 --> 25:54.844
As you can read in that report,

388
25:55.389 --> 25:58.845
he's been involved in more
than just mage assassinations.

389
25:59.729 --> 26:05.596
He's appeared in war zones all over the
planet offering his services as a mercenary.

390
26:06.780 --> 26:07.864
I see.

391
26:08.899 --> 26:11.363
May I borrow this for a while?

392
26:16.989 --> 26:19.771
Let's go over what we know, Iri, all right?

393
26:21.039 --> 26:25.672
Of the seven masters that the Grail will
choose we have identified four of them.

394
26:26.589 --> 26:29.778
Tokiomi Tohsaka, Tohsaka family head.

395
26:29.879 --> 26:33.317
Fire mage, uses jewel magic, very formidable.

396
26:34.140 --> 26:35.711
Kariya Matou.

397
26:36.889 --> 26:38.599
So they took the kid who left the family

398
26:38.599 --> 26:40.014
and made him a master, huh?

399
26:40.769 --> 26:42.376
That old man must be desperate.

400
26:43.769 --> 26:46.050
Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald.

401
26:46.859 --> 26:48.292
Wind and water affinity.

402
26:48.979 --> 26:52.953
He's a top expert in necromancy, summoning, and alchemy.

403
26:53.659 --> 26:54.604
And next... 

404
26:54.629 --> 26:56.091
Kiritsugu Emiya.

405
26:56.491 --> 27:02.387
Newest member of the Einzbern family and
their trump card, and the man that I love.

406
27:04.822 --> 27:08.570
And the fourth master...  no, I mean the fifth one,

407
27:08.959 --> 27:10.940
is representing the Holy Church.

408
27:11.259 --> 27:12.775
His name is Kirei Kotomine.

409
27:13.589 --> 27:14.884
He's from the Church?

410
27:15.389 --> 27:18.860
He's the son of the overseer, Father Risei Kotomine.

411
27:19.389 --> 27:23.468
Reports say he studied under Tokiomi
Tohsaka starting three years ago,

412
27:23.641 --> 27:26.069
splitting with him after his Command Seal appeared.

413
27:26.769 --> 27:28.156
Did something happen?

414
27:28.519 --> 27:30.204
This is his personal history.

415
27:31.819 --> 27:33.248
Read it for yourself.

416
27:34.819 --> 27:39.981
Kirei Kotomine followed his father on
pilgrimages around the world since childhood,

417
27:40.094 --> 27:43.460
graduated from the St.
Ignatius School of Divinity in Manresa,

418
27:43.579 --> 27:46.586
skipped two years, graduated valedictorian.

419
27:46.984 --> 27:48.603
He sounds pretty impressive.

420
27:48.919 --> 27:53.972
But then suddenly, he leaves the primrose
path and volunteers for the Holy Church.

421
27:54.312 --> 27:58.782
Why would someone like that decide to
work for a secret Church organization?

422
27:59.349 --> 28:00.884
Maybe because of his father?

423
28:01.349 --> 28:06.137
It says here that Kotomine is a member of
the Holy Church's Eighth Sacrament Assembly.

424
28:06.729 --> 28:09.431
Then he would've pursued that
path from the very beginning.

425
28:10.069 --> 28:16.007
But until he arrived at the same place as his
father, he changed positions three times.

426
28:16.449 --> 28:19.062
At one time he was even an inquisitor.

427
28:20.079 --> 28:21.298
An inquisitor?

428
28:21.905 --> 28:23.465
A heretic hunter.

429
28:24.329 --> 28:27.604
In essence, exactly what I was.

430
28:27.897 --> 28:29.819
A ruthless mage killer.

431
28:30.832 --> 28:32.439
Kiritsugu Emiya.

432
28:33.129 --> 28:38.450
His assassinations were always carried out in
clusters over a relatively short period of time.

433
28:39.009 --> 28:43.330
During the same general time periods,
he appeared in a number of war zones,

434
28:43.504 --> 28:46.005
but only when the combat was at its fiercest.

435
28:46.292 --> 28:50.099
It was almost as if he had some
obsession with chasing his own death.

436
28:50.559 --> 28:54.098
These were clearly the actions of a man bent on suicide.

437
28:56.779 --> 28:58.793
So then why is he doing this?

438
28:59.449 --> 29:03.140
Alchemy, necromancy, summoning, divination, healing.

439
29:03.619 --> 29:07.548
Interesting, look at all the
categories of magic he studied.

440
29:07.894 --> 29:09.703
Why did he try to study so many?

441
29:09.999 --> 29:12.634
He gets almost to the point of mastery of a discipline,

442
29:13.089 --> 29:16.572
then switches to another field,
and never looks back again.

443
29:17.072 --> 29:22.068
It's... it's as if he throws away everything
he's learned like yesterday's trash.

444
29:23.356 --> 29:28.384
Iri, this man, Kirei Kotomine, terrifies me.

445
29:28.979 --> 29:31.645
He has no concept of self interest.

446
29:31.739 --> 29:36.762
His actions are completely disconnected
from any thought of risk versus reward.

447
29:37.109 --> 29:41.207
No way, there's no way he's just
a freelancer in it for the money.

448
29:41.381 --> 29:45.119
He's never shown any passion
for anything at all in his life.

449
29:45.489 --> 29:47.716
He believes in absolutely nothing.

450
29:48.459 --> 29:52.547
He has no deep desire,
no wish of any kind to be granted.

451
29:53.499 --> 29:54.774
A man like that... 

452
29:55.008 --> 29:57.718
Then what is he after?

453
29:58.065 --> 30:01.639
Why would he put his life at risk to get the Holy Grail?

454
30:02.009 --> 30:07.164
But the Grail chose him to be one
of its seven masters for this war.

455
30:07.349 --> 30:12.594
You're right, he must have some reason
we don't know about to want the Grail.

456
30:13.109 --> 30:19.403
But I can't even begin to imagine what it
is, and that terrifies me.

457
30:21.840 --> 30:23.479
Kirei Kotomine.

458
30:23.943 --> 30:25.883
Kiritsugu Emiya.

459
30:26.354 --> 30:32.826
His endless string of battles came to a sudden halt
nine years ago, and he virtually vanished from sight.

460
30:33.289 --> 30:36.362
It appears that his final encounter
with the mages of the North,

461
30:36.387 --> 30:39.374
the Einzberns, is where he at last found his answer.

462
30:40.009 --> 30:42.785
So, I must ask the question,

463
30:43.299 --> 30:45.262
what did he seek in those battles?

464
30:45.509 --> 30:47.259
What was he looking for?

465
30:47.641 --> 30:50.091
And what exactly did he find?

466
31:01.055 --> 31:04.225
Well, you just barely made it.

467
31:04.481 --> 31:11.039
If the Grail has chosen you, that must mean that
you've made at least some progress as a mage.

468
31:11.568 --> 31:13.772
I'll give you that much, Kariya.

469
31:15.587 --> 31:16.930
But look at you.

470
31:17.170 --> 31:19.550
You look like bloody hell.

471
31:20.383 --> 31:23.989
Is your left leg working all right, eh?

472
31:32.552 --> 31:39.009
Now don't get angry, you know if you get the crest worms
inside you worked up too much they'll simply devour you.

473
31:40.214 --> 31:46.115
Either way, I'd give you perhaps a month at best before
they do their damage and drain the life out of you.

474
31:47.337 --> 31:48.564
That's plenty.

475
31:48.870 --> 31:49.945
What did you say?

476
31:50.114 --> 31:52.858
I said that that will be plenty of time.

477
31:53.865 --> 31:58.167
Kariya, this is your present
for surviving an entire year.

478
31:58.460 --> 32:00.408
I found the perfect relic for you.

479
32:01.356 --> 32:05.185
Don't let your loving father's kindness go to waste.

480
32:16.425 --> 32:19.325
I did it, I've got a Command Seal too!

481
32:19.631 --> 32:21.845
The Grail chose me as a master!

482
32:22.193 --> 32:25.711
My incredible talent has been recognized by the Grail!

483
32:28.262 --> 32:29.595
I can't just sit here.

484
32:30.154 --> 32:32.474
I have to prepare to summon my servant.

485
32:36.275 --> 32:39.088
Mikina Nishimoto, the missing sixth grade girl from... 

486
32:39.195 --> 32:40.462
Good morning, Waver.

487
32:40.487 --> 32:44.193
Good morning, dear. How did you sleep?

488
32:44.325 --> 32:47.948
Morning, Grandpa and Grandma.

489
32:48.886 --> 32:50.681
Fuyuki's getting bad these days.

490
32:50.755 --> 32:52.795
Yes, it really is.

491
32:52.988 --> 32:55.045
By the way, Martha, it's very strange.

492
32:55.254 --> 32:59.177
I've heard roosters making a big racket
since the sun came up this morning.

493
32:59.677 --> 33:01.150
What's that all about?

494
33:01.432 --> 33:04.685
It's because there are three roosters in our yard.

495
33:04.983 --> 33:06.293
What're they doing there?

496
33:06.389 --> 33:07.629
I don't know.

497
33:07.749 --> 33:10.368
I've been wondering where they might've come from.

498
33:10.855 --> 33:13.321
Oh, sweetie, you want some coffee?

499
33:13.895 --> 33:14.935
Mhm.

500
33:15.062 --> 33:16.025
Waver.

501
33:16.202 --> 33:18.061
What happened to your hand?

502
33:18.742 --> 33:19.610
Crap.

503
33:19.837 --> 33:20.979
That mark.

504
33:21.115 --> 33:21.972
What mark?

505
33:22.079 --> 33:25.098
You didn't have that mark on your hand yesterday.

506
33:25.418 --> 33:27.157
Ah, bugger!

507
33:27.584 --> 33:30.031
I really wish you hadn't noticed that.

508
33:30.431 --> 33:31.964
What's wrong, Waver?

509
33:32.090 --> 33:33.465
What is it, dear?

510
33:33.611 --> 33:36.670
Nothing's wrong, here, have some coffee.

511
33:37.034 --> 33:38.907
I put lots of milk in it.

512
33:39.385 --> 33:42.813
You two like coffee, right?

513
33:43.725 --> 33:47.975
They were all stabbed using a
similar, if not identical, weapon.

514
33:50.315 --> 33:51.870
What a pain in the ass.

515
33:51.963 --> 33:58.086
Do I have to start their hypnosis all over again,
starting from me being their grandson back from abroad?

516
34:02.075 --> 34:05.882
I need to think of a cover story
for those roosters I stole too.

517
34:07.194 --> 34:10.882
I can't believe they really found
the legendary Excalibur's scabbard.

518
34:11.574 --> 34:13.322
There's not a scratch on it.

519
34:14.124 --> 34:16.547
Is this thing really 1,500 years old?

520
34:17.164 --> 34:20.137
The object itself is a type of conceptual weapon.

521
34:20.417 --> 34:24.116
It doesn't rust or degrade as
ordinary physical objects do.

522
34:24.384 --> 34:31.037
Just like in the legend surrounding its existence,
it heals its owner's wounds and halts the aging process.

523
34:31.687 --> 34:35.538
Of course, that's only when supplied
with its original owner's mana.

524
34:36.064 --> 34:40.267
In other words, the master can use this
in tandem with the summoned heroic spirit

525
34:40.734 --> 34:43.046
to protect himself during the course of a battle.

526
34:43.226 --> 34:44.701
That's just like you.

527
34:45.234 --> 34:47.969
What you're saying is that a tool is just a tool?

528
34:48.129 --> 34:51.173
That's right, I am, and that goes for the servant too.

529
34:51.679 --> 34:55.578
No matter how famous the heroic spirit,
when summoned as a servant they're nothing

530
34:55.986 --> 34:57.760
but a tool for their master.

531
34:58.692 --> 35:01.327
Anyone who lets their fantasies get the better of them

532
35:01.554 --> 35:04.222
will never have the wherewithal to win this battle.

533
35:04.583 --> 35:07.818
And because you're the way you
are, my great‐grandfather decided

534
35:08.053 --> 35:10.542
this scabbard was the perfect relic for you.

535
35:11.003 --> 35:12.272
What do you think?

536
35:13.594 --> 35:15.849
Does his gift not satisfy you?

537
35:16.314 --> 35:17.604
Of course it does.

538
35:18.104 --> 35:19.573
Acht did a wonderful job.

539
35:20.024 --> 35:22.908
None of the other masters have something this powerful.

540
35:23.604 --> 35:25.018
What's wrong with it then?

541
35:25.564 --> 35:28.802
Given how perfectly the ancient
relic is connected to it,

542
35:29.212 --> 35:31.914
the heroic spirit, the one we're after,

543
35:32.154 --> 35:34.264
will surely respond to the summons,

544
35:34.954 --> 35:38.290
the King of Knights, Arthur Pendragon.

545
35:39.204 --> 35:42.437
My own compatibility with him is a secondary concern.

546
35:43.465 --> 35:45.938
But Arthur, the wielder of Excalibur,

547
35:45.963 --> 35:49.711
is sure to be the strongest Saber class
servant the Grail Wars have ever seen.

548
35:50.344 --> 35:51.445
That's true.

549
35:51.804 --> 35:54.882
I'll have a servant far stronger
than any other in the battle.

550
35:55.594 --> 35:59.017
The question is, how best to use that power?

551
35:59.224 --> 36:00.920
How to make it work for us?

552
36:01.509 --> 36:04.371
To be honest, in terms of ease of use,

553
36:04.654 --> 36:09.002
Caster or Assassin would be far better
suited to the way I usually fight.

554
36:09.639 --> 36:13.268
What good will it do to worry about
that before you've even summoned him?

555
36:13.574 --> 36:16.780
After all, we don't know what
the King of Knights was like,

556
36:17.584 --> 36:20.770
and besides, no matter what your strategy is,

557
36:21.124 --> 36:24.374
once he learns of your ideals, of your dream,

558
36:24.794 --> 36:27.697
he'll understand, I know he will.

559
36:30.067 --> 36:31.227
Just like I did.

560
36:36.657 --> 36:37.644
What is it?

561
36:38.169 --> 36:41.970
I've found my strategy, the way to get the best use.

562
36:43.590 --> 36:46.419
From the strongest servant fighting in the battle.

563
36:54.481 --> 36:56.108
Hello, Rin.

564
36:58.263 --> 36:59.950
Oh hello, Kirei.

565
37:00.303 --> 37:01.283
Heading out?

566
37:01.461 --> 37:03.503
That's some heavy luggage you have there.

567
37:03.944 --> 37:08.104
That's right, I have to go live
with the Zenjou family for a while.

568
37:10.033 --> 37:14.604
You're staying to fight alongside my
father in a coming war, aren't you?

569
37:14.823 --> 37:18.592
That's why I'm here as his student,
to help him and to learn from him.

570
37:20.293 --> 37:23.462
Kirei, can I depend on you?

571
37:23.623 --> 37:24.215
Huh?

572
37:24.852 --> 37:27.509
Will you promise to protect my father to the end?

573
37:27.698 --> 37:29.577
Will you promise to keep him safe?

574
37:29.691 --> 37:31.777
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

575
37:32.093 --> 37:36.233
If this battle were going to be simple enough
that I could honestly make that promise,

576
37:36.433 --> 37:40.561
we wouldn't have to send you or your mother
away from here to keep you safe and sound.

577
37:43.483 --> 37:47.153
I guess that means I just can't like you no matter what.

578
37:47.305 --> 37:51.015
Rin, you shouldn't just blurt out
what you're really thinking like that.

579
37:51.193 --> 37:54.150
People might start to cast aspersions on your father.

580
37:54.363 --> 37:56.741
He is the man who's educating you after all.

581
37:56.823 --> 37:58.929
My father has nothing to do with it!

582
37:59.033 --> 38:04.356
Listen, Kirei, if you somehow get sloppy and
because of that my father gets hurt or worse,

583
38:04.413 --> 38:06.658
I'll show you no mercy, got it?

584
38:06.873 --> 38:10.700
Rin, what're you doing out there?
How come you're yelling at him?

585
38:11.422 --> 38:15.057
Um, I... Well, you see... 

586
38:15.130 --> 38:19.932
Oh, she was just giving me a bit of
encouragement before we said goodbye, ma'am.

587
38:20.284 --> 38:21.917
Rin, allow me.

588
38:22.063 --> 38:25.095
That big suitcase is far too
heavy for you to carry alone.

589
38:25.308 --> 38:28.132
No thank you, I'll carry it myself.

590
38:28.380 --> 38:32.008
Kirei, do your best to take care of my husband.

591
38:32.403 --> 38:34.996
Please help him to achieve his desire.

592
38:35.403 --> 38:36.965
I will do my best.

593
38:37.225 --> 38:38.431
Please, don't worry.

594
38:41.934 --> 38:43.474
Excuse me.

595
38:44.346 --> 38:50.225
You've arrived at a very opportune time. The relic I
made arrangements for finally arrived this morning.

596
38:50.403 --> 38:51.692
Have a look.

597
38:53.077 --> 38:54.473
What is it?

598
38:55.337 --> 39:00.558
A fossil of the very first skin
shed by a snake on this world.

599
39:01.444 --> 39:06.805
If we use it as a catalyst and are lucky enough
to summon the heroic spirit that we're after,

600
39:06.972 --> 39:09.758
total victory is as good as ours.

601
39:15.567 --> 39:17.726
Hey, Sakura.

602
39:17.937 --> 39:19.786
Did I startle you?

603
39:20.122 --> 39:22.651
Yeah, your face is... 

604
39:22.738 --> 39:23.651
I know.

605
39:24.122 --> 39:27.596
Seems I lost a little bit of it
to the worms that are inside me.

606
39:28.609 --> 39:32.350
I guess I'm just not quite as tough as you are.

607
39:33.884 --> 39:38.451
Uncle Kariya, you're turning into
a different person, aren't you?

608
39:40.167 --> 39:42.068
Yeah, maybe.

609
39:42.785 --> 39:46.655
You know, I don't have to go
to the worm pit again tonight.

610
39:47.224 --> 39:51.248
Grandfather said there will be a more
important ceremony that I have to attend.

611
39:51.287 --> 39:52.634
Yeah, I know.

612
39:53.171 --> 39:56.172
That's why I'm going to the
basement tonight instead of you.

613
39:56.646 --> 40:00.158
Uncle Kariya, are you going somewhere far away?

614
40:00.291 --> 40:04.361
Well, I have an important job
that I need to do for a while.

615
40:04.803 --> 40:10.235
I might not have much time to talk to you
then, at least until I get back.

616
40:11.532 --> 40:12.765
I see.

617
40:13.405 --> 40:14.771
Hey, Sakura.

618
40:15.262 --> 40:19.437
When my job is finally over,
you wanna go somewhere and just have fun?

619
40:19.730 --> 40:21.613
With your mom and your sister too.

620
40:22.930 --> 40:27.263
I don't have anyone I can call Mom or Sister.

621
40:27.994 --> 40:30.435
Grandfather said that I should just think of them

622
40:30.742 --> 40:32.706
like they never existed.

623
40:34.963 --> 40:36.063
I see.

624
40:46.130 --> 40:47.024
Uncle?

625
40:47.370 --> 40:48.497
All right then.

626
40:48.763 --> 40:52.947
When this is all over let's take
Aoi and Rin from the Tohsakas

627
40:53.349 --> 40:56.152
and go somewhere as far away
from this place as we can get.

628
40:56.712 --> 41:00.535
We can hang out and have fun like we used to.

629
41:01.135 --> 41:04.132
Does that mean we'll see them again?

630
41:04.430 --> 41:06.410
Yeah, you will.

631
41:07.371 --> 41:08.987
You have my word on that.

632
41:14.017 --> 41:15.105
All right.

633
41:16.013 --> 41:17.875
I have to get going now.

634
41:18.400 --> 41:19.239
Mhm.

635
41:20.548 --> 41:22.527
Bye‐bye, Uncle Kariya.

636
41:27.157 --> 41:28.478
Bye‐bye.

637
41:30.106 --> 41:33.628
I assume you've memorized the summoning spell correctly?

638
41:33.963 --> 41:34.943
Sure.

639
41:35.130 --> 41:36.176
Very well.

640
41:36.503 --> 41:40.801
But I'm going to have to add two
extra lines to the basic incantation.

641
41:41.221 --> 41:42.612
What do you mean?

642
41:42.832 --> 41:44.778
It's really quite simple, Kariya.

643
41:45.112 --> 41:47.239
Because of your short time in training,

644
41:47.264 --> 41:52.434
your rank as a mage is somewhat lower than that
of the other masters that the Grail has summoned.

645
41:53.176 --> 41:55.808
That will affect the servant's base abilities.

646
41:56.082 --> 41:59.209
This means we have to boost the servant's parameters

647
41:59.234 --> 42:03.017
by attempting to modify the
servant's class as much as possible.

648
42:04.428 --> 42:11.155
Kariya, to that end, I want you to add the
affinity insanity to the servant you summon today.

649
42:13.237 --> 42:15.776
Fill, fill, fill, fill, fill.

650
42:16.709 --> 42:21.235
Repeat five times, but when each is filled, destroy it.

651
42:22.589 --> 42:27.574
For the elements silver and iron,
the foundation stone and the Archduke of Pacts,

652
42:27.687 --> 42:30.637
and for my great master, Schenewerk,

653
42:30.993 --> 42:34.252
raise a wall against the wind and
close the gates of four directions.

654
42:34.305 --> 42:39.033
Come forth from the crown and follow
the forked road leading to the kingdom.

655
42:40.177 --> 42:44.800
Is a simple ritual like this really
enough to summon a heroic spirit?

656
42:45.020 --> 42:46.800
Surprisingly, yes.

657
42:48.101 --> 42:52.796
You see, the summoning ritual doesn't
require a big elaborate evocation.

658
42:53.243 --> 42:56.659
The actual summoning is preformed by the Grail itself.

659
42:57.067 --> 42:58.847
My job as a master is to firmly anchor

660
42:59.173 --> 43:02.140
the heroic spirit in this world and to supply it

661
43:02.366 --> 43:05.519
with enough mana to take physical form.

662
43:06.457 --> 43:07.869
That should do it.

663
43:08.982 --> 43:11.722
Iri, put the relic on the altar.

664
43:12.337 --> 43:14.381
That is the final step.

665
43:15.257 --> 43:20.977
Heed my words, my will creates your
body, and your sword creates my destiny.

666
43:21.370 --> 43:27.148
If you heed the Grail's call and obey my
will and reason, then answer my summoning!

667
43:27.727 --> 43:32.049
I hereby swear that I shall
be all the good in the world,

668
43:32.737 --> 43:36.314
that I shall defeat all evil in the world.

669
43:36.761 --> 43:40.907
Then let thine eyes be clouded
with the fog of turmoil and chaos.

670
43:41.237 --> 43:47.069
Thou who art trapped in a cage of madness,
and I the summoner who holds thy chains!

671
43:47.094 --> 43:50.376
Seventh heaven clad in the great words of power,

672
43:50.799 --> 43:52.916
come forth from this circle of binding,

673
43:52.982 --> 43:54.866
Guardian of Scales!

674
44:26.478 --> 44:28.032
Behold him, Kirei.

675
44:28.377 --> 44:30.038
We have won the battle.

676
44:31.446 --> 44:33.053
Victory is ours!

677
44:40.427 --> 44:41.761
Impossible.

678
44:42.927 --> 44:44.163
I ask you...

679
44:50.345 --> 44:53.492
Are you worthy to be my master?
