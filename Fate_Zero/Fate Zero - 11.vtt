00:33.465 --> 00:34.449
Irisviel.

2
00:37.841 --> 00:38.873
Are you all right?

3
00:39.660 --> 00:41.520
They waited for Kiritsugu to leave

4
00:41.805 --> 00:43.933
before launching a frontal assault.

5
00:44.355 --> 00:48.599
That sudden lightning and that
unscrupulous appearance of his.

6
00:49.174 --> 00:50.082
The enemy.

7
00:51.025 --> 00:52.453
His likely Rider.

8
02:26.481 --> 02:28.161
Whoa!

9
02:33.941 --> 02:34.888
Huh?

10
02:35.488 --> 02:36.854
Hello, Saber.

11
02:40.199 --> 02:41.179
Rider?

12
02:41.666 --> 02:43.861
I came because I wanted to see your castle.

13
02:45.440 --> 02:48.524
It's kind of gloomy here, don't you think, hmm?

14
02:49.304 --> 02:51.012
And what's with the tasteless armor?

15
02:51.365 --> 02:53.380
Are you going out to fight someone right now?

16
02:54.162 --> 02:57.639
Why aren't you wearing your
fashionable clothes like I am tonight?

17
02:58.036 --> 02:58.583
Rider.

18
02:59.007 --> 03:00.303
What are you doing here?

19
03:01.010 --> 03:02.689
You mean you can't tell?

20
03:04.866 --> 03:08.074
I've come to drink, what else does
it look like I've come here to do?

21
03:08.421 --> 03:11.927
So stop standing there like statue
and show me around this place.

22
03:13.041 --> 03:15.921
Surely you have a garden here suitable for a banquet.

23
03:16.638 --> 03:19.927
Honestly, this castle is far too dusty to be in.

24
03:36.780 --> 03:40.847
The Grail is said to be fated for the
hands of the one most worthy to possess it.

25
03:41.695 --> 03:44.337
And the epic battle taking place here in Fuyuki

26
03:44.523 --> 03:47.070
will determine exactly who that person is.

27
03:47.705 --> 03:52.395
And if it's simply a means to decide that
fact, there's hardly a need for bloodshed.

28
03:52.921 --> 03:57.333
After all, if the heroic spirits
can agree on our rankings,

29
03:58.033 --> 04:00.419
then the matter can simply settle itself.

30
04:09.747 --> 04:10.598
Oh.

31
04:12.222 --> 04:16.852
Then I assume you wish to compare
your rank against my own, Rider.

32
04:17.957 --> 04:19.065
Indeed I do.

33
04:19.342 --> 04:23.547
As one who also claims the title of king,
you can not refuse this opportunity.

34
04:23.879 --> 04:27.498
You might consider this a Grail
dialog, rather than a Grail War.

35
04:27.904 --> 04:31.718
And the matter of who among us who is
most suited to claim the Holy Grail

36
04:34.253 --> 04:37.692
will become clear to us as we
drink our fill and converse.

37
04:40.567 --> 04:43.966
I believe that is quite enough nonsense.

38
04:44.819 --> 04:46.536
You mongrels.

39
04:48.527 --> 04:50.462
Archer, what are you doing here?

40
04:50.828 --> 04:52.219
Ah, yes, well,

41
04:52.501 --> 04:56.905
I saw him in town so I thought I might as
well invite him to our little gathering.

42
04:57.551 --> 04:59.987
You're a little late don't you think, goldie,

43
05:00.073 --> 05:03.724
though it stands to reason since
you traveled by foot unlike myself.

44
05:03.985 --> 05:08.742
You actually chose to hold a banquet of
kings in a depressing place like this?

45
05:08.969 --> 05:12.419
How will you recompense me for
the rudeness of calling me here?

46
05:12.906 --> 05:15.212
Oh, why don't you just relax yourself.

47
05:16.107 --> 05:17.820
Here, start with a little drink.

48
05:27.121 --> 05:28.901
What is this disgusting swill?

49
05:29.309 --> 05:33.186
You really thought we could discern a
hierarchy of heroic spirits with this?

50
05:33.613 --> 05:34.748
You don't like it?

51
05:35.301 --> 05:39.167
This cask was among the very best I could
find at the city marketplace this afternoon.

52
05:39.540 --> 05:42.095
You are pitifully ignorant of true drink.

53
05:42.602 --> 05:44.137
Of course you believe that.

54
05:44.377 --> 05:46.123
Stupid mongrel.

55
05:54.427 --> 05:55.235
Ah!

56
05:55.517 --> 05:58.341
Now behold and acknowledge your folly.

57
05:58.527 --> 06:00.702
This is the beverage of a true king.

58
06:01.949 --> 06:03.588
A fine treasure, indeed.

59
06:07.407 --> 06:08.827
Aaahhh.

60
06:15.820 --> 06:17.900
Ah, magnificent.

61
06:19.556 --> 06:24.349
My treasury houses only the very finest
of drinks and the finest of swords.

62
06:28.154 --> 06:32.402
This alone should indicate which
among us is the greatest of kings.

63
06:33.293 --> 06:38.849
Archer, your finest drink is indeed worthy
of the finest vessel in all of history.

64
06:39.438 --> 06:42.227
But the Holy Grail is not a drinking cup.

65
06:42.634 --> 06:44.774
First, we must hear what wish
you would have the Grail grant

66
06:44.804 --> 06:45.974
should you win it.

67
06:46.433 --> 06:49.028
The wish is what gives the Grail its purpose.

68
06:49.428 --> 06:51.117
You are not ruler here, mongrel.

69
06:51.410 --> 06:54.591
Already you wantonly disregard
the time honored rules

70
06:54.664 --> 06:56.750
which dictate we fight for the Grail.

71
06:57.490 --> 06:58.105
Hmm?

72
06:58.745 --> 07:02.102
Besides all that, the Grail already belongs to me.

73
07:02.369 --> 07:07.112
All of this world's treasures without exception
trace their origin to my treasure house.

74
07:07.265 --> 07:08.374
They do, do they?

75
07:08.620 --> 07:11.124
Then I assume that means you once held the Holy Grail,

76
07:11.417 --> 07:13.130
you can identify it by sight.

77
07:13.632 --> 07:14.325
No.

78
07:14.677 --> 07:15.190
Huh?

79
07:15.272 --> 07:17.432
Do not consider me as you would a lesser being.

80
07:17.958 --> 07:21.477
The amount of wealth in my treasury
long ago surpassed my own knowledge.

81
07:22.122 --> 07:25.738
But that the Holy Grail is a treasure
also means that it belongs to me.

82
07:26.431 --> 07:28.811
And any who would take it for themselves

83
07:29.477 --> 07:32.634
is not but a filthy scoundrel and a common thief.

84
07:32.821 --> 07:37.004
Your words are no different than
Caster's senseless and insane rants.

85
07:37.651 --> 07:41.016
It appears he isn't the only
Servant to have gone completely mad.

86
07:42.151 --> 07:43.999
Come, let's not go that far.

87
07:45.526 --> 07:50.164
However, I believe I now have a clue
as to what goldie's actual identity is.

88
07:50.995 --> 07:56.727
So then, Archer, you suggested if we desire
the Grail we must first get your permission?

89
07:56.987 --> 08:03.634
Indeed, however there is no reason whatsoever
for me to reward lowly mongrels of your ilk.

90
08:04.494 --> 08:07.446
Wait a minute, you're going to be stingy?

91
08:07.612 --> 08:12.502
Fool, my magnanimity is limited to
my vassals and to my loyal subjects.

92
08:12.927 --> 08:17.041
Which means, Rider, if you were to swear fealty to me,

93
08:17.969 --> 08:19.657
I could lend you a Grail or two,

94
08:20.267 --> 08:21.867
whenever you felt the need for one.

95
08:22.282 --> 08:24.919
Sorry, that is totally out of the question.

96
08:25.292 --> 08:30.748
But tell me, Archer, surely you have no special
interest in the Holy Grail itself, do you?

97
08:30.848 --> 08:34.614
Of course not, but I must render my judgment upon those

98
08:34.854 --> 08:36.807
who would dare to steal treasure from me.

99
08:37.286 --> 08:39.254
It's simply a matter of principle.

100
08:39.996 --> 08:42.733
Hmm, I'm curious, Archer.

101
08:43.306 --> 08:46.885
On what morals and reasoning are
these principles of yours based?

102
08:47.139 --> 08:51.693
It is the law, my law which I
set down as the rightful king.

103
08:52.346 --> 08:53.459
Perfect.

104
08:54.159 --> 08:57.080
Living by one's own law is the epitome of kingship.

105
09:00.846 --> 09:05.602
Nevertheless, I desire the Holy Grail
so badly I could almost taste it.

106
09:05.986 --> 09:09.209
And it has always been my
style to just take what I want.

107
09:09.822 --> 09:11.829
After all, the Great Iskandar

108
09:12.640 --> 09:14.948
is the King of Conquerors, is he not?

109
09:15.550 --> 09:17.243
Right and wrong are irrelevant.

110
09:17.663 --> 09:19.860
You break the law and I will punish you.

111
09:20.380 --> 09:22.531
There is no place for discussion.

112
09:23.097 --> 09:23.679
Hmm.

113
09:24.703 --> 09:27.138
Which means that all we have left to us

114
09:27.293 --> 09:29.602
is to meet on the field of combat.

115
09:31.551 --> 09:35.975
So then, Archer, would you still like
us to help you finish this off tonight?

116
09:36.375 --> 09:38.397
There'll be plenty of time to kill each other after.

117
09:38.877 --> 09:45.111
Indeed, or do you dare sit there and cast aspersions
on the superior drink I did you the honor of providing?

118
09:45.712 --> 09:49.759
No, of course not, I wouldn't dream
of letting this drink go to waste.

119
09:52.992 --> 09:54.312
King of Conquerors.

120
09:54.412 --> 09:54.992
Hmm?

121
09:55.480 --> 10:00.437
A moment ago you agreed that the Holy Grail's
rightful ownership lies with another and not yourself.

122
10:00.944 --> 10:03.059
And yet you would just take it by force?

123
10:03.600 --> 10:06.560
What makes the Grail so important to you?

124
10:18.044 --> 10:19.371
Reincarnation.

125
10:19.704 --> 10:20.444
Huh?

126
10:20.657 --> 10:21.546
What?

127
10:21.827 --> 10:24.567
Wait a minute, wasn't your goal
supposed to be world conquest?

128
10:24.688 --> 10:25.393
Ah!

129
10:27.733 --> 10:31.754
Idiot, as if I would leave the
conquering to some mere cup.

130
10:32.201 --> 10:35.058
Conquering the world is my dream to make true.

131
10:35.524 --> 10:37.626
The wish I would ask of the Holy Grail

132
10:38.512 --> 10:40.494
is the first step towards that goal.

133
10:41.081 --> 10:44.755
Mongrel, you would dare challenge me for my treasure

134
10:44.989 --> 10:46.782
over something so trivial?

135
10:47.243 --> 10:49.843
Even in magic lends us form in this world,

136
10:50.109 --> 10:52.442
ultimately we remain Servants.

137
10:54.554 --> 10:57.407
I wish to live as flesh and blood

138
10:57.874 --> 11:00.768
within this world in which I find myself.

139
11:01.295 --> 11:02.990
And with nothing but my body

140
11:03.230 --> 11:05.085
I shall defy both heaven and Earth,

141
11:05.472 --> 11:08.908
succeeding in that endeavor is
the true meaning of conquest.

142
11:09.588 --> 11:10.621
Thus it begins.

143
11:11.236 --> 11:14.477
Then proceeds onward and finally is finished.

144
11:16.977 --> 11:19.272
Such is the path of my conquest.

145
11:19.900 --> 11:22.675
Hmm, then the matter is settled.

146
11:23.381 --> 11:26.296
I shall take great pleasure in killing you myself.

147
11:27.399 --> 11:29.210
You don't have to remind me of the obvious.

148
11:30.004 --> 11:35.649
I have every intention of plundering your abundant
storehouse until it's been laid bare, so get ready.

149
11:36.202 --> 11:40.179
That is hardly fitting of how a true king should behave.

150
11:40.745 --> 11:45.337
Oh, well then, let us hear what
you would ask of the Grail,

151
11:45.850 --> 11:47.037
if you were to win it.

152
11:51.783 --> 11:54.663
I wish for my homeland's salvation.

153
11:55.829 --> 11:58.429
With the omnipotent wish granting device,

154
12:00.053 --> 12:02.526
I shall avert Britain's fate of destruction.

155
12:07.836 --> 12:10.350
They're having a drinking party of all things?

156
12:10.846 --> 12:14.307
Shall I continue to leave Archer to his own devices?

157
12:14.806 --> 12:16.544
Hmm, it can't be helped.

158
12:17.037 --> 12:23.293
After all, when one is King of Kings, it simply wouldn't
do to turn one's back on an interesting invitation.

159
12:24.428 --> 12:30.584
Incidentally, Kirei, how do you judge the
relative strengths of Rider and Archer?

160
12:31.718 --> 12:36.064
Rider may very well possess a trump
card that surpasses the gordius wheel.

161
12:36.866 --> 12:39.312
I believe we should put this to the test.

162
12:39.734 --> 12:43.640
Hmm, with Rider and his Master
drinking and their guard's down,

163
12:43.879 --> 12:47.249
a better chance to attack them
will never again present itself.

164
12:47.742 --> 12:50.736
The odds of victory don't matter to our overall plan.

165
12:51.156 --> 12:52.946
Even if Assassin is defeated,

166
12:53.306 --> 12:55.881
as long as he can gauge their relative strengths,

167
12:56.096 --> 12:57.934
our objective will be accomplished.

168
12:58.726 --> 13:00.049
We do have the option

169
13:00.356 --> 13:03.072
of launching an attack right now, Kirei.

170
13:03.668 --> 13:05.396
I have no objections.

171
13:06.062 --> 13:10.265
I believe it will take roughly ten
minutes to summon all the Assassins.

172
13:11.446 --> 13:13.258
Fine, give the order.

173
13:14.008 --> 13:16.368
It is a large gamble, but even if it fails,

174
13:16.536 --> 13:17.945
we stand to lose nothing.

175
13:19.072 --> 13:22.069
Use a command seal to give Assassin the following order.

176
13:22.916 --> 13:25.946
Be victorious no matter the cost, got it?

177
13:30.676 --> 13:35.601
Hey, King of Knights,
did you just say that you would change fate?

178
13:36.056 --> 13:39.328
Does that mean that you wish to change events long past?

179
13:39.488 --> 13:43.868
Indeed, even if it is a wish that
a miracle alone can not fulfill.

180
13:44.436 --> 13:46.783
If the Holy Grail is truly omnipotent,

181
13:47.147 --> 13:48.233
then surely...

182
13:51.012 --> 13:54.841
Um, Saber, just so I am clear on this,

183
13:55.261 --> 14:00.626
it was back during your time that his country
you call Britain was conquered and fell?

184
14:01.076 --> 14:02.896
When it was under your rule?

185
14:03.063 --> 14:06.084
Correct, that is why I can not allow it.

186
14:06.686 --> 14:08.486
And that is why I regret it.

187
14:08.546 --> 14:10.472
Why I want to alter that outcome,

188
14:10.856 --> 14:14.109
for it was I and none other who was to blame.

189
14:17.130 --> 14:18.933
Archer, what's so amusing?

190
14:20.040 --> 14:23.757
You call yourself a king and are praised by all as such,

191
14:24.272 --> 14:25.958
and yet you feel regret.

192
14:27.936 --> 14:30.768
How can I not laugh at such nonsense?

193
14:31.446 --> 14:35.089
Saber, surely you do not really mean

194
14:36.197 --> 14:40.185
that you would erase the marks that
you yourself have left on history?

195
14:40.286 --> 14:42.336
I do, and what of it?

196
14:42.576 --> 14:43.662
Why do you laugh?

197
14:43.836 --> 14:47.727
My beloved country to which I
devoted my whole life was destroyed.

198
14:47.842 --> 14:49.893
Why is my sadness about that strange?

199
14:50.093 --> 14:51.866
Did you hear that drivel, Rider?

200
14:52.126 --> 14:55.480
Did you hear what this little girl who
calls herself King of Knights said?

201
14:55.600 --> 14:58.977
Her beloved country to which she devoted her whole life.

202
14:59.176 --> 15:01.046
Why is that humorous to you?

203
15:02.846 --> 15:04.276
For their country's prosperity,

204
15:04.489 --> 15:07.575
a true king should be willing to make any sacrifice.

205
15:08.041 --> 15:09.087
You are wrong.

206
15:10.486 --> 15:12.358
The king does not devote himself.

207
15:12.628 --> 15:14.077
It is the nation and the people

208
15:14.303 --> 15:16.423
who must devote themselves to the king.

209
15:16.656 --> 15:18.258
You have reversed the concept.

210
15:18.636 --> 15:19.391
I what?

211
15:19.813 --> 15:21.995
Those are the words of a brutal tyrant.

212
15:22.143 --> 15:22.937
Just so.

213
15:23.674 --> 15:26.536
We are heroes precisely because we are tyrants.

214
15:26.809 --> 15:32.758
However, Saber, if a king regrets his rule or
regrets the manner in which his rule came to an end,

215
15:33.086 --> 15:36.895
that king is nothing but a fool,
worse than the tyrant you disdain.

216
15:37.388 --> 15:40.658
Iskandar, your reign ended with all your heirs slain

217
15:40.993 --> 15:43.988
and your great empire broken up by civil war.

218
15:44.282 --> 15:48.127
Do you mean to say you have no regrets about that end?

219
15:48.302 --> 15:49.111
None at all.

220
15:50.855 --> 15:57.008
Not if it came to pass by my own decisions and by
the considerable sacrifices of my many retainers.

221
15:57.526 --> 15:59.100
Its destruction was inevitable.

222
15:59.866 --> 16:02.149
I shall mourn it and shed tears over it,

223
16:02.696 --> 16:04.410
but I shall never regret it.

224
16:05.073 --> 16:05.983
But you... 

225
16:06.030 --> 16:07.989
Let alone undo it all!

226
16:08.326 --> 16:13.796
Such an act would be an insufferable insult to all
those who fought and bled and died alongside me.

227
16:13.947 --> 16:16.771
It is only a warrior who can find glory in destruction,

228
16:16.887 --> 16:19.568
worthless is a king who fails to protect the weak.

229
16:19.756 --> 16:22.703
A just rule guided by just laws,

230
16:23.030 --> 16:25.113
those are the true duties of a king.

231
16:26.226 --> 16:28.830
So you, the king of your realm,

232
16:29.056 --> 16:30.727
are a slave to what is right?

233
16:31.066 --> 16:32.002
I am.

234
16:32.577 --> 16:34.912
Kings are martyrs to their ideals.

235
16:36.265 --> 16:38.678
That is not the way a person should live.

236
16:39.793 --> 16:41.623
If I rule a nation as king,

237
16:41.883 --> 16:43.965
I can not expect to live as a person.

238
16:44.996 --> 16:49.339
King of Conquerors, you seek the
Grail merely for your own benefit.

239
16:49.572 --> 16:51.969
And as such, you could never understand that.

240
16:52.996 --> 16:57.363
You, who became a ruler only
to satisfy your endless greed.

241
16:57.426 --> 17:00.012
A king without greed is even worse than a figurehead!

242
17:01.419 --> 17:05.532
Saber, you said you would
martyr yourself for your ideals.

243
17:05.926 --> 17:10.057
In life you must have been something
akin to the purest of all the saints.

244
17:10.452 --> 17:13.621
A proud and noble figure at the very least.

245
17:14.167 --> 17:19.375
But who can truly admire the rough and thorny
path that a martyr must follow in life?

246
17:19.983 --> 17:22.291
Who actually dreams of such an ending?

247
17:24.642 --> 17:27.990
A king must be greedier than any other.

248
17:28.156 --> 17:31.684
He must laugh more loudly and rage for much longer

249
17:32.086 --> 17:35.454
and embody the very extreme of all things good and evil.

250
17:36.121 --> 17:39.051
That is why his retainers envy his very existence.

251
17:39.426 --> 17:40.764
And adore him as well.

252
17:41.231 --> 17:43.261
And why the flames of aspiration

253
17:43.736 --> 17:45.729
to be just as the king is

254
17:45.842 --> 17:47.415
can burn within his people.

255
17:52.356 --> 17:54.195
Proud king of chivalry,

256
17:55.016 --> 17:58.221
the righteousness and ideals you embraced in life

257
17:58.396 --> 18:00.627
may have indeed saved your nation

258
18:00.760 --> 18:02.489
and her people once.

259
18:03.610 --> 18:07.667
However, surely you must know what became of those

260
18:07.902 --> 18:09.535
who were saved by you.

261
18:10.029 --> 18:13.007
But then were left to fend for themselves.

262
18:13.376 --> 18:14.327
What are you saying?

263
18:25.567 --> 18:27.473
You may indeed have saved them,

264
18:28.266 --> 18:29.721
but you never led them.

265
18:31.056 --> 18:34.313
You never showed them all
what a king should really be.

266
18:34.647 --> 18:37.364
You abandoned your men when they lost their way.

267
18:37.617 --> 18:40.096
Then alone and untroubled by that fact,

268
18:40.362 --> 18:44.341
you went on to follow your own
pretty little ideals to the end.

269
18:46.263 --> 18:48.942
Thus, you are no true king.

270
18:49.433 --> 18:55.450
You spent your life enraptured by a false idol
of a humble king who always serves others.

271
18:56.166 --> 18:57.745
You're just a little girl.

272
19:01.946 --> 19:02.746
I...

273
19:06.022 --> 19:06.773
I...

274
19:18.646 --> 19:20.600
What are you laughing at, Archer?

275
19:20.729 --> 19:21.953
Oh, nothing.

276
19:22.310 --> 19:25.953
I simply felt that your anguished
face was a rather lovely sight.

277
19:26.736 --> 19:30.787
It was the face of the virgins who
showered me with flower pedals in my bed.

278
19:31.483 --> 19:33.334
A woman after my own heart.

279
19:33.646 --> 19:34.500
Bastard!

280
19:38.432 --> 19:39.066
Huh?

281
19:40.266 --> 19:41.080
Hmm.

282
19:41.803 --> 19:42.591
Ah.

283
19:45.746 --> 19:46.513
Ahhh.

284
19:51.010 --> 19:52.216
Assassin.

285
20:00.726 --> 20:03.735
So is this all your doing, goldie?

286
20:04.303 --> 20:07.617
Tokiomi, what a shameful cur.

287
20:08.472 --> 20:12.176
This isn't fair. Why are there
so many Assassins surrounding us?

288
20:12.576 --> 20:15.046
We are one divided into many.

289
20:15.286 --> 20:17.407
An army and also one.

290
20:17.666 --> 20:19.988
A Servant with many shadows.

291
20:20.126 --> 20:21.108
And one.

292
20:24.666 --> 20:28.979
A Servant with separate bodies for
each of his multiple personalities?

293
20:31.492 --> 20:33.545
Rider, um, I...

294
20:33.716 --> 20:34.853
Oh, calm yourself.

295
20:35.346 --> 20:37.050
Nothing to worry about, boy.

296
20:37.516 --> 20:39.894
Even those rude enough to interrupt our banquet

297
20:40.427 --> 20:42.875
may yet show us which is the greatest king.

298
20:43.263 --> 20:47.576
So I suppose you'll invite them all to our
little banquet as well, King of Conquerors?

299
20:47.960 --> 20:52.195
But of course, a king's words are
meant for all to hear and absorb.

300
20:52.562 --> 20:56.651
If they have come here to listen,
it matters not if they are friend or foe.

301
20:59.646 --> 21:01.239
Now then, don't hold back.

302
21:01.779 --> 21:04.837
Any who would speak with us, come forth and take a cup.

303
21:05.377 --> 21:08.195
This drink is as your blood.

304
21:16.358 --> 21:17.220
Very well.

305
21:18.007 --> 21:21.137
As I said, this drink is as your blood.

306
21:21.959 --> 21:24.723
If you insist on spilling it here tonight,

307
21:25.221 --> 21:26.351
then so be it.

308
21:40.460 --> 21:44.966
Saber, Archer, here is our banquet's final question.

309
21:45.405 --> 21:48.482
It is, does a king always stand alone?

310
21:49.660 --> 21:54.170
The king must indeed be alone, always.

311
21:54.343 --> 21:57.602
No, no, you obviously don't understand.

312
21:58.044 --> 22:00.779
I suppose I'll just have to show you both right now

313
22:00.860 --> 22:05.209
exactly what a real king is all about when
faced with an adversary like this one.

314
22:17.412 --> 22:18.515
Huh?

315
22:19.428 --> 22:20.181
Huh?

316
22:29.805 --> 22:31.352
A reality marble?

317
22:31.765 --> 22:32.974
That's impossible.

318
22:33.455 --> 22:36.580
A mental image materialized into the real world.

319
22:38.558 --> 22:42.309
My glorious armies once rode across these sands.

320
22:42.589 --> 22:48.165
A place that all the heroes who stood with
me through joy and sorrow will never forget.

321
22:54.409 --> 22:57.955
I can make this world as real as real can ever be.

322
22:58.295 --> 23:01.290
Because it still exists deep within our hearts.

323
23:04.335 --> 23:06.697
Behold my endless armies.

324
23:07.130 --> 23:12.986
Their bodies utterly destroyed and their souls
offered to the current world as heroic spirits of old.

325
23:13.126 --> 23:17.627
And still, these legendary heroes
pledge their loyalty to me.

326
23:18.820 --> 23:21.215
My bond with them is my greatest treasure.

327
23:21.455 --> 23:22.985
My path to kingship.

328
23:23.230 --> 23:25.738
The ultimate noble phantasm that I possess!

329
23:25.905 --> 23:28.764
I order in Haitari.

330
23:34.655 --> 23:37.906
Wait a minute, so each of these is a Servant?

331
23:39.165 --> 23:41.276
It has been a long time, partner.

332
23:44.526 --> 23:45.612
Hear me!

333
23:45.835 --> 23:50.391
A king must live a grand life and
embody his people's image of admiration.

334
23:50.612 --> 23:53.192
Aye, aye, aye.

335
23:55.555 --> 24:00.792
He who is worthy of all heroes envy and
he who leads their way, that is a king!

336
24:01.385 --> 24:04.074
Therefore, the king is not alone,

337
24:04.682 --> 24:09.996
for his will equals that of all who would
follow him to his ultimate glory combined!

338
24:10.279 --> 24:13.525
Aye, aye, aye!

339
24:13.922 --> 24:18.023
Now then, shall we begin our battle, Assassin?

340
24:18.902 --> 24:26.104
As you can see, what we have created is a vast plane
and with our superior numbers, we hold the advantage.

341
24:27.047 --> 24:29.028
Annihilate them!

342
25:15.455 --> 25:18.393
Aaarggh!

343
25:39.796 --> 25:42.603
That ending wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for.

344
25:44.092 --> 25:45.903
We have said all there is to say.

345
25:46.720 --> 25:50.069
I suppose that will do for today.

346
25:50.505 --> 25:52.808
Wait, Rider, I have not finished.

347
25:52.885 --> 25:53.997
You may keep silent.

348
25:54.672 --> 25:57.289
Tonight was for a conversation amongst kings.

349
25:58.472 --> 26:02.869
But I no longer recognize you as a king, Saber.

350
26:08.348 --> 26:13.046
Little girl, you must wake from
your sad dream and see the truth.

351
26:13.433 --> 26:19.047
If you don't, you'll someday lose even that
modicum of pride you retain as a heroic spirit.

352
26:19.540 --> 26:24.831
The dream of a king you spoke of earlier is a
curse and a burden which blinds and cripples you.

353
26:25.012 --> 26:25.825
A what?

354
26:35.672 --> 26:38.156
Pay that base mongrel no heed, Saber.

355
26:39.144 --> 26:42.514
You are correct, follow the path you believe in.

356
26:43.864 --> 26:46.542
Your agonizing pain and terrible sorrow

357
26:46.831 --> 26:50.581
as you bear a burden of kingship
that is too heavy a weight for any

358
26:51.296 --> 26:54.873
is quite a splendid and
marvelous thing to look upon.

359
26:55.445 --> 26:58.316
Keep at it, oh great King of Knights.

360
26:58.556 --> 27:03.408
It is possible you may prove worthy
of still more of my magnificent love.

361
27:13.162 --> 27:14.051
Saber.

362
27:15.208 --> 27:16.400
I remember now.

363
27:17.372 --> 27:20.230
There was once a knight who left Camelot

364
27:20.675 --> 27:23.704
claiming the king didn't
understand how others felt.

365
27:24.938 --> 27:32.837
Well, perhaps that... that sentiment was shared by all
of the knights who sat with me at the round table.
