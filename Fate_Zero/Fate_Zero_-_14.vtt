00:03.847 --> 00:07.994
If there really is a giant monster out there,
do you think they'll authorize us to attack?

2
00:08.409 --> 00:12.529
If this was a monster movie,
I guarantee we'd be the first to get killed off.

3
00:13.337 --> 00:16.701
You know, curtain raisers to set things
up till the main character shows up.

4
00:17.087 --> 00:19.027
Uh, that's not even funny, sir.

5
00:19.169 --> 00:21.222
Whatever it is, we'll find out soon enough.

6
00:58.357 --> 01:01.332
Didn't work, it's just restoring itself.

7
01:02.595 --> 01:04.737
What incredible regenerating power.

8
01:04.888 --> 01:07.521
It's all they can do to keep it from coming ashore.

9
01:08.747 --> 01:10.094
Well, at this rate,

10
01:10.457 --> 01:12.837
I'll never get through to Caster.

11
01:14.700 --> 01:16.826
Awesome, so awesome.

12
01:17.541 --> 01:20.405
That is so totally awesome, big guy!

13
01:22.202 --> 01:23.492
The Lord has come.

14
01:23.807 --> 01:27.214
The Lord has come!

15
02:57.500 --> 02:59.915
It's terrible, how could this have happened?

16
03:01.410 --> 03:04.736
In the long and winding history of the Holy Grail Wars,

17
03:04.940 --> 03:07.729
a foul up like this is unprecedented.

18
03:08.066 --> 03:10.450
According to our observers' reports,

19
03:10.703 --> 03:13.921
even though the Mion River area is blanketed in mist,

20
03:14.209 --> 03:17.781
a large number of onlookers have
already begun to gather there.

21
03:18.706 --> 03:22.107
I fear we can no longer handle this by ourselves.

22
03:22.493 --> 03:26.072
We must petition the Mage's Association for assistance.

23
03:30.716 --> 03:32.978
What is Tokiomi doing right now?

24
03:33.386 --> 03:35.731
My master left for the scene with Archer

25
03:35.898 --> 03:38.601
immediately after Caster's monster appeared.

26
03:39.836 --> 03:43.480
In that case, I will see to the
arrangements for the cover up.

27
03:44.465 --> 03:48.296
Go to Tokiomi immediately and
assist him in any way you can.

28
03:48.816 --> 03:51.210
I understand, Father.

29
03:59.746 --> 04:02.672
This sight has begun to turn my stomach.

30
04:03.876 --> 04:09.201
Mongrels though they may be,
they are still figures of at least some slight renown.

31
04:09.989 --> 04:15.206
Yet here they are working together with all
their might to finish off that disgusting thing.

32
04:15.806 --> 04:18.669
Surely there are limits to which one may sink.

33
04:20.440 --> 04:23.606
Do you not agree with that, Tokiomi?

34
04:25.566 --> 04:27.537
We must destroy that monster

35
04:27.751 --> 04:30.295
before there are any more witnesses to the battle.

36
04:31.347 --> 04:34.078
The honor of the Tohsaka family is at stake.

37
04:35.310 --> 04:39.643
My king, that monster is a vermin
that is ravaging your garden.

38
04:40.589 --> 04:43.310
I humbly beseech you to slay it yourself.

39
04:44.345 --> 04:47.134
Dealing with pests is the job of a gardener,

40
04:47.727 --> 04:50.800
or is your intent to mock my Noble Phantasms,

41
04:51.000 --> 04:54.385
putting them on the level of a gardener's hoe, Tokiomi.

42
04:55.252 --> 04:57.097
I would never dream of such a thing,

43
04:57.249 --> 05:01.516
but as you can see, Majesty,
this creature is beyond the ability of the others.

44
05:01.677 --> 05:05.159
It's the perfect opportunity
to demonstrate your true might.

45
05:05.436 --> 05:07.737
I beg you, please take action.

46
05:12.762 --> 05:13.362
Hm.

47
05:46.726 --> 05:47.708
It can't be.

48
05:49.186 --> 05:50.735
We're leaving, Tokiomi.

49
05:51.066 --> 05:54.343
I've grown weary of watching that disgusting creature.

50
05:54.596 --> 05:57.686
No, King of Heroes, wait, I beg you.

51
05:58.881 --> 06:03.991
Tokiomi, I sacrificed four swords
thinking it might duty towards you.

52
06:05.057 --> 06:10.522
Having been defiled by touching that filthy
thing, I have no interest in retrieving them.

53
06:11.173 --> 06:13.641
Do not presume upon my generosity.

54
06:13.921 --> 06:16.091
You are the only heroic spirit alive

55
06:16.358 --> 06:17.924
able to defeat that thing.

56
06:18.615 --> 06:23.945
Given its regenerative abilities, the sole way
to defeat it is to annihilate it in one strike.

57
06:24.359 --> 06:28.697
Only your Sword of Dissociation is
capable of accomplishing that so‐-

58
06:28.722 --> 06:29.630
You fool!

59
06:30.936 --> 06:33.646
You dare suggest that I draw forth Ea here!

60
06:34.133 --> 06:37.526
Don't forget your place, I should have your head

61
06:37.663 --> 06:39.778
for being so impertinent to your king!

62
06:44.920 --> 06:50.991
I could use a Command Seal, but if I did, it would
shatter my relationship with the King of Heroes.

63
06:51.829 --> 06:55.849
Father Risei and I had originally arranged
for this Caster hunting expedition

64
06:56.114 --> 06:58.745
so that I could recover
the Command Seal I lost.

65
06:59.574 --> 07:02.942
How could my plan be backfiring so badly?

66
07:10.170 --> 07:10.968
Damn.

67
07:14.735 --> 07:16.507
What the hell is that?

68
07:17.255 --> 07:19.914
There's a weird light hovering
in the sky at six o'clock.

69
07:20.959 --> 07:22.372
It's not a helicopter.

70
07:22.692 --> 07:24.844
Is it a UFO or something?

71
07:26.357 --> 07:28.104
Control to Diablo One,

72
07:28.399 --> 07:29.961
we need a situation report.

73
07:31.562 --> 07:32.756
The situation is,

74
07:33.490 --> 07:35.590
uh, well...

75
07:36.899 --> 07:39.214
Diablo Two, gonna go down to get a closer look.

76
07:41.040 --> 07:42.617
Wait, Kobayashi!

77
07:43.776 --> 07:46.065
Diablo Two, get back here!

78
07:47.719 --> 07:51.010
Official inspection from up close
will tell us what that thing is.

79
07:53.010 --> 07:53.891
Kobayashi.

80
08:11.860 --> 08:13.930
Kobayashi!

81
08:18.330 --> 08:20.291
A fearsome creature indeed.

82
08:21.368 --> 08:23.151
It... it ate it.

83
08:30.760 --> 08:32.260
Control to Diablo One.

84
08:32.920 --> 08:34.166
What's going on over there?

85
08:34.979 --> 08:35.606
Report!

86
08:36.923 --> 08:39.198
Eyes, it has eyes.

87
08:39.818 --> 08:42.015
It's absolutely covered with eyes!

88
08:43.163 --> 08:45.294
Eyes, what do you mean it has eyes?

89
08:46.491 --> 08:48.893
Shit, that thing wants to eat me too.

90
08:50.326 --> 08:51.359
Captain Ogi.

91
08:52.736 --> 08:54.587
Diablo One engaging.

92
08:55.193 --> 08:57.388
Wait, Ogi, engaging what?

93
08:58.021 --> 08:59.712
I'll kill it before it gets me.

94
09:01.040 --> 09:02.554
This is for Kobayashi.

95
09:03.475 --> 09:05.628
I'm gonna pump you with missiles, ya bastard.

96
09:11.750 --> 09:12.964
Berserker?

97
09:13.084 --> 09:15.007
Oh man, what's he doing here?

98
09:15.294 --> 09:18.060
You fool, stay down!

99
09:18.666 --> 09:20.657
Now he decides to join us?

100
09:29.360 --> 09:30.285
Isn't that...

101
09:32.525 --> 09:35.630
Ah, so that mad dog has turned up again.

102
09:35.990 --> 09:37.478
This should be amusing.

103
09:40.682 --> 09:43.637
My king, allow me to deal with his master.

104
09:44.412 --> 09:47.107
Very well, merely toy with him.

105
09:47.691 --> 09:49.877
Then good luck to us both, Your Majesty.

106
10:06.612 --> 10:09.683
Dogs like you belong prostrated on the ground.

107
10:10.563 --> 10:12.653
Yet you dare to climb into my sky.

108
10:14.426 --> 10:17.568
Don't put on airs, you mongrel!

109
10:34.247 --> 10:35.773
Such impertinence.

110
11:04.925 --> 11:06.019
How amusing.

111
11:06.632 --> 11:09.432
I've not played a game like this in quite some time.

112
11:09.914 --> 11:12.220
For a lowly animal, you're providing me

113
11:12.654 --> 11:14.895
with no shortage of entertainment.

114
11:22.201 --> 11:23.828
I hardly recognize you,

115
11:24.985 --> 11:26.691
Kariya Matou.

116
11:29.039 --> 11:33.001
Though you turned your back on
magecraft, you still desired the Grail.

117
11:33.920 --> 11:36.984
To think you'd slink back in such a sorry state.

118
11:37.464 --> 11:40.259
The very sight of you is enough to invite whispers

119
11:40.705 --> 11:43.449
that the Matou family has fallen from grace.

120
11:46.568 --> 11:49.807
Tokiomi Tohsaka, answer me a question.

121
11:50.395 --> 11:53.532
Why did you hand your daughter Sakura over to Zouken?

122
11:54.721 --> 11:55.290
What?

123
11:56.374 --> 11:59.381
You really think that's what you should
be worrying about at this moment?

124
11:59.514 --> 12:01.960
Answer me, Tokiomi!

125
12:04.015 --> 12:05.556
Do you even need to ask?

126
12:06.663 --> 12:10.157
I did it because I wished to give
my beloved daughter a happy future.

127
12:11.485 --> 12:12.297
You what?

128
12:13.655 --> 12:17.213
All mages who have two children
eventually suffer for it.

129
12:17.728 --> 12:21.226
The family's secret arts can
be passed to only one child.

130
12:22.167 --> 12:27.134
They suffer over the issue that one of them
must be cast down into the common masses.

131
12:28.694 --> 12:31.942
The simple fact is that my wife
is superior breeding stock.

132
12:32.629 --> 12:38.269
Both Rin and Sakura were born with equally
rare natural gifts and magical abilities.

133
12:39.369 --> 12:45.061
And so both my daughters were in need of the
protection and nurturing attention of a mage family.

134
12:45.969 --> 12:51.126
For the future of one daughter I must waste the
vast potential lurking deep inside the other?

135
12:52.914 --> 12:56.617
What father would wish such a
woeful tragedy upon his children?

136
12:59.514 --> 13:00.862
Common masses.

137
13:01.815 --> 13:05.128
The memory of his children and their mother on that day.

138
13:06.118 --> 13:10.078
This heartless man is writing it off
as something for the common masses.

139
13:11.635 --> 13:14.872
If I was to preserve the hopes I
had for both sisters' abilities,

140
13:15.285 --> 13:17.440
my only option would be to send one away.

141
13:18.908 --> 13:21.966
That is why the Matou family's offer was such a godsend.

142
13:23.549 --> 13:26.086
If she were to be adopted by a mage family,

143
13:26.500 --> 13:29.565
it would give her that much greater
chance of reaching the root.

144
13:31.091 --> 13:33.713
A mage is someone who is born with great power,

145
13:34.580 --> 13:38.176
and before he knows it,
he will attain even greater heights of power.

146
13:40.046 --> 13:42.705
Even before a mage embraces his destiny,

147
13:42.899 --> 13:45.676
his responsibility to do so is in his blood.

148
13:46.418 --> 13:49.717
That is what it means to be born the child of a mage.

149
13:51.755 --> 13:54.586
If I fail, it falls to my daughter, Rin,

150
13:55.560 --> 13:58.954
and even if Rin fails in her quest, then Sakura

151
13:59.368 --> 14:02.487
may yet fulfill the dream of the Tohsaka family.

152
14:05.565 --> 14:09.203
You bastard, you want them to fight each other?

153
14:09.525 --> 14:11.018
Sister against sister?

154
14:11.565 --> 14:14.388
Even if such a development were to come to pass,

155
14:14.861 --> 14:17.718
it is still best for the future of my descendents.

156
14:17.995 --> 14:18.555
What?

157
14:19.455 --> 14:21.188
Glory will go to the victor,

158
14:21.313 --> 14:24.514
and to the loser, honor to the family of her forbearers.

159
14:24.988 --> 14:27.403
The best outcome I could possibly hope for.

160
14:27.736 --> 14:30.758
You bastard, you're insane!

161
14:31.175 --> 14:33.999
It is a waste of time to try to explain it to you.

162
14:34.883 --> 14:37.502
You don't comprehend magecraft's grandeur,

163
14:37.809 --> 14:40.330
and even turned your back and walked away from it.

164
14:40.637 --> 14:41.848
A lowly traitor.

165
14:41.873 --> 14:43.494
Screw you, bastard!

166
15:50.653 --> 15:53.006
I'll make all you bastards pay.

167
15:53.825 --> 15:56.494
You filthy rotten mages.

168
15:57.365 --> 15:58.840
I'll kill you all.

169
15:59.340 --> 16:01.539
Zouken and you.

170
16:02.335 --> 16:04.061
Every last one of you.

171
16:04.480 --> 16:06.340
I'll kill you all.

172
16:07.206 --> 16:09.419
When you turned down the family leadership,

173
16:10.236 --> 16:13.267
the Matou's magic secrets were passed on to Sakura.

174
16:14.608 --> 16:17.292
In spite of the fact that I
really should be thanking you

175
16:17.838 --> 16:19.485
for my Sakura's future,

176
16:20.618 --> 16:23.298
you are one man that I simply cannot abide.

177
16:25.590 --> 16:28.689
The weakness revealed by shirking of your obligations,

178
16:29.111 --> 16:32.561
the deficient character revealed
by your lack of indebtedness to it.

179
16:33.223 --> 16:35.598
You, Kariya Matou, are a disgrace.

180
16:36.541 --> 16:41.421
Having crossed paths with you again I
have no choice but to put you to death.

181
16:41.875 --> 16:45.844
Don't talk so high and mighty, you inhuman bastard.

182
16:46.266 --> 16:51.637
You're mistaken, shouldering one's responsibilities
is the first requisite of being human.

183
16:52.757 --> 16:55.021
It is those who fail to do so...

184
16:59.265 --> 17:01.030
...that are subhuman dogs.

185
17:01.810 --> 17:02.604
Kariya.

186
17:02.793 --> 17:06.124
Hear me now, bugs.
Devour this bastard.

187
17:07.518 --> 17:09.583
Eat him alive!

188
17:13.224 --> 17:15.530
Oh yeah, go get 'em, Bluebeard!

189
17:15.737 --> 17:18.030
Crush 'em down, tear 'em apart!

190
17:18.356 --> 17:20.717
This place is God's toy box!

191
17:21.915 --> 17:23.264
Saber!

192
17:36.135 --> 17:37.946
I am much obliged, Saber.

193
17:47.315 --> 17:49.895
I'll never be bored again as long as I live.

194
17:50.375 --> 17:53.005
I won't have to go through all
the trouble of murdering people.

195
17:53.164 --> 17:55.612
They'll die in droves
without me lifting a finger.

196
17:56.595 --> 18:01.259
They'll be flattened,
chopped to bits, smashed, eaten.

197
18:01.596 --> 18:04.431
They'll die and die and die left and right.

198
18:04.811 --> 18:10.965
I'll be able to see one kind of guts and gore
after another that I've never seen before.

199
18:11.212 --> 18:15.944
All day, every day, all around the
world, everywhere I look!

200
18:16.085 --> 18:18.512
It'll be nonstop, never‐end... 

201
18:24.292 --> 18:25.741
It stopped moving.

202
18:25.960 --> 18:26.600
Hm?

203
18:29.605 --> 18:32.885
What the... hey, what happened?

204
18:35.485 --> 18:36.282
Huh?

205
18:44.245 --> 18:46.397
That's so pretty.

206
18:50.295 --> 18:51.860
Now I get it.

207
18:52.335 --> 18:54.997
No wonder I never realized it before.

208
18:55.755 --> 18:59.951
Oh man, talk about not being able
to see the forest for the trees.

209
19:01.055 --> 19:02.301
It was in me.

210
19:02.965 --> 19:05.292
I was looking for my own guts.

211
19:05.885 --> 19:08.606
I didn't have to go searching for it.

212
19:09.225 --> 19:11.822
It was hiding right there all along.

213
19:13.178 --> 19:14.844
Ryuunosuke!

214
19:17.905 --> 19:19.545
I finally found you.

215
19:20.275 --> 19:23.033
I've been looking for you my whole life.

216
19:25.075 --> 19:26.427
What the hell, man?

217
19:27.415 --> 19:29.557
If you were inside me all along,

218
19:30.075 --> 19:31.332
I wish you would've

219
19:32.576 --> 19:35.798
just told me so in the first place.

220
19:54.622 --> 19:57.802
Ryuunosuke, my master.

221
19:58.624 --> 20:02.174
How could you die and leave me here all alone?

222
20:02.916 --> 20:06.073
But never you fear, dear Ryuunosuke,

223
20:06.606 --> 20:11.836
for I, Gilles de Rais,
will fulfill the solemn promise I made to you.

224
20:15.957 --> 20:20.953
Ryuunosuke, watch closely!
Behold my offering to you!

225
20:21.153 --> 20:24.763
I shall give you the greatest "cool!" ever!

226
20:31.360 --> 20:34.573
I just put down the man I believe to be Caster's master.

227
20:35.588 --> 20:38.034
It looks like I was right about him.

228
20:38.808 --> 20:44.008
While all the other servants are being distracted
by the monster, shall I eliminate the next target?

229
20:44.190 --> 20:47.754
Wait, Maiya, that's no ordinary monster.

230
20:48.534 --> 20:50.957
It's a creature with limitless regenerative ability.

231
20:51.730 --> 20:54.818
It's still possible that it could
reach the shore before it dissipates.

232
20:55.204 --> 20:57.648
If it does and begins to feed, it's all over.

233
20:58.388 --> 21:01.753
Caster will have a new source of
mana to maintain his physical form.

234
21:02.056 --> 21:04.633
If that happens, the damage will spread even further,

235
21:04.915 --> 21:08.148
and there's a risk that the Holy
Grail War itself will break down.

236
21:08.867 --> 21:09.834
Exactly.

237
21:11.000 --> 21:13.693
But how do we kill an indestructible monster?

238
21:14.481 --> 21:17.218
The only way is to annihilate it in a single strike.

239
21:17.864 --> 21:20.568
To do that, its entire body will have to be incinerated.

240
21:21.142 --> 21:23.625
Leaving nothing, not even the smallest scrap of flesh.

241
21:24.929 --> 21:27.595
Anti‐Personnel Noble Phantasms won't suffice.

242
21:27.842 --> 21:29.585
An Anti‐Fortress one is needed.

243
21:31.574 --> 21:35.500
Saber possesses just such an
Anti‐Fortress Noble Phantasm.

244
21:38.745 --> 21:40.942
However, because of Lancer's curse,

245
21:41.189 --> 21:42.303
she can't use it.

246
21:44.217 --> 21:45.818
We'll just have to wait and see

247
21:46.333 --> 21:48.587
exactly what they can really accomplish

248
21:49.073 --> 21:51.523
with their so‐called chivalric spirit.
