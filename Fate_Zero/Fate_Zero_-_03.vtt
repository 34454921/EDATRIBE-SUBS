1
00:04.523 --> 00:06.303
Well, everything went smoothly.

2
00:07.705 --> 00:13.840
These games of yours are tiresome and tedious
and squander my precious time, Tokiomi.

3
00:14.347 --> 00:16.793
I am very grateful, Your Highness.

4
00:19.383 --> 00:23.468
King of all Kings, Gilgamesh.

5
00:24.109 --> 00:28.115
Your deeds tonight will establish your prowess as king

6
00:28.263 --> 00:32.067
and they will reveal which of our
foes we must hunt and eliminate.

7
00:32.183 --> 00:37.190
I ask only that you stay your hand
for just a little while longer.

8
00:39.073 --> 00:40.132
Very well.

9
00:40.565 --> 00:44.928
For the time being, I shall amuse myself
with simple reconnaissance.

10
00:45.703 --> 00:49.245
This age truly fascinates me.

11
00:49.413 --> 00:52.597
I take that to mean the modern
world is to your liking?

12
00:52.692 --> 00:58.449
It's unspeakably ugly, but that is fine
in its own way.

13
00:58.753 --> 01:04.496
The important thing is whether any of the
treasures available here are truly worthy of me.

14
01:05.973 --> 01:10.432
Of course, if I find there is nothing in
this world that deserves my adoration,

15
01:10.696 --> 01:13.085
you will pay dearly for summoning me.

16
01:13.251 --> 01:16.372
Of that, you can be certain, Tokiomi.

17
01:16.693 --> 01:22.573
Worry not; the Holy Grail is surely an
item fit to please the King of Heroes.

18
01:22.623 --> 01:25.756
That will be for me to ultimately determine
and me alone.

19
01:26.015 --> 01:30.383
No matter, I'll play along with
your little schemes for the moment.

20
01:30.873 --> 01:33.767
Everything of value in this world belongs to me,

21
01:33.913 --> 01:38.574
so I can assure you, no matter how
precious this grail of yours may be,

22
01:38.813 --> 01:42.875
I will never let a lowly mongrel
even touch it without my consent.

23
01:43.042 --> 01:46.259
Tokiomi, I'll leave the details to you.

24
01:55.706 --> 01:58.286
My, my, honestly,

25
01:58.833 --> 02:02.395
I'm amazed Gilgamesh materialized
within the archer class

26
02:02.420 --> 02:05.503
considering their reputation for solo combat skills.

27
02:07.620 --> 02:11.188
Well, I can let Kirei handle things from here.

28
02:12.123 --> 02:16.297
For now, everything is
proceeding according to plan.

29
03:52.372 --> 03:53.930
Assassin was killed?

30
03:54.712 --> 03:57.327
Hey, Rider, this is big news!

31
03:57.582 --> 03:59.327
One of the seven is already out!

32
04:03.315 --> 04:04.257
Hey.

33
04:10.535 --> 04:12.460
Come on, don't you get it?

34
04:12.553 --> 04:14.264
Assassin was killed!

35
04:14.495 --> 04:15.630
Mm‐hmm.

36
04:15.665 --> 04:18.755
Rider, the Holy Grail War has started!

37
04:18.930 --> 04:24.795
I've been out gathering information day after
day after day after day, every single damn day!

38
04:24.959 --> 04:27.965
You sit around eating cookies watching stuff on the VCR!

39
04:28.050 --> 04:30.737
You're worse than a
familiar, worse than a rat!

40
04:30.897 --> 04:34.355
And I told you that I always want you to
take spirit form when I don't need you.

41
04:34.478 --> 04:37.924
I'm giving you all the manna while you're
doing nothing but eating and watching!

42
04:38.315 --> 04:39.283
Quit your whining.

43
04:39.485 --> 04:42.096
Nobody cares if Assassin is dead or alive.

44
04:42.355 --> 04:45.410
The only thing he's good at is
skulking around in the shadows.

45
04:45.525 --> 04:47.610
He could never pose a threat to me.

46
04:47.793 --> 04:51.585
Anyway, boy, here, this is what matters!

47
04:51.745 --> 04:54.972
This, the big black thing they call a B‐2!

48
04:55.125 --> 04:56.452
It's wonderful!

49
04:56.625 --> 04:58.476
I'm thinking about buying 10 or so.

50
04:58.705 --> 04:59.776
What do you think?

51
05:01.255 --> 05:05.096
For that much money, it'd be faster to
just buy the whole country outright.

52
05:05.385 --> 05:07.690
Oh, I see.

53
05:07.863 --> 05:10.803
So, the question is where to procure the money.

54
05:11.175 --> 05:17.403
Were there some major city nearby, such as Persepolis,
we could simply plunder it and get what we need.

55
05:18.558 --> 05:23.160
For the moment, I think that the biggest
obstacle for us will be this Clinton guy.

56
05:23.266 --> 05:26.490
He will prove a more formidable
opponent than Darius III.

57
05:26.810 --> 05:32.950
Well, regardless of all that, I think it's a pretty good
thing that Assassin was eliminated right off the bat.

58
05:33.446 --> 05:36.906
I mean, aren't you the type who
prefers to face his enemy head‐on?

59
05:37.205 --> 05:43.351
So, it's good news for us that the guy who uses sneak
attacks and devious tricks to fight his battles is out.

60
05:43.468 --> 05:46.688
We could get some good use from these Tomahawk things, too.

61
05:46.835 --> 05:49.996
Saber, Lancer, Archer, the three great knight classes,

62
05:50.095 --> 05:52.737
not to mention the Berserker,
whose sole skill is to break things,

63
05:52.805 --> 05:56.200
are gonna be toast when you use
that noble phantasm of yours.

64
05:56.331 --> 05:58.078
That just leaves Caster to worry about.

65
05:58.131 --> 06:00.579
If we could only find out what
his true identity is, we could... 

66
06:00.645 --> 06:02.538
How was Assassin taken down?

67
06:02.855 --> 06:03.418
Huh?

68
06:03.785 --> 06:04.572
Tell me.

69
06:04.985 --> 06:06.666
Who was it that defeated him?

70
06:07.315 --> 06:08.888
You saw it, right?

71
06:09.195 --> 06:12.114
I, uh, I think it was Tohsaka's servant.

72
06:12.325 --> 06:13.249
It was brutal:

73
06:13.517 --> 06:18.510
his brilliant appearance, his quick attacks,
everything was golden, bright, and flashy.

74
06:18.652 --> 06:20.955
It all happened so fast, I couldn't tell what... 

75
06:20.955 --> 06:22.017
You fool!

76
06:23.795 --> 06:28.571
If I am to fight someone, it will be the victor
of all the other battles between the servants.

77
06:28.877 --> 06:31.510
Why weren't you paying attention to how he won?

78
06:32.385 --> 06:33.729
Well, it matters not.

79
06:34.280 --> 06:39.088
Did anything else strike you about the flashy
gold man or the way he fought the battle?

80
06:39.389 --> 06:44.215
But...but it was the middle of the
night and it was all over in a second.

81
06:45.985 --> 06:49.738
Hey, Rider, normally a servant
only has one noble phantasm, right?

82
06:49.945 --> 06:51.835
Yes, of course, that's the rule.

83
06:52.676 --> 06:56.531
But how many isn't the correct way
to conceptualize a noble phantasm.

84
06:56.835 --> 07:02.798
As I'm sure you already know, a noble phantasm is the
physical manifestation of a hero's most indelible legend

85
07:02.835 --> 07:04.380
or most famous tale.

86
07:04.626 --> 07:09.534
Sometimes, it may be a specific
ability or a special method of attack.

87
07:09.835 --> 07:15.015
So, then, is there a noble phantasm that consists
of throwing dozens of swords at an opponent?

88
07:15.099 --> 07:18.303
A sword that makes copies of itself, really?

89
07:18.685 --> 07:20.895
Huh, yes, it's possible.

90
07:21.015 --> 07:24.274
That could still qualify as a single noble phantasm.

91
07:26.167 --> 07:29.105
But, wait, those swords weren't copies.

92
07:29.300 --> 07:31.607
Each one of them had a completely different shape.

93
07:32.825 --> 07:38.206
Ah, forget it, we'll just have to discover each
of our enemies' identities as we encounter them.

94
07:43.310 --> 07:45.177
Do you really think that would be wise?

95
07:45.257 --> 07:48.038
Yes, actually it'll be more fun!

96
07:48.335 --> 07:51.046
Food, sex, sleep, and war!

97
07:51.385 --> 07:55.065
Whatever you do,
you should always enjoy it to the fullest;

98
07:55.215 --> 07:57.055
that is the secret of life.

99
07:59.388 --> 08:04.629
All right now, let's go see if we can find
ourselves some invigorating entertainment outside.

100
08:04.895 --> 08:06.148
We ride forth, boy!

101
08:06.225 --> 08:07.168
Prepare yourself!

102
08:07.395 --> 08:10.082
Uh, we ride forth? To where?

103
08:10.145 --> 08:11.369
Well, to somewhere.

104
08:11.416 --> 08:12.728
We can go anywhere!

105
08:12.865 --> 08:14.075
Oh, come on, now!

106
08:14.150 --> 08:17.887
Let's face it, you can't have been
the only one who was watching Tohsaka,

107
08:18.240 --> 08:21.668
which means that news of Assassin's
death is making the rounds.

108
08:22.219 --> 08:25.422
The others are probably going to
spring into action all at once,

109
08:26.916 --> 08:30.425
but we shall crush each of them as we come across them.

110
08:30.755 --> 08:32.318
Go find and crush them all?

111
08:32.585 --> 08:34.131
It won't be that easy.

112
08:34.295 --> 08:35.757
I am Rider

113
08:36.110 --> 08:40.756
and my speed far exceeds that of any
other servant I will face in this war.

114
08:44.975 --> 08:46.315
Wait, wait, wait, not here!

115
08:46.315 --> 08:48.344
You'll blow up the whole house!

116
08:49.605 --> 08:51.521
My servant has been lost.

117
08:51.854 --> 08:54.236
I have forfeited my rights as a master

118
08:54.576 --> 08:57.015
and cannot continue the Holy Grail War.

119
08:57.285 --> 09:03.063
In accordance with the treaty, I, Kirei
Kotomine, ask that the church grant me sanctuary.

120
09:03.745 --> 09:04.818
Request granted.

121
09:04.995 --> 09:07.626
In my role as overseer of this war,

122
09:07.678 --> 09:11.009
I, Risei Kotomine,
guarantee your safety here.

123
09:11.545 --> 09:13.088
Enter in peace.

124
09:14.714 --> 09:18.291
Father, isn't this church being watched?

125
09:18.755 --> 09:22.930
No, this holy place has been
declared a neutral sanctuary.

126
09:23.371 --> 09:27.718
The Holy Church will censure any
master who dares defy the decree.

127
09:28.170 --> 09:30.783
Then, you're sure it's safe here?

128
09:31.315 --> 09:32.178
Mmm.

129
09:33.145 --> 09:36.135
But still, you should keep watch just in case.

130
09:36.448 --> 09:39.168
Post a guard here at all times just to be sure.

131
09:39.655 --> 09:42.136
Yes, understood.

132
09:43.188 --> 09:45.888
Tell me, who was observing the battle?

133
09:46.190 --> 09:50.913
Before the battle, I detected the presence
of familiars from four separate masters.

134
09:51.055 --> 09:55.434
Two days ago, I was able to confirm the
summoning of the final servant, Caster.

135
09:55.744 --> 10:00.832
All of the Holy Grail War servants should have
now arrived and the fighting will begin shortly.

136
10:01.845 --> 10:03.713
One unaccounted for.

137
10:04.225 --> 10:08.936
I had hoped that all the masters would be
watching and taking note of the encounter.

138
10:09.855 --> 10:16.183
At this point in the war, observing the three families'
estates would be a master's obvious course of action.

139
10:16.945 --> 10:20.575
That's right, and if they can't even think to do that,

140
10:20.784 --> 10:25.874
it would never even begin to occur to them
to worry about the existence of us assassins.

141
10:27.875 --> 10:33.376
We spirits of the shadows shall sneak up behind
those masters who believe Assassin to be dead.

142
10:33.545 --> 10:35.275
We shall sneak up behind them,

143
10:35.465 --> 10:40.129
and this time, we shall become
true shadows in the darkness.

144
10:41.175 --> 10:43.493
The battle for the grail is now at hand.

145
10:44.181 --> 10:47.974
At last, it's time for the
fourth Holy Grail War to begin.

146
10:48.516 --> 10:53.923
These tired old eyes of mine will finally
see a wondrous miracle be performed.

147
11:10.172 --> 11:11.151
Oh, my!

148
11:11.252 --> 11:13.471
So, this is where Kiritsugu was born?

149
11:13.672 --> 11:17.872
Well, Saber, how did you enjoy
your journey through the sky?

150
11:18.262 --> 11:20.341
It was really nothing to speak of.

151
11:20.592 --> 11:23.602
It was far simpler than I had actually anticipated.

152
11:23.755 --> 11:28.263
Yes, well, I suppose that flying must be
nothing special to a real hero, right?

153
11:28.352 --> 11:30.185
No, that's not it.

154
11:30.590 --> 11:35.578
Upon materialization, all servants
receive knowledge of the modern world.

155
11:35.822 --> 11:40.108
If required, I could even pilot
this aircraft with relative ease.

156
11:40.202 --> 11:41.435
You could?

157
11:41.912 --> 11:43.041
Are you serious?

158
11:43.236 --> 11:47.329
My riding skill allows me to
command any beast or vehicle,

159
11:47.534 --> 11:51.307
with the only exception being
phantasmal or divine beasts.

160
11:51.733 --> 11:56.132
Once I put the saddle between my legs
and take the reins, I'm in control.

161
11:56.199 --> 11:58.907
The saddle between your legs and take the reins?

162
11:59.983 --> 12:00.831
What is it?

163
12:01.063 --> 12:03.486
Did I say something amusing to you?

164
12:03.733 --> 12:04.783
Uh‐uh.

165
12:06.129 --> 12:10.783
Still, you must be the only servant who
has flown in an airplane in physical form.

166
12:11.099 --> 12:12.749
I apologize for that.

167
12:13.244 --> 12:14.913
If only I could take spirit form.

168
12:15.279 --> 12:17.812
No, I didn't mean it like that, really.

169
12:18.218 --> 12:20.533
I never get tired of watching you.

170
12:21.713 --> 12:23.939
Irisviel, is there something odd about me?

171
12:24.305 --> 12:26.503
No, no, not at all.

172
12:26.742 --> 12:31.133
When you laugh like that,
there seems to be some hidden meaning behind it.

173
12:31.416 --> 12:32.303
What is it?

174
12:32.423 --> 12:34.189
I want you to be frank with me.

175
12:35.143 --> 12:38.785
It means that your being stuck in
physical form isn't without its merits.

176
12:39.239 --> 12:42.915
It's given me many enjoyable
hours of choosing outfits for you.

177
12:43.463 --> 12:48.696
Irisviel, is this manner of dress
truly common for women of this era?

178
12:49.170 --> 12:51.575
I choose it for you to balance out my own outfit.

179
12:51.775 --> 12:52.828
You don't care for it?

180
12:52.941 --> 12:54.068
No, it is fine.

181
12:54.521 --> 12:58.793
It is rather easy to move in, and
besides, I'm used to dressing as a man.

182
13:03.494 --> 13:05.751
This place is so very alive!

183
13:05.818 --> 13:09.677
Kiritsugu was supposed to have arrived
here in Japan already, wasn't he?

184
13:09.943 --> 13:12.185
That's right, 12 hours before us.

185
13:12.451 --> 13:15.717
But, don't worry, he'll find us as
soon as he's certain the time is right.

186
13:16.150 --> 13:20.891
For the moment, we'll just have to keep an eye
on things so that we can act when the time comes.

187
13:21.978 --> 13:26.120
We've come all this way, I'd like to
enjoy the city before the fighting starts.

188
13:26.374 --> 13:27.540
That's dangerous.

189
13:27.758 --> 13:32.890
We should first concentrate on securing a base
of operations and discuss plans with Kiritsugu.

190
13:33.170 --> 13:35.789
Well, yes, I suppose you're right about that.

191
13:36.078 --> 13:40.532
But it's such a waste; we've come all
this way to such an exciting place!

192
13:40.911 --> 13:42.491
That, and...

193
13:43.966 --> 13:46.392
it's my very first time travelling.

194
13:46.983 --> 13:47.550
Oh?

195
13:48.303 --> 13:52.862
This is the first time I've ever ventured out
into the world outside the confines of my home.

196
13:53.230 --> 13:56.816
Are you telling me that you spent
your entire life inside that castle?

197
13:59.613 --> 14:03.608
You see, I was a puppet created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

198
14:04.398 --> 14:06.889
Of course, it isn't as though I'm wholly ignorant;

199
14:07.278 --> 14:10.383
Kiritsugu brought me movies and videos and pictures,

200
14:10.558 --> 14:14.698
and he's tried in every way to teach me
everything he could about the outside world.

201
14:15.199 --> 14:19.120
But this is the first time that I've actually
been able to see it with my own eyes,

202
14:19.542 --> 14:24.357
and so, please, forgive me!
I got overly excited.

203
14:28.156 --> 14:29.496
Please stop the car.

204
14:35.808 --> 14:39.324
Walking through the city will be a
brand new experience for me as well.

205
14:47.528 --> 14:49.825
It is a knight's duty to serve as escort;

206
14:50.318 --> 14:52.108
I shall do my very best.

207
14:53.779 --> 14:54.693
Come with me.

208
15:16.387 --> 15:19.387
The equipment you requested arrived a little while ago.

209
15:19.991 --> 15:24.046
Madam Irisviel and Saber have just
arrived here in Fuyuki as well.

210
15:24.452 --> 15:29.105
All the other masters will likely assume that
she is Saber's master and act accordingly.

211
15:29.671 --> 15:30.590
Understood.

212
15:31.015 --> 15:33.860
There was an incident last night at the Tohsaka Estate.

213
15:34.254 --> 15:35.667
I recorded this footage.

214
15:40.415 --> 15:42.307
What's your analysis of this?

215
15:42.947 --> 15:44.850
It seems too good to be true.

216
15:45.494 --> 15:49.021
There seem to be insufficient time
between Assassin's infiltration

217
15:49.012 --> 15:51.165
and the Tohsaka servants' attack.

218
15:51.531 --> 15:56.668
Assassin has a skill that masks his presence,
making it improbable he was detected in advance.

219
15:56.911 --> 16:00.529
It is my opinion that Tohsaka was expecting an intruder.

220
16:00.911 --> 16:05.476
In a battle amongst servants,
learning their identities is quite critical.

221
16:06.211 --> 16:10.150
Why would Tohsaka expose his servant like he did?

222
16:10.381 --> 16:12.476
He must have had a very good reason.

223
16:12.881 --> 16:14.463
I suppose he had to.

224
16:15.471 --> 16:18.646
Tell me, what became of Assassin's master?

225
16:18.891 --> 16:21.114
He took refuge in a church last night.

226
16:21.351 --> 16:24.182
The overseer declared him to be under his protection.

227
16:24.636 --> 16:28.098
Assassin's master is Kirei Kotomine.

228
16:29.300 --> 16:32.836
Maiya, send a familiar to watch the Fuyuki church.

229
16:33.614 --> 16:34.824
Are you certain of that?

230
16:34.918 --> 16:37.953
Masters are forbidding to take
action inside the neutral zone.

231
16:38.113 --> 16:40.133
That's been established around the church.

232
16:40.297 --> 16:42.434
Place it just far enough away

233
16:43.014 --> 16:45.300
that the priest won't be able to spot it.

234
16:46.035 --> 16:48.074
Very well, understood.

235
17:05.104 --> 17:07.618
The item I left you, where is it?

236
17:07.934 --> 17:08.758
Right here.

237
17:25.198 --> 17:26.821
Approximately two seconds.

238
17:27.294 --> 17:28.427
I'm surprised.

239
17:28.724 --> 17:29.578
Indeed.

240
17:36.368 --> 17:41.401
I was just thinking,
Illya weighs a lot less than that Walther.

241
17:42.217 --> 17:45.827
She's...eight years old already.

242
17:52.531 --> 17:56.208
Focus on the matter at
hand, just empty your mind.

243
18:02.161 --> 18:05.013
Think of nothing else except your plan.

244
18:19.951 --> 18:21.371
It's wonderful!

245
18:21.484 --> 18:24.446
Almost like a mirror that reflects the night sky.

246
18:37.941 --> 18:42.976
It's fun to walk around a strange and wondrous
new town accompanied by a gallant gentleman.

247
18:43.498 --> 18:46.248
Did I really make an acceptable gentleman escort?

248
18:46.514 --> 18:48.730
You were absolutely perfect, Saber.

249
18:48.871 --> 18:52.271
You really were the most wonderful
knight a girl could ever hope for.

250
18:52.411 --> 18:55.117
You honor me, Your Highness.

251
18:59.108 --> 19:01.566
Saber, do you like the sea?

252
19:02.477 --> 19:05.363
I suppose; I don't really know.

253
19:06.148 --> 19:08.565
In my country, and way back in my time,

254
19:08.784 --> 19:12.918
the sea was a source of attacks
by barbarians from the mainland.

255
19:13.165 --> 19:16.737
I never felt any affection
for it and often hated it.

256
19:18.010 --> 19:19.474
I feel kind of bad.

257
19:20.324 --> 19:22.149
You're a girl, just as I am,

258
19:22.741 --> 19:28.154
but when you were King Arthur, you never had the
luxury of enjoying simple things like this, did you?

259
19:30.117 --> 19:31.787
So, what about your desires?

260
19:31.994 --> 19:36.682
Surely, you would have much preferred to have
Kiritsugu escort you around town today, right?

261
19:37.468 --> 19:40.190
Of course I would, but he couldn't.

262
19:40.854 --> 19:43.027
It would only cause him pain and suffering.

263
19:44.668 --> 19:48.026
Does Kiritsugu not enjoy the time he spends with you?

264
19:49.681 --> 19:52.218
When he's happy, for some reason,

265
19:52.651 --> 19:54.504
it seems to cause him pain.

266
20:05.991 --> 20:07.250
An enemy servant?

267
20:07.998 --> 20:12.927
Yes, making its presence known from the
shadows, 100 meters ahead.

268
20:13.451 --> 20:16.510
It appears to be inviting us over to go and see it.

269
20:17.121 --> 20:21.089
How thoughtful; it wishes
to decide on a battlefield.

270
20:21.461 --> 20:23.528
Shall we take it up on its invitation?

271
20:24.988 --> 20:26.496
I'd like nothing better.

272
20:34.509 --> 20:39.130
Come on, Rider,
let's get down from here right now!

273
20:39.221 --> 20:40.288
Take me down!

274
20:41.911 --> 20:42.754
But why?

275
20:42.931 --> 20:46.247
This is a nearly perfect vantage
point to survey the whole land.

276
20:46.494 --> 20:47.710
I'm leaving!

277
20:47.783 --> 20:48.516
No, wait!

278
20:48.591 --> 20:51.003
Take me back down, I can't handle this!

279
20:51.043 --> 20:52.495
Oh, calm yourself.

280
20:53.035 --> 20:55.337
Waiting is a large part of war.

281
20:55.917 --> 20:59.190
I wanna go... I wanna go back to England.

282
20:59.487 --> 21:02.040
I told you not to be in such a damn hurry.

283
21:02.166 --> 21:05.679
You see, things have finally begun to unfold out there.

284
21:08.514 --> 21:10.454
This is going to be a lot of fun!

285
21:16.631 --> 21:17.313
Welcome.

286
21:18.617 --> 21:21.934
I have spent the entire day
searching the city for a worthy foe.

287
21:22.837 --> 21:26.668
Everyone just slinks away, hiding in their little holes.

288
21:27.427 --> 21:30.643
You, alone, have accepted my offer.

289
21:32.473 --> 21:34.573
That pure energy surrounding you;

290
21:35.111 --> 21:38.094
you are the servant called Saber, I presume?

291
21:38.564 --> 21:42.744
Indeed, I am, and I presume that you
are the one that's called Lancer?

292
21:44.463 --> 21:50.316
Being unable to honorably name myself to my opponent
in combat troubles me more than I can describe.

293
21:50.420 --> 21:53.320
I harbor an enormous dislike of these rules.

294
22:10.744 --> 22:13.058
Saber, please...be careful.

295
22:13.380 --> 22:16.837
I can use my healing magic to
act as combat support for you.

296
22:17.321 --> 22:18.959
But, more than that, Saber... 

297
22:19.170 --> 22:20.825
Just leave Lancer to me.

298
22:21.450 --> 22:25.404
It troubles me that his master is in
hiding and has not yet shown himself.

299
22:25.695 --> 22:27.554
Perhaps they plot something.

300
22:28.047 --> 22:29.245
Watch yourself.

301
22:30.634 --> 22:35.243
And, Irisviel, from this point on,
I entrust you to watch my back.

302
22:35.531 --> 22:37.358
Very well, I will, Saber.

303
22:37.557 --> 22:39.317
Grant me victory in this fight.

304
22:39.530 --> 22:42.023
I will, without fail.
