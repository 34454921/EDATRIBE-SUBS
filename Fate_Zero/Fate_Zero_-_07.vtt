00:04.873 --> 00:05.730
This way, sir.

2
00:09.713 --> 00:10.751
What is that?

3
00:14.043 --> 00:16.147
All of you, return to your post.

4
00:17.148 --> 00:19.753
Looks like an enormous ball of mercury doesn't it?

5
00:19.960 --> 00:22.263
It's almost as if the damn thing is alive.

6
00:28.337 --> 00:29.105
I need to get this out of here...

7
00:29.130 --> 00:30.773
What's the matter, is something wrong?

8
00:30.773 --> 00:31.853
I need to get this out of here,

9
00:31.853 --> 00:33.403
I need to get this out of here.

10
00:33.403 --> 00:34.058
Sir?

11
00:34.280 --> 00:36.034
Load that thing onto the truck!

12
00:36.177 --> 00:37.244
Quickly!

13
02:08.522 --> 02:12.781
I'm afraid I must inform you
that the Grail War is in grave peril.

14
02:13.267 --> 02:18.318
We have identified Caster's master as the
person behind the recent kidnappings in Fuyuki,

15
02:18.471 --> 02:20.726
a disturbing revelation, indeed.

16
02:21.572 --> 02:25.866
Thus, in accordance with the emergency powers
granted to me as overseer,

17
02:26.183 --> 02:28.940
I am temporarily altering the rules of the Grail War.

18
02:29.291 --> 02:33.783
Masters are to hereby cease all
ongoing combat in pursuit of the grail

19
02:33.902 --> 02:36.929
and focus on the elimination of Caster instead.

20
02:37.677 --> 02:41.477
And the one who succeeds in
defeating Caster and his master

21
02:41.610 --> 02:45.177
will receive an additional
Command Seal as their reward.

22
02:45.892 --> 02:51.851
These are the unused Command Seals left behind
by the fallen masters of past grail wars.

23
02:52.192 --> 02:56.826
One of them should prove to be of
immeasurable value to whoever receives it.

24
02:57.526 --> 03:00.788
Once Caster's destruction has been positively confirmed,

25
03:00.914 --> 03:04.459
the Holy Grail War will
recommence until a victor emerges.

26
03:04.857 --> 03:07.256
Now then, if anyone has questions,

27
03:07.492 --> 03:08.932
please ask them now.

28
03:09.671 --> 03:14.541
But, of course, that offer is limited to those
who can actually speak in human languages.

29
03:19.212 --> 03:20.507
Well played, Father.

30
03:20.929 --> 03:25.020
Now all the masters will do whatever they
can to hunt him down and destroy him.

31
03:25.302 --> 03:30.335
There were five familiars gathered at the
church for my announcement, which means that...

32
03:30.733 --> 03:36.762
Which means that the elusive missing master
Lord El‐Melloi is still very much alive.

33
03:36.902 --> 03:37.787
Indeed.

34
03:38.011 --> 03:40.846
And the offer of a Command Seal as the reward

35
03:41.112 --> 03:42.482
should draw him out

36
03:42.546 --> 03:45.072
given that he's already used one of his.

37
03:45.242 --> 03:48.543
Of course, the other masters will be drawn out as well.

38
03:48.958 --> 03:51.658
They'll seek to keep the Command Seal from the rest

39
03:51.888 --> 03:54.956
by making certain they can claim it for themselves.

40
03:55.582 --> 03:59.615
That's true, but it also means
that the master who wins the seal

41
03:59.872 --> 04:02.471
will gain a formidable
advantage over the others.

42
04:02.598 --> 04:04.538
Naturally, it's not ideal.

43
04:04.882 --> 04:07.111
Once Caster has been thoroughly weakened

44
04:07.343 --> 04:10.551
and is on the run from all the
other masters who are chasing him,

45
04:10.957 --> 04:15.183
Archer must be the one to deal the final blow.

46
04:16.790 --> 04:17.925
Um...

47
04:18.540 --> 04:20.874
Excuse me, is this the Mackenzie residence?

48
04:21.009 --> 04:22.167
I have a delivery.

49
04:22.271 --> 04:25.867
Yes, that is the name of this domicile's residents.

50
04:26.492 --> 04:31.594
Well, then, might there be a Mr. Iskandar,
King of Conquerors here?

51
04:31.662 --> 04:33.223
That would be me.

52
04:33.282 --> 04:34.916
I see, right.

53
04:35.122 --> 04:36.324
I should've known.

54
04:37.462 --> 04:40.772
Uh, could I have your signature on this receipt here?

55
04:40.962 --> 04:42.099
My signature?

56
04:42.212 --> 04:43.370
Very well.

57
04:46.044 --> 04:47.667
You have my thanks.

58
04:48.472 --> 04:51.806
Well, thank you very much for your business, sir.

59
04:56.019 --> 04:58.949
To have the entire world emblazoned across my chest.

60
04:59.522 --> 05:01.022
What a great feeling!

61
05:03.250 --> 05:05.080
Wait, why are you dressed like that?

62
05:05.218 --> 05:07.228
The package I was awaiting arrived.

63
05:07.626 --> 05:09.666
So you went outside the house?

64
05:09.782 --> 05:13.607
Ta‐da, I merely tried out that
mail‐order thing I heard about.

65
05:13.712 --> 05:16.460
But I told you that you were
never to leave the second floor!

66
05:16.576 --> 05:21.458
If the residents are not at home and you are off
somewhere all day occupied with your familiar,

67
05:21.672 --> 05:23.628
who else is there to answer the door?

68
05:23.922 --> 05:25.256
I had no choice.

69
05:25.471 --> 05:29.117
A summons to appear by the Holy
Church is a big deal and I had to go.

70
05:29.172 --> 05:30.570
Don't be so grouchy.

71
05:30.972 --> 05:32.841
After seeing Saber last night,

72
05:33.012 --> 05:34.684
I came to a realization.

73
05:35.182 --> 05:40.984
If one wears modern attire, there should be no
issue whatsoever with going outside the domicile.

74
05:41.312 --> 05:42.321
Hey, wait!

75
05:42.522 --> 05:43.457
Stop!

76
05:43.717 --> 05:46.238
At least put on some pants before you go out!

77
05:46.982 --> 05:48.350
Oh, yes, leggings.

78
05:49.444 --> 05:52.951
That's true, I forgot.
Everyone in this land wears them.

79
05:53.622 --> 05:54.857
Do I have to wear them?

80
05:54.936 --> 05:56.630
Yes, of course you have to!

81
05:56.662 --> 05:58.242
And just to be perfectly clear,

82
05:58.319 --> 06:01.596
I'm definitely not going to make
a special trip all the way to town

83
06:01.628 --> 06:04.614
just to buy you a pair of
triple XL pants, understand?

84
06:04.752 --> 06:05.902
You won't, why?

85
06:06.079 --> 06:10.105
Boy, would you actually stand in the way
of my triumphant conquest of the world?

86
06:10.248 --> 06:12.721
You conquering the world and
whether or not you have pants have

87
06:12.746 --> 06:15.602
nothing, not even the slightest
thing to do with each other!

88
06:15.713 --> 06:18.502
Before you start planning to go screwing around outside,

89
06:18.591 --> 06:21.672
why don't you go out and do your job
and beat one of the other servants?

90
06:21.926 --> 06:24.484
Then I'll buy your pants or anything else you want.

91
06:24.602 --> 06:25.375
Very well.

92
06:25.812 --> 06:26.908
I understand.

93
06:27.232 --> 06:30.435
Do you swear that once I defeat
one of the other servants

94
06:30.508 --> 06:34.757
you will go and buy me a modern pair
of pants so that I can go outside?

95
06:35.072 --> 06:36.496
Unbelievable.

96
06:36.776 --> 06:40.557
You really want to put on modern clothes
and go walking outside that much?

97
06:40.646 --> 06:43.141
The King of Knights was walking around outside.

98
06:43.275 --> 06:45.888
I simply cannot allow myself to be undone.

99
06:46.422 --> 06:48.445
I like the design on this shirt.

100
06:48.597 --> 06:51.162
It is fitting attire for a strong ruler.

101
06:51.545 --> 06:54.777
Look, we have to go find and defeat Caster too.

102
06:55.279 --> 06:57.130
What the hell are we doing?

103
06:58.641 --> 07:00.952
There is a powerful barrier over Mount Enzo

104
07:01.094 --> 07:02.866
with Ryuudou Temple at its center.

105
07:03.502 --> 07:06.521
Because of that,
except for natural spirits like servants,

106
07:06.711 --> 07:09.205
anything can enter only via the temple path.

107
07:10.295 --> 07:12.448
Keep that in mind as you're using Saber.

108
07:13.267 --> 07:15.808
There are three other spots
where the ley lines converge:

109
07:15.966 --> 07:17.675
Tohsaka Manor, Fuyuki Chapel,

110
07:17.881 --> 07:21.591
and this new residential area, east of the city center.

111
07:22.109 --> 07:25.962
Consequently, this means that there
are four locations in Fuyuki

112
07:26.044 --> 07:29.736
that have all the spiritual characteristics
needed for the grail to appear.

113
07:30.331 --> 07:31.889
In the war's second phase,

114
07:32.065 --> 07:34.519
when there are fewer servants left in the fight,

115
07:34.814 --> 07:36.856
we'll have to secure one of these spots

116
07:36.881 --> 07:39.016
as our base of operations, won't we?

117
07:39.091 --> 07:40.276
Yes, that's correct.

118
07:40.455 --> 07:42.924
Well, that just about covers the lay of the land.

119
07:43.141 --> 07:44.442
Are there any questions?

120
07:45.174 --> 07:47.270
Is there anything that you aren't clear on?

121
07:47.431 --> 07:48.955
I understand perfectly.

122
07:49.718 --> 07:51.402
It was an adequate explanation.

123
07:52.579 --> 07:56.931
Kiritsugu, can we assume that all the
other masters will go after Caster?

124
07:57.321 --> 07:58.582
It's a safe bet.

125
07:59.071 --> 08:02.699
However, we have an advantage
as far as Caster is concerned.

126
08:03.411 --> 08:04.748
In his madness,

127
08:05.346 --> 08:08.712
he believes that our Saber is actually his Jeanne d'Arc

128
08:09.001 --> 08:10.429
which is to our benefit.

129
08:10.751 --> 08:13.193
We need only wait for him to come to us.

130
08:13.541 --> 08:15.608
But, master, that is not enough.

131
08:15.856 --> 08:17.786
His evil deeds must be punished.

132
08:17.984 --> 08:19.756
We should take the fight straight to him

133
08:19.867 --> 08:21.688
before he can do any more damage.

134
08:25.601 --> 08:29.314
Iri, do you have a handle on
this forest's barrier spells?

135
08:29.449 --> 08:31.205
Yes, I do, however,

136
08:31.491 --> 08:35.249
our real problem is the unbreakable
curse on Saber's left hand.

137
08:35.972 --> 08:39.611
Eighteen hours have already passed
since your defeat of Canaan,

138
08:40.010 --> 08:43.265
but Saber's wound has still yet to heal.

139
08:44.201 --> 08:46.237
Lancer must still be alive.

140
08:46.802 --> 08:52.219
Shouldn't we go find and defeat Lancer first so we
can face a battle with Caster at our full strength?

141
08:52.433 --> 08:53.999
That isn't necessary.

142
08:54.651 --> 08:59.856
You just need to use your knowledge of the area
to confuse the enemy, keeping Saber moving around.

143
09:01.671 --> 09:03.698
You won't have her fight Caster?

144
09:04.128 --> 09:06.852
No, someone else will deal with him even if we don't.

145
09:07.131 --> 09:12.023
The masters and servants hunting Caster in
a frenzy will make excellent targets for us.

146
09:12.981 --> 09:15.783
I'll attack from their flanks and take them out.

147
09:16.336 --> 09:18.317
Master, you can't.

148
09:18.660 --> 09:21.725
To what depths do you intend to sink in your pursuit?

149
09:21.941 --> 09:24.505
You do insult to heroic spirits.

150
09:24.781 --> 09:27.159
Why do you not allow me to go out and fight?

151
09:27.286 --> 09:29.533
Do you mean to imply that you cannot trust me,

152
09:29.661 --> 09:31.108
your own servant?

153
09:32.526 --> 09:35.295
There's a truce against everyone
but Caster, isn't there?

154
09:35.600 --> 09:36.836
It'll be fine.

155
09:37.501 --> 09:40.212
This overseer of ours can't be trusted.

156
09:40.421 --> 09:44.709
He harbors Assassin's master in his church
and doesn't say anything about it to anyone.

157
09:45.306 --> 09:47.458
He may also be working with Tohsaka.

158
09:47.721 --> 09:49.905
We should be skeptical of his actions.

159
09:50.641 --> 09:52.565
All right, dismissed.

160
09:58.821 --> 09:59.774
Kiritsugu.

161
10:03.765 --> 10:04.547
If...

162
10:06.063 --> 10:07.010
If I...

163
10:08.006 --> 10:12.024
If I decided to abandon everything
and simply run away from all of this,

164
10:12.541 --> 10:16.400
Iri, would you consider coming with me?

165
10:16.711 --> 10:18.243
But what about Illya?

166
10:18.461 --> 10:20.627
She's still waiting back at our castle.

167
10:21.131 --> 10:24.266
I'd return for her, killing anyone in our way,

168
10:24.461 --> 10:26.077
and then I would just...

169
10:27.261 --> 10:28.674
I'd give all I have

170
10:28.955 --> 10:31.321
for you and Illya, and no one else!

171
10:32.641 --> 10:34.656
Could we really get away?

172
10:34.758 --> 10:37.435
We could escape if we go now!

173
10:39.061 --> 10:40.024
You're lying.

174
10:40.731 --> 10:41.820
That's a lie.

175
10:43.781 --> 10:45.783
You could never run away from this.

176
10:46.321 --> 10:48.040
You would never forgive yourself

177
10:48.241 --> 10:50.447
for abandoning the Holy Grail,

178
10:51.125 --> 10:53.030
for failing to save the world.

179
10:53.871 --> 10:57.888
You would be riddled with guilt,
and as your first and final accuser,

180
10:58.751 --> 11:01.010
you would eventually kill yourself.

181
11:03.421 --> 11:04.667
I'm scared.

182
11:06.266 --> 11:09.616
He... Kirei Kotomine is after me.

183
11:10.931 --> 11:12.182
Maiya told me.

184
11:12.801 --> 11:15.153
He used Canaan as bait to draw me out.

185
11:15.811 --> 11:17.735
He anticipated my actions.

186
11:18.771 --> 11:20.786
I've already sacrificed you, Iri,

187
11:21.101 --> 11:22.764
and I've left Illya behind,

188
11:23.111 --> 11:26.563
but the most dangerous of them all
has already set his sights on me,

189
11:26.952 --> 11:29.994
the one that I had hoped
to never cross paths with!

190
11:32.741 --> 11:34.698
I won't allow you to fight alone.

191
11:35.291 --> 11:38.416
I will protect you, and Saber will, too,

192
11:38.751 --> 11:41.848
and also Maiya is here.

193
11:46.075 --> 11:47.037
Kiritsugu.

194
11:49.019 --> 11:49.929
An attack.

195
11:51.181 --> 11:53.519
We're lucky I hadn't sent Maiya out yet.

196
11:54.471 --> 11:56.197
We can mount an all‐out defense.

197
11:59.061 --> 12:03.037
Iri, find us a remote‐viewing crystal ball.

198
12:09.236 --> 12:10.306
There they are.

199
12:11.486 --> 12:12.371
Irisviel.

200
12:13.026 --> 12:14.739
He's trying to lure us out.

201
12:14.946 --> 12:17.733
It looks like he has hostages.

202
12:17.996 --> 12:20.745
I'll have to go out there and
do what I can to save them.

203
12:25.346 --> 12:26.935
He knows that we're watching him.

204
12:27.102 --> 12:32.589
Just as I promised you last night, I,
Gilles de Rais, have come for you, my darling.

205
12:32.716 --> 12:38.502
I wish to see you, fair Jeanne, my enchanting
and radiantly beautiful holy virgin of my dreams.

206
12:39.030 --> 12:39.860
Irisviel.

207
12:39.886 --> 12:42.291
You may take your time if you wish.

208
12:42.507 --> 12:48.575
I have come fully prepared for a lengthy wait, and will
be as attentive and patient as you need for me to be.

209
12:49.986 --> 12:53.558
Now, children, it's time for
us to play some hide‐and‐seek.

210
12:53.856 --> 12:54.971
The rules are simple.

211
12:55.156 --> 12:56.497
You need only to elude me.

212
12:57.114 --> 12:58.886
But if I find you...

213
12:59.624 --> 13:00.653
No, don't!

214
13:05.794 --> 13:06.964
Run, children.

215
13:07.096 --> 13:09.376
When I count to a hundred, the chase begins.

216
13:09.501 --> 13:14.817
Well, Jeanne, how long do you think it will
take for me to catch them all and win the game?

217
13:19.806 --> 13:20.783
Saber, go!

218
13:20.942 --> 13:22.206
Defeat Caster!

219
13:22.476 --> 13:23.239
Yes!

220
13:31.605 --> 13:32.344
Huh?

221
13:47.591 --> 13:50.029
Welcome, fair Jeanne.

222
13:50.394 --> 13:52.904
How do you like this horrible sight?

223
13:52.999 --> 13:54.806
Does it not pain you?

224
13:57.386 --> 13:59.913
Do you despise me, Jeanne?

225
14:00.886 --> 14:03.121
Yes, I'm sure you must.

226
14:03.451 --> 14:07.741
I'm certain you'll never forgive
me for turning from God's love.

227
14:07.938 --> 14:10.568
Unhand the child, monster!

228
14:11.316 --> 14:19.866
Jeanne, if you so dearly wish to save the boy, then,
child, you should rejoice and be exceedingly glad.

229
14:20.057 --> 14:24.743
God's devout messenger says that she will save
you from the fate of your departed friend.

230
14:30.032 --> 14:31.408
It's dangerous here.

231
14:31.586 --> 14:33.767
Now, you need to run.

232
14:34.365 --> 14:37.255
Just follow this path and you'll find a castle.

233
14:53.218 --> 14:56.212
Ha‐ha, do you not remember what I told you?

234
14:56.526 --> 14:59.016
I said that the very next time we would meet

235
14:59.223 --> 15:01.185
I would be prepared for you.

236
15:01.986 --> 15:03.148
Very well.

237
15:03.666 --> 15:05.952
My fight with you is no longer over.

238
15:06.222 --> 15:07.360
The Grail!

239
15:16.339 --> 15:20.563
Oh, my fair Jeanne, how noble, how beautiful!

240
15:20.666 --> 15:25.069
Oh, holy virgin,
even God's beauty pales before you.

241
15:25.163 --> 15:28.976
Caster, I take up my sword solely to destroy you!

242
15:29.097 --> 15:30.036
Prepare!

243
15:50.666 --> 15:52.885
If only I could use my left hand.

244
15:53.624 --> 15:56.562
Even Caster's mana isn't infinite.

245
15:57.413 --> 15:59.389
If she can last until it runs out,

246
15:59.963 --> 16:03.388
Saber can with this battle, right, Kiritsugu?

247
16:03.451 --> 16:08.067
More importantly, there's still no sign
of other masters entering the forest.

248
16:08.783 --> 16:12.325
Maiya, take Iri and get away from the castle

249
16:13.080 --> 16:14.995
in the opposite direction of the fight.

250
16:16.099 --> 16:18.066
But why can't I just remain here?

251
16:18.307 --> 16:21.677
With Saber fighting away from you,
it simply isn't safe for you here.

252
16:22.335 --> 16:25.936
At least one of the other masters is
certain to have had the same idea.

253
16:28.129 --> 16:29.327
All right, I'll go.

254
16:32.300 --> 16:34.057
What's wrong, Iri?

255
16:34.788 --> 16:37.996
It appears that another one has arrived.

256
16:41.942 --> 16:43.402
How is this?

257
16:43.622 --> 16:45.719
Is there no end to his mana?

258
16:46.756 --> 16:47.967
Impossible.

259
16:48.096 --> 16:50.056
The source of his mana is...

260
16:50.494 --> 16:52.781
So that book is your Noble Phantasm?

261
16:52.932 --> 16:57.032
That's right, the grimoire left to
me by the legendary teacher, Prelati,

262
16:57.381 --> 17:01.331
gives me the ample means to command
a demonic legion to do my will.

263
17:01.504 --> 17:03.594
What do you think, my fair Jeanne?

264
17:03.784 --> 17:05.906
It brings back memories, doesn't it?

265
17:06.032 --> 17:08.196
Everything is just as it was then.

266
17:08.264 --> 17:14.342
Your indomitable warrior spirit and noble bearing
proves you to be none other than Jeanne d'Arc!

267
17:14.616 --> 17:18.451
So why, fair Jeanne,
why do you not awaken to the truth of this?

268
17:18.769 --> 17:22.088
Do you still believe in God's grace even now?

269
17:22.374 --> 17:26.147
Faced with mortal peril,
you still believe a miracle will save you?

270
17:26.491 --> 17:30.740
How terribly tragic.
Have you forgotten the Battle of Compiègne?

271
17:30.938 --> 17:36.531
Even after that awful humiliation,
you still chose to remain God's puppet!

272
17:49.446 --> 17:50.756
Ah!

273
17:54.536 --> 17:56.085
Rather pathetic.

274
17:56.318 --> 17:59.961
Such swordsmanship is unworthy
of the title King of Knights.

275
18:00.376 --> 18:00.892
Hmm.

276
18:01.456 --> 18:02.861
Who are you?

277
18:02.956 --> 18:06.191
And who gave you leave to
interfere with our private affair?

278
18:06.524 --> 18:09.202
Yes, well, that is my question to you, monster.

279
18:09.663 --> 18:12.821
It will be my lance alone that takes Saber's life.

280
18:12.975 --> 18:15.382
Ah, no, it was my prayer!

281
18:15.501 --> 18:18.655
It was my Holy Grail that brought her back to life!

282
18:18.896 --> 18:21.146
She is mine, intruder.

283
18:21.269 --> 18:26.274
Every scrap of flesh, every drop of
blood, even her very soul belongs to me!

284
18:26.299 --> 18:31.503
Listen, Caster, I am not gonna comment
on your bizarre notion of romance here.

285
18:31.718 --> 18:35.116
So if you really believe that you're
gonna make Saber yours here today,

286
18:35.237 --> 18:36.651
then go ahead and try it,

287
18:37.076 --> 18:43.469
but know that I, Diarmuid, will never allow you
to defeat a crippled Saber in any sort of battle

288
18:43.494 --> 18:44.876
before I can!

289
18:46.330 --> 18:48.117
You came to help?

290
18:48.682 --> 18:50.420
Don't get the wrong idea.

291
18:51.032 --> 18:55.306
The only thing that brought me here today
was the order to find and defeat Caster.

292
18:55.734 --> 19:00.018
And, so, I believe cooperation
is our best option, right?

293
19:00.806 --> 19:01.607
Mmhmm.

294
19:03.244 --> 19:05.142
Just to be perfectly clear, Lancer,

295
19:05.731 --> 19:09.482
right now, I could kill a hundred of
those things with just my left arm.

296
19:09.666 --> 19:12.969
Hmm, a mere hundred of them is child's play.

297
19:15.527 --> 19:16.917
You will pay.

298
19:17.182 --> 19:20.482
Don't be conceited, you savage!

299
19:22.768 --> 19:25.237
Fervor, mei sanguis.

300
19:34.015 --> 19:36.191
Kayneth El‐Melloi has arrived,

301
19:36.405 --> 19:38.804
the ninth patriarch of the Archibald family.

302
19:39.337 --> 19:43.682
Mage of the Einzbern, come forth and let
us duel for possession of the Holy Grail

303
19:43.856 --> 19:45.922
with our lives and our sacred honor.

304
20:17.267 --> 20:19.569
Mechanical traps, of all things.

305
20:19.952 --> 20:22.453
Have you fallen so low, Einzbern?

306
20:22.907 --> 20:27.116
Very well, then this is no longer a
duel, but an extermination.

307
20:36.736 --> 20:37.685
I see.

308
20:38.591 --> 20:40.051
Automated probes.

309
20:47.401 --> 20:49.876
I found you, pathetic rat.

310
20:54.426 --> 20:55.536
Now scalp!

311
20:57.334 --> 20:59.539
Time alter, double accelerate.

312
21:05.436 --> 21:06.261
Huh?

313
21:06.936 --> 21:07.612
Oh.

314
21:08.097 --> 21:14.507
He manipulated the flow of time to greatly accelerate
himself by using his own body as a reality marble.

315
21:14.832 --> 21:17.733
It seems that he knows a little magic after all.

316
21:17.955 --> 21:24.216
Still, only a miserable, little coward would depend
on petty tricks after being trained as a mage.

317
21:24.597 --> 21:27.547
Perhaps dying will teach him his place.

318
21:29.357 --> 21:30.969
Ire sanctio.

319
21:33.782 --> 21:38.795
If he's manipulating his inner time,
it must be placing enormous stress on his body.

320
21:42.176 --> 21:43.277
I found him.

321
21:44.025 --> 21:47.566
Now then, how far can you run as exhausted as you are?

322
21:58.026 --> 22:00.810
Time alter, triple stagnate.

323
22:07.932 --> 22:09.843
These things don't have eyes.

324
22:10.751 --> 22:13.483
If I can slow my internal time to a third

325
22:14.079 --> 22:17.742
and lower my pulse and
respiration as far as they can go,

326
22:18.608 --> 22:20.330
they can't sense me.

327
22:33.688 --> 22:34.537
Kayneth!

328
22:37.406 --> 22:38.407
You're a fool!

329
22:38.526 --> 22:40.052
It's a waste of time.

330
22:45.406 --> 22:46.835
Hmm.
