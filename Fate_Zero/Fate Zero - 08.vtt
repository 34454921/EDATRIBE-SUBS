1
00:06.827 --> 00:07.447
Madam?

2
00:07.472 --> 00:08.226
Huh?

3
00:10.013 --> 00:10.983
Please hurry.

4
00:18.967 --> 00:19.902
Madam?

5
00:20.539 --> 00:22.516
Another intruder has just arrived.

6
00:22.794 --> 00:25.163
They're waiting for us in the direction we're headed.

7
00:25.758 --> 00:27.856
We'll run into them if we go this way.

8
00:28.286 --> 00:29.151
Understood.

9
00:29.690 --> 00:31.843
Let's circle around to the north side then.

10
00:35.357 --> 00:36.078
Madam?

11
00:36.382 --> 00:38.009
The one who is coming is...

12
00:40.163 --> 00:41.591
Kirei Kotomine.

13
02:16.887 --> 02:18.534
Kirei Kotomine.

14
02:20.663 --> 02:24.291
Maiya, the orders that were given to you by Kiritsugu

15
02:24.637 --> 02:26.991
were to protect me from harm, right?

16
02:27.292 --> 02:28.095
Yes.

17
02:29.501 --> 02:31.004
‐But... ‐But what?

18
02:31.857 --> 02:33.935
We mustn't let him get to Kiritsugu,

19
02:34.147 --> 02:36.303
no matter what we have to do to stop him.

20
02:37.567 --> 02:39.211
Isn't that what you're thinking?

21
02:42.617 --> 02:44.763
Madam, how did you...

22
02:44.941 --> 02:46.272
What a coincidence.

23
02:46.657 --> 02:48.737
I was thinking the very same thing.

24
02:49.077 --> 02:52.216
Maiya, Kirei Kotomine

25
02:52.417 --> 02:54.545
represents the most dangerous threat

26
02:54.743 --> 02:57.118
that Kiritsugu has ever had to face.

27
02:58.152 --> 03:00.510
You and I are going to hold him off here.

28
03:01.137 --> 03:02.710
Understood, Maiya?

29
03:04.767 --> 03:06.072
I apologize.

30
03:06.387 --> 03:09.551
But, please prepare yourself, madam.

31
03:09.767 --> 03:10.585
I will.

32
03:11.147 --> 03:12.913
Please don't worry about me.

33
03:13.397 --> 03:15.527
Do whatever you think you have to do,

34
03:16.067 --> 03:18.364
what you believe to be necessary to win,

35
03:18.697 --> 03:20.968
and not what Kiritsugu ordered you to do.

36
03:21.117 --> 03:21.890
Right.

37
03:24.617 --> 03:25.562
What's funny?

38
03:27.657 --> 03:31.391
Isn't the human heart a funny thing?

39
03:41.297 --> 03:45.574
Hmm, you repeat an attack you
know to be absolutely futile.

40
04:00.911 --> 04:01.703
Scalp!

41
04:17.852 --> 04:22.074
He was somehow able to breach Volumen
Hydragyrum's autonomous defense?

42
04:22.880 --> 04:24.052
He couldn't have.

43
04:24.257 --> 04:28.866
His ineffective childish attack simply
rolled me into lowering my guard!

44
04:29.767 --> 04:34.826
I shall take steps to provide for a much
swifter, more efficient defense from now on.

45
04:36.623 --> 04:39.053
You're disgrace to mages everywhere,

46
04:39.147 --> 04:40.991
you piece of lowborn trash!

47
04:41.567 --> 04:43.382
For spilling my blood,

48
04:44.407 --> 04:46.123
you will pay with your life.

49
04:51.657 --> 04:54.211
He knows exactly how powerful this is now.

50
04:54.667 --> 04:56.579
It's not going to work on him twice.

51
04:57.741 --> 05:01.217
Next time, he'll channel all his mana into his defense.

52
05:02.757 --> 05:06.827
Yes, that exactly what I need him to do.

53
05:21.456 --> 05:22.050
Huh?

54
05:33.157 --> 05:33.968
An illusion?

55
05:51.517 --> 05:52.376
Maiya, no!

56
06:20.837 --> 06:23.297
Madam, please don't.

57
06:24.497 --> 06:27.507
Woman, this may come as a surprise to you,

58
06:27.880 --> 06:31.393
but I haven't come here to this
place in order to defeat you.

59
06:31.894 --> 06:35.103
I'm well aware of that, Kirei Kotomine.

60
06:36.477 --> 06:40.131
I know what you desire, but I will not allow it.

61
06:40.791 --> 06:44.088
You will never reach Kiritsugu Emiya tonight or ever!

62
06:44.817 --> 06:46.099
We will stop you...

63
06:47.277 --> 06:48.068
...right here.

64
06:48.242 --> 06:49.157
Madam!

65
06:49.237 --> 06:50.867
He's a skilled executioner!

66
06:50.929 --> 06:52.700
An expert at hunting mages!

67
06:52.876 --> 06:55.584
Regular magic won't be enough to stop him!

68
06:58.787 --> 07:02.845
Kiritsugu taught me a lot more than how to drive a car!

69
07:03.547 --> 07:09.028
He taught me to live and to survive!
Shape ist Leben!

70
07:37.787 --> 07:38.639
Look out!

71
07:38.664 --> 07:39.848
Not so fast!

72
07:52.717 --> 07:53.624
Maiya!

73
07:55.467 --> 07:56.570
Finish him!

74
08:08.067 --> 08:09.354
It can't be.

75
08:38.704 --> 08:39.426
Hm.

76
08:49.107 --> 08:50.947
You bastard... ah!

77
09:01.599 --> 09:02.791
I'm honestly stunned

78
09:03.340 --> 09:06.000
that we've made so little progress with these things.

79
09:06.679 --> 09:09.170
It's that grimoire, Lancer.

80
09:10.019 --> 09:12.237
As long as he holds that Noble Phantasm,

81
09:12.399 --> 09:14.167
our situation will not improve.

82
09:14.351 --> 09:16.551
I see, so that's his secret.

83
09:17.307 --> 09:23.232
Of course, if you plan to go over and knock the book
from that pale freak's hands, you've got a problem.

84
09:23.502 --> 09:26.212
You'll need to get pass his big wall of monsters first.

85
09:26.619 --> 09:29.588
Well, then, what say you to taking in

86
09:29.683 --> 09:31.026
all‐or‐nothing gamble?

87
09:31.344 --> 09:36.622
It feels a bit shameful, but there's no glory
in simply fighting these ugly things.

88
09:36.996 --> 09:39.881
Very well, count me in, Saber.

89
09:40.429 --> 09:41.851
I shall clear a path for you.

90
09:42.259 --> 09:44.179
We will have but one chance at this.

91
09:44.585 --> 09:47.570
Lancer, can you run on the wind?

92
09:48.429 --> 09:49.327
I understand.

93
09:49.729 --> 09:51.074
It's child's play.

94
09:51.383 --> 09:52.441
How delightful!

95
09:52.729 --> 09:54.237
Have you two said your prayers?

96
09:54.479 --> 09:57.733
Tremble down to your soul!
Sink into despair!

97
09:57.963 --> 10:03.905
Superior skill can only defeat so many before
being completely overwhelmed by sheer numbers.

98
10:06.539 --> 10:08.474
It must be humiliating!

99
10:08.789 --> 10:10.096
You will die!

100
10:10.191 --> 10:14.870
Suffocated under a horde of monsters
that know nothing of honor or glory!

101
10:14.957 --> 10:18.406
There can be no greater disgrace for a hero!

102
10:19.549 --> 10:21.901
Oh, that beautiful face of yours.

103
10:22.044 --> 10:26.426
Make it twist and contort in pain for me, Jeanne!

104
10:30.099 --> 10:32.441
Strike Air!

105
10:38.224 --> 10:38.623
Ah!

106
10:40.926 --> 10:43.016
Prepare to die!

107
10:45.869 --> 10:48.251
Strike him, Gae Dearg!

108
10:49.159 --> 10:50.356
Ahh!

109
11:13.206 --> 11:14.390
Damn you.

110
11:14.939 --> 11:17.940
Damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you, damn you!

111
11:18.109 --> 11:20.347
Damn you!

112
11:22.199 --> 11:23.216
Did you like that?

113
11:23.489 --> 11:25.782
Had Saber had the use of her left hand,

114
11:26.213 --> 11:28.710
well, you would've experienced the same.

115
11:30.869 --> 11:32.148
Prepare to die...

116
11:34.166 --> 11:35.007
...monster.

117
11:51.389 --> 11:52.487
Pathetic.

118
11:52.821 --> 11:58.538
I didn't come here and join the Holy Grail War
only to fight in this ridiculous sort of battle!

119
12:09.239 --> 12:10.385
Where is he?

120
12:10.579 --> 12:11.402
Find him.

121
12:18.379 --> 12:19.705
There you are...

122
12:21.129 --> 12:23.256
...you skulking little rat.

123
12:27.542 --> 12:33.799
Surely you don't expect the same trick to work
on me a second time, do you, lowborn scum?

124
12:35.419 --> 12:41.521
The fact that you succeeded in landing a single
blow wasn't due to any great strategy of yours.

125
12:41.689 --> 12:42.609
It was a fluke.

126
12:42.609 --> 12:44.484
A stroke of luck, plain and simple.

127
12:44.762 --> 12:46.978
Now I'm going to teach you the difference.

128
12:47.193 --> 12:49.561
I shan't let you die easily.

129
12:49.775 --> 12:53.208
I shall use healing magic to
regenerate your heart and lungs

130
12:53.233 --> 12:56.186
while I rend every millimeter
of your lowborn flesh.

131
12:56.345 --> 12:58.789
In excruciating pain and despair,

132
12:58.886 --> 13:00.768
you will die as you suffer.

133
13:01.030 --> 13:03.434
And while you die, you will curse them,

134
13:03.666 --> 13:06.440
you will curse the cowardice of those who hired you.

135
13:06.631 --> 13:10.341
You will curse the Einzbern for
making a mockery of the Grail War!

136
13:11.469 --> 13:12.811
Insolent fool!

137
13:13.009 --> 13:14.559
Fervor, mei sanguis!

138
13:16.929 --> 13:17.546
Hm.

139
13:22.474 --> 13:24.905
I knew you'd do that, scum.

140
13:30.239 --> 13:30.911
Hm.

141
13:32.659 --> 13:34.406
Ah!

142
13:34.863 --> 13:36.733
You struggle in vain!

143
13:52.719 --> 13:53.738
Disgusting.

144
13:53.976 --> 13:56.230
He is nothing but a sniveling coward!

145
13:57.389 --> 13:58.217
Lancer.

146
14:00.736 --> 14:01.919
Is something wrong?

147
14:06.189 --> 14:07.601
It's my master.

148
14:07.859 --> 14:09.158
He's in danger.

149
14:10.128 --> 14:14.251
It seems, he left me here and
breached the castle himself.

150
14:17.509 --> 14:20.376
I'm certain that the danger comes from my own master.

151
14:22.209 --> 14:24.260
Lancer, hurry to his side.

152
14:24.709 --> 14:26.174
Go to your master as aid.

153
14:28.709 --> 14:31.688
King of Knights, you have my thanks.

154
14:32.049 --> 14:33.219
Think nothing of it.

155
14:33.429 --> 14:36.797
You and I have sworn to settle matters
in a manner befitting two knights.

156
14:37.004 --> 14:38.808
Let us keep our pride intact.

157
14:45.928 --> 14:50.439
That must mean that all went
according to Kiritsugu's plan.

158
14:56.624 --> 14:59.872
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

159
15:00.197 --> 15:01.624
To cut and tie.

160
15:04.596 --> 15:08.186
The nuance is a little different
than destruction and regeneration.

161
15:09.186 --> 15:11.244
If you cut a thread and then retie it,

162
15:11.331 --> 15:13.571
it will always be thicker where you cut it.

163
15:13.606 --> 15:14.507
Isn't that right?

164
15:14.632 --> 15:15.688
In that sense,

165
15:15.776 --> 15:18.965
it carries a connotation of irreversible change.

166
15:23.196 --> 15:24.974
I've powdered some of your ribs,

167
15:25.085 --> 15:27.635
and also put a very special part inside of here.

168
15:28.416 --> 15:30.216
Your origin will materialize

169
15:30.376 --> 15:32.679
in anything shot by these bullets.

170
15:33.126 --> 15:35.968
It's especially powerful against mages.

171
15:36.296 --> 15:38.669
If they attempt to use any magic against it,

172
15:38.947 --> 15:44.685
your origin will interfere with and destroy their
magic circuits which will reconnect improperly.

173
15:45.074 --> 15:50.063
The more powerful the mage, the more their
magic circuits will run haywire and short out.

174
15:50.755 --> 15:53.288
Naturally, they will never be able to recover

175
15:53.526 --> 15:55.307
either as a mage or human.

176
15:56.486 --> 15:58.412
These will be your ace in the hole.

177
15:58.712 --> 16:00.129
"Origin Rounds".

178
16:00.517 --> 16:02.496
I've made 66 in total.

179
16:03.366 --> 16:04.619
Don't waste them.

180
16:51.162 --> 16:56.046
I'm sure you must know how easy it would
be for me to skewer you right now, correct?

181
16:56.823 --> 16:58.969
Master of Saber.

182
16:59.918 --> 17:01.505
So that's it, is it?

183
17:02.006 --> 17:04.204
I shall not let you kill my master,

184
17:04.588 --> 17:06.968
nor will I kill Saber's master.

185
17:07.306 --> 17:11.211
Neither of us wish for our duel to be ended that way.

186
17:11.630 --> 17:13.110
Never forget this.

187
17:13.419 --> 17:15.962
The reason you survived our encounter

188
17:16.742 --> 17:19.681
is the nobility demonstrated by the King of Knights.

189
17:30.230 --> 17:32.371
Woman, I have one question.

190
17:32.576 --> 17:36.776
It appears to me that the two
of you came here to challenge me

191
17:36.801 --> 17:40.521
with the intention of
protecting Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
17:42.386 --> 17:44.868
By whose order do you dare attack?

193
17:46.636 --> 17:48.950
You do not possess Command Seals,

194
17:49.176 --> 17:51.104
so you are not the Einzbern Master.

195
17:51.636 --> 17:56.228
Most likely, you are a homunculus
charged with protecting the Grail vessel.

196
17:56.766 --> 17:58.944
There's no way that someone like that

197
17:59.186 --> 18:03.681
would ever be stupid enough to risk
going to the front lines of the battle.

198
18:04.229 --> 18:06.024
So I ask again.

199
18:06.736 --> 18:07.851
Tell me now.

200
18:08.536 --> 18:10.576
Who ordered you to fight me?

201
18:18.831 --> 18:19.325
Hm.

202
18:21.743 --> 18:23.169
Master Kirei.

203
18:23.791 --> 18:27.204
Caster, as well as Lancer and his master,

204
18:27.676 --> 18:29.151
have left the forest.

205
18:29.814 --> 18:31.788
Saber will arrive shortly.

206
18:32.516 --> 18:35.024
My lord, it is dangerous here.

207
18:36.520 --> 18:37.121
Hm.

208
18:44.703 --> 18:45.487
Fascinating.

209
18:46.026 --> 18:47.544
So it's red after all.

210
18:59.166 --> 19:00.407
Impossible.

211
19:01.456 --> 19:06.794
Could these women have challenged me of their
own accord without being ordered to do so?

212
19:08.968 --> 19:09.672
No.

213
19:10.636 --> 19:12.755
Kiritsugu Emiya is like me.

214
19:13.346 --> 19:15.510
He is alone and empty inside,

215
19:16.121 --> 19:17.814
understood by no one.

216
19:21.284 --> 19:22.486
He must be.

217
19:25.149 --> 19:25.990
Irisviel!

218
19:27.108 --> 19:28.103
Irisviel!

219
19:28.584 --> 19:29.621
Can you hear me?

220
19:33.045 --> 19:34.696
Saber.

221
19:35.103 --> 19:36.143
Stay awake.

222
19:36.261 --> 19:37.755
You must stay awake.

223
19:38.174 --> 19:39.765
I'm going to call Kiritsugu.

224
19:40.286 --> 19:41.705
Be strong until then.

225
19:42.122 --> 19:43.824
Where is Kirei,

226
19:44.561 --> 19:47.639
the enemy who was here just a minute ago?

227
19:47.776 --> 19:49.348
He escaped.

228
19:49.822 --> 19:52.255
Had I been only a second faster,

229
19:52.516 --> 19:54.632
this would never have happened to you.

230
19:55.596 --> 19:57.841
What happened to Maiya?

231
19:58.079 --> 20:00.891
Her wounds are grave, but not life‐threatening.

232
20:01.396 --> 20:03.173
I'm more concerned about you.

233
20:03.816 --> 20:05.277
You've lost so much blood.

234
20:05.867 --> 20:06.488
Huh?

235
20:09.755 --> 20:11.069
Irisviel, how...

236
20:16.826 --> 20:18.143
How can this be?

237
20:19.496 --> 20:21.797
I want you to carry Avalon, Iri.

238
20:22.329 --> 20:23.133
What?

239
20:23.546 --> 20:27.684
But, this is a Noble Phantasm
that heals its bearer's wounds.

240
20:27.934 --> 20:29.298
I think you should keep it.

241
20:29.552 --> 20:35.375
No, Iri, unless its original owner,
Saber, is nearby to supply it with mana,

242
20:36.016 --> 20:38.020
the scabbard won't function at all.

243
20:38.686 --> 20:41.922
You will be the one who'll be
working with Saber from now on.

244
20:42.880 --> 20:44.265
So you should have it.

245
20:45.066 --> 20:48.031
Keep it within you as a conceptual weapon.

246
20:48.831 --> 20:51.375
Additionally, tell no one of this,

247
20:52.528 --> 20:54.014
not even Saber herself.

248
21:02.052 --> 21:06.129
From the moment you touched me, I felt Avalon's power.

249
21:07.336 --> 21:08.679
Thank you, Saber.

250
21:13.290 --> 21:14.812
Kirei Kotomine.

251
21:15.846 --> 21:19.176
That inquisitor is as dangerous
as I imagined he'd be.

252
21:19.913 --> 21:21.980
No, even more so.

253
21:22.646 --> 21:23.998
We were lucky today.

254
21:24.659 --> 21:27.169
But there's no telling what will happen next time.

255
21:27.734 --> 21:32.682
All I know for certain is that I can't
let him get to Kiritsugu no matter what.

256
21:34.097 --> 21:38.446
But, I'm not the only one here who is protecting him.

257
21:39.576 --> 21:42.041
Isn't that right, Maiya?

258
21:44.086 --> 21:46.808
Next time, we'll win for sure.

259
21:47.626 --> 21:50.454
We'll both protect Kiritsugu, okay?
