1
00:27.800 --> 00:29.180
Kiritsugu.

2
02:02.490 --> 02:04.257
I'm not dreaming, am I?

3
02:05.198 --> 02:06.530
You really came?

4
02:07.041 --> 02:09.774
You really came to see me again.

5
02:10.669 --> 02:12.810
Yes, that's right.

6
02:14.458 --> 02:15.592
Thank you.

7
02:20.208 --> 02:21.590
My last task

8
02:22.548 --> 02:24.434
is to return this to you.

9
02:40.728 --> 02:41.593
Take it.

10
02:42.398 --> 02:47.014
From now on, you will be the
one who will be needing Avalon.

11
02:48.237 --> 02:50.977
When you begin your final battle for the Grail,

12
02:51.304 --> 02:52.734
I'm sure it will aid you.

13
02:58.202 --> 02:59.222
You know what?

14
03:00.078 --> 03:01.496
I'm really happy.

15
03:03.386 --> 03:06.416
To love, to be loved.

16
03:07.303 --> 03:10.616
To have a husband and daughter for nine whole years.

17
03:13.048 --> 03:14.061
I'm grateful.

18
03:14.518 --> 03:16.254
You gave me everything.

19
03:18.064 --> 03:21.104
You gave me all the happiness in the world.

20
03:21.766 --> 03:24.114
Something that was never meant for me.

21
03:25.349 --> 03:30.306
I'm sorry, I wanted to show
you much more of this world.

22
03:31.267 --> 03:33.342
No, it was enough.

23
03:34.844 --> 03:38.188
If there's still any happiness left to experience,

24
03:38.648 --> 03:41.705
I want you to give it all to our sweet Ilya,

25
03:42.620 --> 03:43.960
to your daughter.

26
03:45.143 --> 03:48.271
Our angel, our beloved Ilya.

27
03:51.943 --> 03:53.474
I want you to promise

28
03:53.678 --> 03:56.115
to bring Ilya to this country someday.

29
03:56.649 --> 04:02.650
Promise me that you'll show her everything
that I didn't get to see, amazing things.

30
04:03.698 --> 04:05.559
Blossoming cherry trees,

31
04:06.781 --> 04:08.241
and the summer clouds.

32
04:09.911 --> 04:10.965
I will.

33
04:13.040 --> 04:14.955
Okay, I have to go.

34
04:16.661 --> 04:19.094
Yes, you be careful.

35
04:20.702 --> 04:21.669
I love you.

36
04:31.135 --> 04:33.588
Saber is heading to Rider's hideout right now.

37
04:34.095 --> 04:35.010
Is that correct?

38
04:35.765 --> 04:37.447
Yes, she's on her way.

39
04:38.190 --> 04:40.470
I'm going to kill Tokiomi Tohsaka.

40
04:40.950 --> 04:42.998
If Rider and Saber engage in battle

41
04:43.692 --> 04:46.135
there's a good chance Archer will also appear.

42
04:46.615 --> 04:47.637
I'll hit him there.

43
04:48.575 --> 04:51.607
I want you to stay here and watch over Iri.

44
04:51.955 --> 04:52.949
I understand.

45
04:54.285 --> 04:55.910
Um, Kiritsugu.

46
04:59.455 --> 05:00.257
Finally.

47
05:01.545 --> 05:02.755
You look focused.

48
05:03.755 --> 05:05.016
Just like you used to.

49
05:15.555 --> 05:17.985
I don't feel a servant's presence.

50
05:48.905 --> 05:50.136
There's no barrier?

51
05:51.425 --> 05:52.573
What's going on?

52
05:58.225 --> 06:00.195
So, is that good?

53
06:00.435 --> 06:01.646
Nope, it's awful.

54
06:02.155 --> 06:04.852
Guess Japanese cuisine isn't that good after all.

55
06:05.192 --> 06:11.181
Boy, you walked right by Okonomiyaki Shoki
in Newtown without even stopping to look.

56
06:11.478 --> 06:14.360
Their modanyaki was a thing of beauty.

57
06:14.520 --> 06:16.535
Too bad you didn't pick up any of that.

58
06:16.855 --> 06:21.571
If you wanna eat there again, you're gonna have
to recover enough so that you can materialize.

59
06:23.295 --> 06:24.822
Do you recognize this spot?

60
06:25.715 --> 06:27.515
This is the place where I summoned you.

61
06:28.237 --> 06:32.250
It's the Fuyuki location with the
leylines that suit you best, remember?

62
06:32.703 --> 06:35.540
You should be able to recover much more quickly here.

63
06:37.155 --> 06:39.557
I've decided that I'm staying here all day.

64
06:40.555 --> 06:42.154
Just sleeping, that's all.

65
06:42.435 --> 06:44.815
So take my mana, as much as you want.

66
06:44.876 --> 06:45.906
Just don't kill me.

67
06:46.786 --> 06:49.537
Maybe it'll help you feel a little bit better.

68
06:52.365 --> 06:54.210
If you had already figured it out

69
06:54.271 --> 06:56.405
you should've said something earlier.

70
06:56.566 --> 07:02.766
Finding out afterwards that someone's been onto you
the whole time is... well, well, it's a bit embarrassing.

71
07:03.046 --> 07:05.714
You idiot, you should've just told me about it!

72
07:06.295 --> 07:09.585
If you aren't at full strength
at the exact moment I need you

73
07:09.742 --> 07:11.827
I'll be the one who ends up in danger.

74
07:16.385 --> 07:18.859
Why didn't you say anything, Rider?

75
07:19.555 --> 07:23.089
I thought that maybe I could tough
it out a little while longer,

76
07:23.239 --> 07:27.094
but the fatigue from the river battle
has hit me harder than I expected.

77
07:27.800 --> 07:30.415
Yeah, well, when it's all said and done,

78
07:30.529 --> 07:33.492
your Noble Phantasm consumes a ton of power.

79
07:33.825 --> 07:35.830
At first, I didn't really notice.

80
07:36.655 --> 07:41.592
Because it wasn't affecting me I thought it
was all incredibly efficient or something.

81
07:44.705 --> 07:49.845
Rider, honestly, instead of using mana
that was supposed to come from me ,

82
07:50.076 --> 07:53.002
you managed to use your own stored power, didn't you?

83
07:54.234 --> 07:56.578
And not only that, you did it twice.

84
07:57.762 --> 07:59.629
What's the big idea doing that?

85
08:00.277 --> 08:02.690
Well, you know,

86
08:03.607 --> 08:06.425
I mean, when you get right down to it, as a servant,

87
08:06.818 --> 08:09.377
I'm a natural soul eater of sorts.

88
08:09.644 --> 08:12.983
If I involve you when I expend mana at my maximum rate

89
08:13.403 --> 08:15.982
it could put your life at serious risk.

90
08:16.575 --> 08:18.803
Yeah, but I'm fine with that.

91
08:19.615 --> 08:21.856
This is a battle that I got us into.

92
08:22.348 --> 08:25.108
Unless I bleed or make sacrifices,

93
08:25.819 --> 08:28.276
there's no point at all of winning this war.

94
08:29.375 --> 08:30.360
Hmmm.

95
08:31.701 --> 08:34.847
All I wanted was to prove myself,

96
08:35.251 --> 08:38.448
that I could... that someone just like me

97
08:38.715 --> 08:41.499
can take whatever it is he wants with his own two hands.

98
08:41.719 --> 08:48.272
But boy, I hope you realize that all of
that only applies if the Grail truly exists.

99
08:48.725 --> 08:51.565
You know, I once did something similar.

100
08:51.825 --> 08:55.737
Fought ferociously for something
that might not have even existed.

101
08:56.445 --> 08:57.497
Oceanus.

102
08:57.890 --> 08:59.054
That's right.

103
08:59.367 --> 09:01.688
I said I'd show them Oceanus,

104
09:01.713 --> 09:08.319
and they were so swept up by my story that they
all followed me on my quest without a single doubt.

105
09:08.899 --> 09:11.314
Many died along the way,

106
09:11.400 --> 09:15.245
all dreaming of Oceanus until the very end.

107
09:15.702 --> 09:19.027
When I gained this era's
knowledge, it hit my really hard.

108
09:19.215 --> 09:22.680
I'd had no idea the world was an enclosed sphere.

109
09:23.345 --> 09:24.723
What a bad joke.

110
09:26.305 --> 09:28.635
But even so, when I saw the map,

111
09:28.815 --> 09:31.192
I had no choice but to accept it.

112
09:33.505 --> 09:38.752
It seems I've had my fill of
letting people die for fairytales.

113
09:39.227 --> 09:41.491
If the Grail's existence was
certain,

114
09:41.890 --> 09:46.271
I'd have no objection to you risking
your life in an effort to possess it.

115
09:46.915 --> 09:50.385
But unfortunately, that is not the case.

116
09:50.745 --> 09:51.666
Even so...

117
09:53.538 --> 09:56.867
don't you forget, I am still your master.

118
10:01.885 --> 10:05.843
Boy, learned to talk back now, have you?

119
10:05.975 --> 10:06.885
Excellent.

120
10:08.435 --> 10:12.554
It's true, your magic circuits
are more powerful than usual.

121
10:13.396 --> 10:18.321
If I rest all day I should be ready
to go another round come nightfall.

122
10:19.108 --> 10:21.489
Oh yeah, another round?

123
10:21.695 --> 10:24.162
What exactly are you planning to do next?

124
10:24.995 --> 10:26.748
Hm, good question.

125
10:27.455 --> 10:30.784
I'm thinking that we should begin with Saber.

126
10:32.165 --> 10:33.846
At the rate you're regenerating,

127
10:33.915 --> 10:36.503
how much will you be able to recover by tonight?

128
10:37.465 --> 10:40.170
If I only use the Gordius Wheel for flight,

129
10:40.437 --> 10:42.372
there really shouldn't be a problem.

130
10:43.095 --> 10:49.530
However, I'm afraid I'll only be able to
employ my Ionioi Hetairoi one more time.

131
10:49.685 --> 10:50.590
I see.

132
10:50.803 --> 10:54.268
We should probably save it for
the later fight with Archer.

133
10:54.498 --> 10:56.652
Then Rider, I don't get it.

134
10:57.195 --> 10:59.746
Why is it you wanna fight Saber first?

135
11:00.485 --> 11:04.245
I must defeat her, and no one else.

136
11:04.575 --> 11:07.813
As a heroic spirit, it is my responsibility.

137
11:08.001 --> 11:09.126
What's that mean?

138
11:10.165 --> 11:13.107
If I don't show that silly girl the right path,

139
11:13.260 --> 11:15.240
the path to true kingship,

140
11:15.602 --> 11:17.488
I fear she'll never learn.

141
11:18.005 --> 11:20.836
That would be too sad to bear thinking about.

142
11:20.949 --> 11:24.057
Whatever, have it however you want.

143
11:24.837 --> 11:28.320
Boy, quit keeping yourself awake and just go to sleep.

144
11:28.815 --> 11:31.792
Rest is the battle that you face right now.

145
11:31.941 --> 11:32.585
Mmm.

146
11:36.706 --> 11:40.503
I am the shunned, the scorned,

147
11:40.856 --> 11:43.613
the despised.

148
11:44.313 --> 11:46.007
Who the hell are you?

149
11:46.466 --> 11:49.622
My name is unworthy of praise.

150
11:49.936 --> 11:52.124
My body unworthy of envy.

151
11:52.330 --> 11:56.085
I am the shadow cast by the heroic spirits' light,

152
11:56.178 --> 11:59.613
the darkness born in the shadow of shining legend.

153
12:05.566 --> 12:07.508
Thus do I hate,

154
12:07.986 --> 12:10.183
thus do I resent.

155
12:10.845 --> 12:17.059
I feed on the lamentation of those who sink into
darkness, and curse those who shine so brightly.

156
12:18.763 --> 12:21.207
Her shadow is my shame.

157
12:21.640 --> 12:24.170
Her honor remains forever unsullied.

158
12:24.590 --> 12:27.416
Thus am I forever looked down upon.

159
12:30.279 --> 12:33.696
You are the sacrifice.

160
12:43.706 --> 12:45.291
Healing won't help me.

161
12:45.612 --> 12:47.459
I'm going to die soon.

162
12:53.188 --> 12:54.279
Damn it.

163
12:59.995 --> 13:04.828
Really, what a sorry sight you are.
You look absolutely terrible.

164
13:07.984 --> 13:10.623
Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

165
13:10.697 --> 13:13.132
I'm not blaming you for your current condition.

166
13:13.931 --> 13:18.136
To be perfectly honest, I never would've
imagined that you'd hold out for this long.

167
13:18.336 --> 13:21.405
You've really surprised me, and so,

168
13:21.511 --> 13:24.363
I shall give you the ace I've
kept hidden up my sleeve,

169
13:24.388 --> 13:28.239
secreted away for use at
precisely this stage of the game.

170
13:28.787 --> 13:29.407
Take it.

171
13:43.099 --> 13:44.818
It works quickly, doesn't it?

172
13:45.059 --> 13:47.755
The worm I just gave you is very special.

173
13:48.028 --> 13:51.776
It was the first to feed on
Sakura's innocent purity.

174
13:53.086 --> 13:55.020
How does it feel, Kariya?

175
13:55.300 --> 13:58.996
For an entire year it has been
devouring the girl's life energy.

176
13:59.316 --> 14:01.365
It's a magnificent mana source.

177
14:02.460 --> 14:04.715
Now, go back and fight, Kariya,

178
14:04.961 --> 14:09.278
and make good use of the precious life
force you've stolen from young Sakura.

179
14:09.900 --> 14:14.374
Go and use every ounce of your flesh
and bone to acquire the Holy Grail,

180
14:14.560 --> 14:18.566
if someone such as you is even capable of it, that is.

181
14:22.613 --> 14:23.733
Hey, Maiya.

182
14:25.437 --> 14:28.459
I'm curious as to why you fight for Kiritsugu.

183
14:30.209 --> 14:32.666
Because I have nothing else in life.

184
14:33.000 --> 14:36.556
I can't remember my family or
my own name for that matter.

185
14:37.209 --> 14:41.508
Maiya Hisau was the name on the very first fake passport

186
14:41.770 --> 14:43.416
that Kiritsugu made for me.

187
14:55.809 --> 15:01.233
All I remember is that the place where
I came from was a terribly poor country.

188
15:01.826 --> 15:03.401
The wars never ended,

189
15:03.788 --> 15:06.406
even though there was no money to maintain the armies.

190
15:06.598 --> 15:09.537
But day after day, they continued to kill one another.

191
15:10.126 --> 15:12.747
Then one day, someone had an idea.

192
15:12.967 --> 15:15.211
Rather than conscript and train soldiers,

193
15:15.425 --> 15:17.853
it was cheaper and faster to abduct children

194
15:18.153 --> 15:20.136
and send them out to fight the battles.

195
15:20.136 --> 15:22.165
You mean, you were one of them?

196
15:24.735 --> 15:26.881
Aim at the enemy and pull the trigger.

197
15:27.714 --> 15:29.634
That was my sole function in life.

198
15:30.281 --> 15:31.975
I threw everything else away.

199
15:33.079 --> 15:35.279
As a human being, I'm dead inside,

200
15:35.896 --> 15:38.509
but the outer shell continues to function.

201
15:39.131 --> 15:41.435
Still working just like it did before.

202
15:41.995 --> 15:46.244
That's always been my life,
but regardless, Kiritsugu took me in,

203
15:46.584 --> 15:52.020
so however he wants to use me is fine by
me, and that's the reason I'm here.

204
15:54.166 --> 15:59.609
To tell you the truth, madam,
it was your passion for all this that surprised me.

205
16:00.476 --> 16:03.252
You've been secluded in the castle where you were born,

206
16:03.472 --> 16:05.939
knowing so little of the outside world.

207
16:06.465 --> 16:10.620
So I simply can't imagine why you would
fight this hard for Kiritsugu's dream.

208
16:10.973 --> 16:13.223
To change a world you've never really seen.

209
16:14.636 --> 16:18.080
Well, I... you're right.

210
16:18.526 --> 16:21.668
I cannot truly understand Kiritsugu's ideals,

211
16:22.066 --> 16:24.642
or why he holds them close to his heart.

212
16:26.826 --> 16:30.272
It's as you say, I've been sheltered,

213
16:30.704 --> 16:35.037
and I know practically nothing of the
world that Kiritsugu longs to change.

214
16:35.471 --> 16:39.806
All the ideals I speak of are merely
words that I learned from him.

215
16:42.426 --> 16:44.148
But please don't let him know that.

216
16:45.041 --> 16:48.998
I've always told him that I thought
he was doing the right thing,

217
16:49.345 --> 16:53.886
and also that those same ideals
were worth giving up my life for.

218
16:54.956 --> 16:57.317
And I pretended that I understood him.

219
16:58.119 --> 17:00.233
Then, madam, in that case,

220
17:00.668 --> 17:02.841
have you no wish or longing of your own?

221
17:03.276 --> 17:04.231
My wish?

222
17:04.799 --> 17:06.953
Oh yes, I have one.

223
17:08.497 --> 17:11.256
I wish for Kiritsugu and Saber

224
17:11.549 --> 17:14.322
to prevail and win possession of the Holy Grail.

225
17:14.508 --> 17:17.699
You mean, you support the Einzbern's desire

226
17:17.892 --> 17:19.376
to attain the Third Magic?

227
17:19.949 --> 17:24.150
No, what I desire is an end to conflict in the world.

228
17:24.606 --> 17:28.860
If Kiritsugu's wish comes true and fighting everywhere
comes to an end,

229
17:29.229 --> 17:32.624
the battles for possession of
the Holy Grail here in Fuyuki

230
17:33.016 --> 17:34.510
will be no exception.

231
17:35.289 --> 17:39.650
I want this fourth battle to be
the last of the Holy Grail Wars.

232
17:41.146 --> 17:42.685
You mean, for your daughter?

233
17:44.151 --> 17:46.726
If Kiritsugu and I fail to get the Grail,

234
17:47.350 --> 17:48.776
then Ilya's next.

235
17:50.536 --> 17:55.859
It's unfortunate, but that is the destiny
that an Einzbern homunculus must bear.

236
17:56.206 --> 17:59.165
So my wish is to be the last one.

237
17:59.711 --> 18:04.783
If that comes true she'll be able to live
out her life as a normal human being.

238
18:06.345 --> 18:11.859
Maiya, what will you do after Kiritsugu
reaches his goal and saves the world?

239
18:12.602 --> 18:14.502
I don't expect to survive that long.

240
18:15.226 --> 18:16.566
And even if I do,

241
18:17.548 --> 18:19.945
there'll be no reason for me to exist anymore.

242
18:21.132 --> 18:23.155
I'm sure it will be that kind of world

243
18:24.115 --> 18:25.921
once Kiritsugu changes it.

244
18:26.308 --> 18:29.060
But you do have a reason to exist.

245
18:29.387 --> 18:30.364
You think so?

246
18:31.097 --> 18:35.138
You must look for your real name,
and then go out and find your family.

247
18:36.078 --> 18:38.375
Those aren't things anyone should forget.

248
18:38.802 --> 18:43.240
You must learn who you are and etch
yourself into the memories of others.

249
18:45.376 --> 18:46.617
So live, Maiya,

250
18:47.046 --> 18:49.385
for yourself and for me too.

251
18:50.676 --> 18:55.657
I'll do my best, but all that has
to wait until after the battle ends.

252
18:56.205 --> 18:59.904
Right now we must be cautious.
Both he and I

253
19:00.391 --> 19:02.455
must stay on constant guard.

254
19:04.178 --> 19:07.369
The one who died was Tokiomi Tohsaka.

255
19:11.045 --> 19:13.671
Oh, Maiya, you really are stubborn.

256
19:32.316 --> 19:33.023
Maiya!

257
19:33.676 --> 19:34.376
Iri!

258
19:36.275 --> 19:38.359
By my command seal, I order you!

259
19:39.634 --> 19:42.691
Saber, go to the storehouse immediately!

260
19:42.936 --> 19:43.945
Kiritsugu.

261
19:48.356 --> 19:49.060
What happened?

262
19:51.616 --> 19:52.311
Maiya!

263
19:57.469 --> 19:59.129
Saber.

264
19:59.706 --> 20:01.320
Don't try to speak.

265
20:03.442 --> 20:05.772
Hurry, follow him.

266
20:06.067 --> 20:08.188
Don't let him escape with her.

267
20:08.555 --> 20:10.992
Rider took madam with him.

268
20:11.139 --> 20:12.676
But if I leave... 

269
20:12.936 --> 20:14.131
 Don't worry.

270
20:14.364 --> 20:16.357
I'll be just fine.

271
20:16.886 --> 20:19.363
And Kiritsugu will come soon.

272
20:19.766 --> 20:21.738
So, hurry.

273
20:27.838 --> 20:32.148
Maiya, you have to try and hold on until Kiritsugu returns.

274
20:32.406 --> 20:35.090
I shall bring Irisviel back safe.

275
20:50.431 --> 20:52.677
Rider, I can't believe it.

276
21:19.580 --> 21:21.244
It was Rider.

277
21:23.916 --> 21:26.214
Yes, I understand.

278
21:29.277 --> 21:32.097
You mustn't cry, not over me.

279
21:34.716 --> 21:39.117
You need to save those tears for your wife.

280
21:39.699 --> 21:41.349
You can't cry here.

281
21:43.322 --> 21:45.646
Be strong, you have to finish.

282
21:46.016 --> 21:47.132
So don't cry yet.

283
21:47.896 --> 21:49.121
You can't break.

284
21:50.146 --> 21:51.182
You can't.

285
21:51.762 --> 21:52.655
Maiya.

286
21:53.752 --> 21:59.447
You know, this morning, you finally
looked like Kiritsugu, like your old self.

287
21:59.833 --> 22:02.314
Don't lose your resolve over this.

288
22:02.616 --> 22:03.381
Promise.

289
22:08.395 --> 22:09.617
Don't worry, Maiya.

290
22:10.929 --> 22:12.400
Leave the rest to Saber.

291
22:13.376 --> 22:16.206
Maiya, your task here

292
22:17.352 --> 22:18.367
is finished.

293
22:29.416 --> 22:30.293
Maiya.

294
22:37.188 --> 22:38.277
Maiya?
