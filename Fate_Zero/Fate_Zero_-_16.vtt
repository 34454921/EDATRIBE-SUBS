1
00:02.306 --> 00:04.500
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

2
00:04.933 --> 00:08.199
As you can imagine,
things have been rather hectic this evening.

3
00:10.540 --> 00:13.944
I'm sure it couldn't be helped
given the extraordinary situation.

4
00:14.557 --> 00:17.558
It's going to be rather difficult to cover all that up.

5
00:17.818 --> 00:19.191
Well, perhaps.

6
00:19.800 --> 00:23.828
What has happened is far too much for
the holy church to handle by herself,

7
00:24.361 --> 00:28.502
and so we are accepting any and all aid
proffered for assistance in this effort.

8
00:29.260 --> 00:31.763
Now the, down to business.

9
00:32.930 --> 00:38.202
Regarding my request, I'm curious
as to what your decision is, Father.

10
00:38.650 --> 00:42.472
I speak, of course,
of the reward offered for Caster's defeat.

11
02:15.948 --> 02:17.298
This is wonderful.

12
02:17.847 --> 02:25.339
Once I receive the command seal for killing Caster,
Diarmuid and I will finally be truly connected forever.

13
02:35.928 --> 02:36.786
My right hand!

14
02:37.119 --> 02:38.719
It's gone, it's gone!

15
02:39.258 --> 02:40.049
My right hand!

16
02:40.256 --> 02:41.423
My right hand!

17
02:41.928 --> 02:45.319
I need it or I...
I cannot call Diarmuid,

18
02:45.558 --> 02:48.001
I won't be able to make him care for me.

19
02:48.688 --> 02:49.462
My right hand.

20
02:49.659 --> 02:51.123
My right hand, my right hand,

21
02:51.299 --> 02:52.737
my right hand, my right hand!

22
02:54.318 --> 02:54.707
Hand...

23
02:55.698 --> 02:56.520
my right hand.

24
03:02.491 --> 03:03.383
Success.

25
03:03.618 --> 03:05.891
I have secured Sola‐Ui over in New Town.

26
03:06.903 --> 03:09.523
I removed the command seals in her right arm.

27
03:10.068 --> 03:10.637
Fine.

28
03:11.628 --> 03:12.994
Get out of there immediately.

29
03:13.717 --> 03:15.932
Lancer should be returning any time now.

30
03:16.468 --> 03:17.086
Roger.

31
03:29.898 --> 03:31.868
I saved Kariya Matou.

32
03:32.478 --> 03:35.016
Without doubt, he could threaten my master.

33
03:35.568 --> 03:36.895
There is no excuse.

34
03:37.029 --> 03:38.617
This is an act of rebellion.

35
03:39.408 --> 03:43.136
But what is this I'm feeling?

36
03:43.908 --> 03:46.118
It is not regret.

37
03:47.498 --> 03:48.507
Could it be...

38
03:48.838 --> 03:50.800
that I'm excited about this?

39
03:51.877 --> 03:55.507
Of course, it's true that in the defeat
of the Servant Caster and his master,

40
03:55.718 --> 03:59.642
the Servant Lancer played an important
part in the overall conduct of the battle.

41
04:00.073 --> 04:04.010
A fact varified by a number of
reports from various observers.

42
04:04.471 --> 04:05.303
Then it's clear.

43
04:05.678 --> 04:09.310
As master of Lancer, I have the right
to receive one of the command seals.

44
04:10.018 --> 04:11.478
It's not that simple.

45
04:12.688 --> 04:14.502
Lord Kayneth Archibald...

46
04:15.488 --> 04:20.402
I am unsure whether it is at all inappropriate
to consider you a master at this point.

47
04:20.782 --> 04:23.139
Father, my pact with Lancer

48
04:23.288 --> 04:27.765
was from the outset executed jointly
by myself and my fiancee, Sola‐Ui.

49
04:28.158 --> 04:32.217
And is Sola‐Ui not the one currently
supplying mana to the servant?

50
04:32.532 --> 04:36.311
And is she not also acting as defacto
caretaker for the command seals?

51
04:36.508 --> 04:37.613
Yes, that's true.

52
04:37.668 --> 04:40.654
I've temporarily given her
custody of the command seals.

53
04:40.882 --> 04:45.348
However, the rights accorded by the
pact still legally reside with me.

54
04:46.022 --> 04:50.587
After all, Father, the petition I submitted
to the church to be considered a master

55
04:50.660 --> 04:53.759
was filed in my name and did not include Sola‐Ui.

56
04:56.074 --> 04:57.774
Very well, I agree.

57
04:58.068 --> 05:00.612
Your rights as a master shall remain intact.

58
05:01.119 --> 05:05.270
Now, Lord Archibald, extend your hand, please.

59
05:07.748 --> 05:09.618
Take this and drink from it.

60
05:09.734 --> 05:15.659
This is my blood, the blood of the everlasting covenant
which will be poured out for you and for all mankind.

61
05:15.838 --> 05:17.901
Do this in my memory.

62
05:27.562 --> 05:32.305
I hope you will continue to fight a noble
battle for the Grail as a worthy master.

63
05:32.545 --> 05:34.398
Yes, of course, Father.

64
05:48.238 --> 05:50.735
I'm down to a single command seal.

65
05:50.868 --> 05:52.675
My situation remains dire.

66
05:52.861 --> 05:57.272
I cannot allow the other masters an
opportunity to acquire an additional seal,

67
05:57.567 --> 06:00.229
not if I intend to possess the Holy Grail.

68
06:04.171 --> 06:05.145
Mistress Sola‐Ui.

69
06:06.513 --> 06:08.590
You complete incompetent!

70
06:08.763 --> 06:10.612
You useless bumbling fool!

71
06:10.892 --> 06:14.151
You couldn't even protect a
single woman from being attacked?!

72
06:14.733 --> 06:15.211
Huh.

73
06:15.893 --> 06:18.359
I'm sick of all your talk of chivalry.

74
06:18.903 --> 06:20.733
I am grievously sorry, Master.

75
06:21.942 --> 06:23.961
She may have been a mere substitute,

76
06:24.241 --> 06:27.662
but you even failed to protect your
own master from nearly being killed!

77
06:28.073 --> 06:30.633
What good are you as a servant, I ask you?

78
06:30.926 --> 06:34.014
I'm amazed you had the unmitigated
nerve to return here alone.

79
06:34.543 --> 06:36.646
Please understand, my master.

80
06:37.333 --> 06:39.448
Mistress Sola‐Ui and I never entered

81
06:39.950 --> 06:41.314
into a proper pact,

82
06:42.113 --> 06:44.746
and as such we could not sense each other's presence.

83
06:44.923 --> 06:46.148
That's no excuse.

84
06:46.264 --> 06:49.098
You should've taken special
care to ensure her safety.

85
06:49.433 --> 06:51.600
My master, fret not.

86
06:52.103 --> 06:53.648
Mistress Sola‐Ui yet lives.

87
06:54.433 --> 06:56.816
She continues to supply me with mana.

88
06:56.893 --> 06:58.258
That's irrelevant!

89
06:58.353 --> 06:59.744
You are not her servant.

90
06:59.903 --> 07:02.161
And therefore you can not discern her location.

91
07:02.273 --> 07:05.402
So it doesn't matter in the least
whether or not you know if she's alive.

92
07:05.613 --> 07:10.059
Oh, Sola‐Ui, I should've never
given you those command seals.

93
07:11.373 --> 07:13.060
I could not dissuade her, Master.

94
07:13.590 --> 07:15.510
I share in the responsibility.

95
07:17.663 --> 07:20.733
I really can't believe you
had the nerve to say that.

96
07:20.937 --> 07:22.786
Don't try fooling me, Lancer.

97
07:22.963 --> 07:26.673
It was you who encouraged
Sola‐Ui to become ambitious.

98
07:27.673 --> 07:29.502
I would never do that, Master.

99
07:30.183 --> 07:32.327
It's just as it was in the legend.

100
07:32.541 --> 07:37.371
Are you truly incapable of seeing your Lord's
fiancee without attempting to seduce her?

101
07:39.147 --> 07:40.345
My master...

102
07:40.643 --> 07:43.578
please retract those words right now.

103
07:44.531 --> 07:46.619
Have I struck a nerve, Lancer?

104
07:46.837 --> 07:51.275
You're nothing but a beast who swore an
oath of eternal loyalty to his master.

105
07:51.723 --> 07:55.043
And then gave into prurient
lust when the moment suited him.

106
07:55.300 --> 07:56.385
My master.

107
07:57.089 --> 07:58.069
My lord.

108
07:58.333 --> 08:00.737
Why will you not understand?

109
08:01.123 --> 08:04.612
Master, I wished only to defend my honor,

110
08:05.423 --> 08:09.013
to fight well in noble battle,
and achieve victory on your behalf.

111
08:09.145 --> 08:12.549
Don't you ever speak to me in that manner, Servant!

112
08:13.013 --> 08:14.773
Understand your place.

113
08:15.103 --> 08:19.023
You're nothing but a spectral ghost,
granted form and substance by magic.

114
08:19.313 --> 08:21.871
You dare to sit there and lecture your master!

115
08:21.983 --> 08:24.074
It is absurd and unacceptable!

116
08:25.640 --> 08:27.369
If you are so dissatisfied,

117
08:27.523 --> 08:29.571
I believe you have but one option available.

118
08:29.733 --> 08:32.808
Use your precious pride to resist my command seal.

119
08:33.993 --> 08:35.198
You'll never win.

120
08:35.468 --> 08:39.183
You servants are mere puppets,
and this seal the string that controls you.

121
08:40.313 --> 08:41.554
Lord Kayneth.

122
08:44.659 --> 08:45.333
Master.

123
08:45.413 --> 08:46.361
What now?

124
08:46.523 --> 08:49.547
Don't tell me,
you still have something to say to me?

125
08:50.053 --> 08:50.667
No.

126
08:51.213 --> 08:52.070
That isn't it.

127
08:53.383 --> 08:55.430
Something's approaching this building.

128
08:59.812 --> 09:02.577
Look, Saber, it's just as Kiritsugu said.

129
09:03.472 --> 09:05.431
There are traces of a magical barrier,

130
09:05.897 --> 09:07.324
but it's very strange.

131
09:07.710 --> 09:09.497
It hasn't been properly maintained.

132
09:10.003 --> 09:13.418
It's already starting to... fall apart.

133
09:15.459 --> 09:18.916
I did not expect to see you here, Saber.

134
09:19.749 --> 09:21.137
Well, my...

135
09:22.460 --> 09:24.639
allies found this place and informed me.

136
09:25.146 --> 09:26.936
They said that this was your location.

137
09:27.770 --> 09:32.477
You would not happen to know where my
master's betrothed is, would you, Saber?

138
09:32.985 --> 09:34.865
My master has not heard from her.

139
09:37.872 --> 09:39.232
No, I do not.

140
09:39.779 --> 09:40.933
What of it, Lancer?

141
09:41.256 --> 09:42.993
Never mind, forget it.

142
09:43.653 --> 09:46.150
Anyway, are you sure about this?

143
09:46.644 --> 09:49.840
I am certain you did not come
to engage in idle chit‐chat?

144
09:50.267 --> 09:55.763
After all, you must be completely exhausted
after employing that technique against Caster.

145
09:56.443 --> 09:58.591
No more so than all the other servants.

146
09:59.191 --> 10:00.071
I'm certain.

147
10:00.257 --> 10:02.453
None of them will be fighting further tonight.

148
10:02.826 --> 10:04.443
They will focus on defense.

149
10:05.076 --> 10:08.726
That is why we needn't worry about being interrupted.

150
10:13.604 --> 10:15.484
Dawn is nearly upon us.

151
10:15.979 --> 10:17.883
But this may be the best night

152
10:18.662 --> 10:21.129
for us to finally finish our battle.

153
10:21.662 --> 10:22.997
What say you, Lancer?

154
10:23.304 --> 10:23.928
Hm.

155
10:24.821 --> 10:26.103
Brave Saber.

156
10:26.478 --> 10:29.785
The only thing in this world
that still grants my heart peace

157
10:30.397 --> 10:33.878
is your honor and the purity
of your fighting spirit.

158
11:02.980 --> 11:04.602
Her attacks are too weak.

159
11:09.223 --> 11:10.940
Saber, why?

160
11:11.709 --> 11:13.289
You will not use your left hand?

161
11:14.912 --> 11:17.301
Don't get the wrong idea, Lancer.

162
11:17.907 --> 11:19.598
If I use my left hand here,

163
11:20.171 --> 11:22.482
the shame is certain to dull my blade

164
11:23.442 --> 11:25.312
against your powerful spear.

165
11:25.885 --> 11:27.969
A dulling such as that would be fatal.

166
11:28.582 --> 11:29.609
Saber.

167
11:30.382 --> 11:31.704
Therefore, Diarmuid...

168
11:34.973 --> 11:36.993
...this is my best strategy,

169
11:37.764 --> 11:40.843
the path that will allow me to defeat you.

170
11:44.497 --> 11:46.599
Pride is in the blade of chivalry.

171
11:47.454 --> 11:48.361
Saber...

172
11:49.556 --> 11:51.764
I am glad I was able to meet you.

173
11:56.467 --> 11:58.193
I am first Bure of Fianna,

174
11:58.640 --> 11:59.937
Diarmuid O'Dyna.

175
12:00.177 --> 12:01.350
I come for you.

176
12:01.890 --> 12:02.430
Splendid.

177
12:02.917 --> 12:06.187
For this night,
Artoria Pendragon accepts your challenge.

178
12:08.203 --> 12:09.395
Come then.

179
12:10.707 --> 12:13.032
Why does he not win?

180
12:13.172 --> 12:18.406
If he has no certain path to victory, should he not
escape with his master instead of risking defeat?

181
12:18.885 --> 12:22.866
Right now our highest priority should
be to locate and rescue Sola‐Ui.

182
12:23.126 --> 12:27.720
Why can't he not understand even that 
simple concept?! He's a useless servant!

183
12:45.450 --> 12:46.356
Why him?

184
12:46.785 --> 12:47.845
Of all people?

185
12:59.512 --> 13:00.458
This is...

186
13:01.385 --> 13:03.165
a Self‐Geis Scroll.

187
13:04.428 --> 13:06.048
A powerful magical item

188
13:06.073 --> 13:10.313
that has been used throughout the ages
to forge an absolutely unbreakable pact

189
13:10.440 --> 13:12.271
between one mage and another.

190
13:12.772 --> 13:14.021
"Binding spell.

191
13:14.201 --> 13:16.967
Affected party, Kiritsugu Emiya.

192
13:17.691 --> 13:19.499
The crest of the Emiya family

193
13:19.746 --> 13:21.552
orders the following actions:

194
13:21.906 --> 13:27.046
the pledge is to be obeyed by the affected party
upon fulfillment of the terms described herein.

195
13:27.506 --> 13:33.542
Pledge that Kiritsugu, son of Norikata,
fifth heir to the house of Emiya

196
13:33.681 --> 13:37.156
will be forever forbidden from
harming Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald

197
13:37.637 --> 13:39.672
and Sola‐Ui Nuada‐Re Sophia‐Ri,

198
13:39.900 --> 13:45.790
or from intending to, by his hand, harm or injure
them or cause them pain in any way whatsoever.

199
13:46.256 --> 13:47.063
Terms.

200
13:49.044 --> 13:54.563
In principle, the curse of the Geis cannot be
removed by any means known to the mage world.

201
13:54.903 --> 13:59.176
Even if you forfeit your life,
as long as the magic crest exists,

202
13:59.441 --> 14:01.136
it will bind your soul

203
14:01.547 --> 14:02.727
even in death.

204
14:03.574 --> 14:07.871
It's true that if I do what's written
on this scroll, he cannot kill me?

205
14:08.672 --> 14:16.286
But under these terms, my fight, the fight for
which I prepared my entire life... will end here.

206
14:17.856 --> 14:18.856
The Grail.

207
14:20.462 --> 14:22.396
And the Archibald family pride.

208
14:24.083 --> 14:26.497
He asks me to throw it all away?

209
14:47.392 --> 14:48.313
Sola‐Ui.

210
15:07.570 --> 15:12.183
Use your remaining command seals to
compel your servant to commit suicide.

211
15:15.284 --> 15:17.310
The terms of the agreement have been met.

212
15:24.930 --> 15:25.930
You wanna win!

213
15:26.543 --> 15:28.554
You wanna win so desperately.

214
15:29.054 --> 15:31.611
You desire the Grail so desperately,

215
15:32.131 --> 15:36.776
you have crushed...  you have
crushed my sole remaining wish.

216
15:37.049 --> 15:38.506
And you just stand there!

217
15:38.879 --> 15:40.881
Do you not feel any shame at all?!

218
15:41.468 --> 15:43.218
I will never forgive you.

219
15:43.425 --> 15:45.462
I will never forgive any of you!

220
15:45.870 --> 15:50.376
You inhuman monsters who have
ruined the honor of a knight.

221
15:50.956 --> 15:53.555
Let my blood taint your dreams forever!

222
15:53.902 --> 15:55.706
May the Grail be cursed!

223
15:55.981 --> 15:58.456
May the wish it grants bring disaster!

224
15:58.976 --> 16:01.830
And when you fall into the searing pits of hell,

225
16:02.270 --> 16:05.838
you'll remember the hateful rate of Diarmuid!

226
16:12.529 --> 16:14.349
So now the Geis binds you?

227
16:15.051 --> 16:16.946
Yes, it is sealed.

228
16:17.686 --> 16:19.919
I can longer kill you or Sola‐Ui.

229
16:40.982 --> 16:42.449
I can't, but...

230
16:51.346 --> 16:52.926
Kill me.

231
16:53.313 --> 16:54.788
Kill me now.

232
16:55.303 --> 16:56.276
Sorry.

233
16:56.898 --> 16:58.598
Our pact forbids me to.

234
17:10.960 --> 17:12.380
Kiritsugu Emiya.

235
17:12.982 --> 17:16.217
I finally recognize you as
the lowly beast that you are.

236
17:16.797 --> 17:20.147
I believed that our paths differed,
but we shared a mutual goal.

237
17:20.500 --> 17:21.987
I was a fool to think this.

238
17:24.990 --> 17:28.587
Until now, I placed my faith in Irisviel's words,

239
17:29.087 --> 17:31.171
and thus did not doubt your intentions.

240
17:32.881 --> 17:33.754
But now...

241
17:34.972 --> 17:37.735
I can no longer believe that your desire for the Grail

242
17:38.422 --> 17:40.479
has anything to do with salvation.

243
17:41.514 --> 17:43.066
Answer me, Kiritsugu!

244
17:43.622 --> 17:45.999
What is the true reason you desire the Grail?

245
17:47.199 --> 17:50.376
Even should my sword at the
end of this war win the Grail.

246
17:50.929 --> 17:54.430
If that means I must yield it to you, I must...

247
17:55.790 --> 17:57.236
Answer her, Kiritsugu!

248
17:58.076 --> 18:01.622
After everything that has happened,
you owe her an explanation!

249
18:03.874 --> 18:07.693
You know, this incident is the very first time

250
18:08.167 --> 18:10.577
you've seen how I kill, Iris.

251
18:11.229 --> 18:13.398
If you only eliminate a master, the servant

252
18:13.731 --> 18:16.499
may enter into a pact with another party.

253
18:17.226 --> 18:21.158
So I had to eliminate the master
and the servant simultaneously.

254
18:21.378 --> 18:22.846
No, Kiritsugu.

255
18:23.073 --> 18:24.026
Not to me.

256
18:24.370 --> 18:25.541
Talk to Saber.

257
18:26.050 --> 18:29.027
She's the one who needs to hear your words now.

258
18:29.260 --> 18:29.895
No.

259
18:30.422 --> 18:31.704
Honor, glory...

260
18:32.310 --> 18:34.656
there's really no point in speaking to a killer

261
18:35.154 --> 18:37.431
who extols the virtue of such things.

262
18:37.731 --> 18:41.121
You would even insult chivalry to my face, monster!

263
18:42.203 --> 18:44.164
A knight cannot save the world.

264
18:45.178 --> 18:47.466
Knights call certain methods of fighting good,

265
18:47.895 --> 18:49.005
and others evil, acting as if

266
18:49.716 --> 18:52.975
there were some sacred nobility to the battlefield.

267
18:54.235 --> 18:57.629
Such illusions created by heroes throughout history

268
18:58.176 --> 19:00.686
have led countless young
men to their bloody deaths,

269
19:01.173 --> 19:04.862
all for the sake of this glory
and honor they all extol.

270
19:04.909 --> 19:06.449
They are not illusions!

271
19:06.795 --> 19:08.650
Even the taking of a life in battle

272
19:09.177 --> 19:11.092
as an act as a human being

273
19:11.419 --> 19:12.807
must have ideals,

274
19:13.487 --> 19:17.268
otherwise every war would bring the
very fires of hell to this world.

275
19:18.323 --> 19:19.443
And there you go...

276
19:20.138 --> 19:21.333
you heard her, Iris.

277
19:22.307 --> 19:26.674
Our heroic spirit over there considers
a battlefield to be better than hell.

278
19:27.742 --> 19:28.762
What a joke.

279
19:29.609 --> 19:31.682
A battlefield is hell itself.

280
19:32.428 --> 19:34.394
There's no hope to be had on one.

281
19:35.161 --> 19:37.520
There is nothing but unspeakable despair.

282
19:38.393 --> 19:40.579
Just a soulless cry we call victory.

283
19:41.079 --> 19:43.167
Paid for by the pain of the defeated.

284
19:43.734 --> 19:46.879
But humanity has never recognized this truth.

285
19:47.506 --> 19:52.682
And the reason is that in every era a dazzling hero
has blinded the people with their legends and kept

286
19:53.262 --> 19:56.146
them from seeing the evil of bloodshed they bring.

287
19:56.936 --> 20:01.799
True human nature has not advanced
a step beyond the Stone Age.

288
20:02.726 --> 20:04.289
Tell me this, Kiritsugu.

289
20:04.923 --> 20:07.336
Do you force Saber to endure such humiliation

290
20:07.771 --> 20:10.275
because of your hatred for the heroic spirits?

291
20:10.376 --> 20:11.626
Of course not.

292
20:12.228 --> 20:14.025
Personal feelings don't enter into it.

293
20:14.658 --> 20:17.143
I will win the Holy
Grail and save the world.

294
20:17.863 --> 20:19.278
And I will wage that war with the most

295
20:19.818 --> 20:22.333
appropriate weapons I have at my disposal.

296
20:23.779 --> 20:26.388
Justice and righteousness cannot save the world.

297
20:27.088 --> 20:28.632
I care nothing for such things.

298
20:29.338 --> 20:31.909
Kiritsugu, don't you understand?

299
20:32.603 --> 20:34.572
If you do evil to stop evil,

300
20:34.792 --> 20:38.942
that rage and hatred will
give rise to new conflict.

301
20:39.850 --> 20:41.117
Kiritsugu Emiya,

302
20:41.643 --> 20:45.668
I do not know what betrayed you,
or what has caused you to lose all hope,

303
20:46.335 --> 20:52.516
but your sorrow and rage are found only in
those who at one time sought for justice.

304
20:53.417 --> 20:56.494
Kiritsugu, in youth, your true self,

305
20:57.074 --> 20:59.013
wished to be a hero, did it not?

306
21:00.528 --> 21:02.103
A hero to save the world.

307
21:02.397 --> 21:05.232
You believed in that.
You desired it more than life.

308
21:05.872 --> 21:06.766
Am I wrong?

309
21:10.176 --> 21:12.071
I will break this endless cycle.

310
21:12.804 --> 21:14.579
The Grail will make that possible.

311
21:15.739 --> 21:20.220
I'll ensure that the blood I spill in Fuyuki
is the last that humanity will ever shed.

312
21:21.000 --> 21:24.401
If that means I must stain my
hands with every evil in the world,

313
21:24.948 --> 21:25.808
I don't care.

314
21:26.776 --> 21:28.369
If that will save the world,

315
21:29.422 --> 21:30.993
then I do it gladly.

316
21:40.212 --> 21:43.025
Kiritsugu has left, hasn't he?

317
21:43.816 --> 21:44.884
Irisviel?

318
21:50.142 --> 21:51.116
Irisviel!
