1
00:22.060 --> 00:23.140
Hurts, huh?

2
00:24.168 --> 00:27.499
Mages carry the pain of that crest forever.

3
00:30.550 --> 00:34.147
You know, I think your dad
really gave you the perfect name.

4
00:38.638 --> 00:41.860
Your origin is based on cutting and tying, kid.

5
00:42.486 --> 00:45.667
The nuance is a little different
than destroy and regenerate.

6
00:46.656 --> 00:48.764
If you cut a thread and then re‐tie it,

7
00:49.271 --> 00:50.726
it will be thicker where you cut it,

8
00:51.099 --> 00:52.279
isn't that right?

9
00:53.038 --> 00:57.160
In that sense, it carries a
connotation of irreversible change.

10
00:59.635 --> 01:02.736
Kiritsugu, with the characters for cut and tie,

11
01:04.006 --> 01:06.304
these will be your ace in the hole.

12
01:12.666 --> 01:15.747
I've powdered some of your ribs
and put a little bit in here.

13
01:16.441 --> 01:20.793
Your origin will materialize in
anything shot by this bullet.

14
01:21.720 --> 01:24.765
If your target attempts to use any magic against it,

15
01:25.245 --> 01:28.417
it will cut his circuits and thoroughly fry them.

16
01:29.364 --> 01:31.577
Just one shot will incapacitate him.

17
01:32.463 --> 01:34.460
I've made 66 in total.

18
01:34.880 --> 01:35.822
Don't waste them.

19
02:02.065 --> 02:04.408
Natalia, do you read me?

20
02:04.668 --> 02:05.782
I'm almost there.

21
02:06.155 --> 02:06.728
Roger.

22
02:17.364 --> 02:18.871
Natalia, do it.

23
02:40.452 --> 02:40.952
Huh?

24
03:01.091 --> 03:04.364
In the end, after leaving the island,

25
03:04.531 --> 03:08.565
I spent the next several years
living with Natalia Kaminski.

26
03:12.921 --> 03:15.441
That meant choosing the same path as Natalia.

27
03:16.780 --> 03:20.171
The solitary path of a highly skilled master hunter.

28
03:25.391 --> 03:27.664
Natalia belonged to no organization.

29
03:28.186 --> 03:29.846
She was a total freelancer,

30
03:30.399 --> 03:32.434
interested only in the money she could earn.

31
03:34.162 --> 03:36.670
The Mage's Association and the Church,

32
03:37.717 --> 03:40.618
the rivalry between those two enormous organizations

33
03:40.898 --> 03:42.298
kept her business booming.

34
04:39.542 --> 04:40.616
During that time,

35
04:41.391 --> 04:44.692
I witnessed many tragedies
like the one on Arimago Island.

36
04:46.652 --> 04:49.795
I also learned that all around the world

37
04:50.037 --> 04:51.539
on every single continent,

38
04:52.092 --> 04:53.919
the same horrors happened every day.

39
05:18.288 --> 05:19.174
Just missed.

40
05:35.001 --> 05:37.530
Are you trying to be a hero or something?

41
05:45.655 --> 05:47.115
Was there no meaning to it?

42
05:48.592 --> 05:49.432
I thought... 

43
05:50.434 --> 05:54.065
I thought I had killed my father to
keep more people like them from dying.

44
05:56.466 --> 05:58.774
Killing merely one man isn't the solution.

45
05:58.947 --> 06:00.022
It's not that simple.

46
06:01.689 --> 06:05.494
Kill every single person all around
the world who's like our target here.

47
06:05.854 --> 06:08.049
If you could somehow manage to do that,

48
06:08.321 --> 06:10.133
maybe it would be possible.

49
06:23.484 --> 06:26.801
No matter what happens, do whatever you must to survive.

50
06:27.288 --> 06:30.658
That's a rule I set for myself when
I got started in this business.

51
06:31.058 --> 06:34.935
Regardless of what you face,
put your own life ahead of anything or anyone.

52
06:39.369 --> 06:43.736
Look, kid, if you try to save someone and you
get yourself killed, it'll all be for nothing.

53
06:45.456 --> 06:48.722
I don't think it's possible to save everyone.

54
06:50.954 --> 06:54.551
But I do want to save as many as I possibly can.

55
06:55.791 --> 06:57.530
Well, suit yourself.

56
07:15.060 --> 07:17.866
This target really is a nasty piece of work.

57
07:18.280 --> 07:19.406
Do you know him?

58
07:20.243 --> 07:22.030
The Mage Odd Vorzak.

59
07:22.915 --> 07:26.861
He's a Dead Apostle who uses his
bee familiars to create his ghouls.

60
07:27.395 --> 07:30.702
The Mage's Association has
put a huge bounty on his head.

61
07:31.122 --> 07:32.435
You know a lot about him.

62
07:35.537 --> 07:37.818
He causes destruction wherever he goes.

63
07:38.673 --> 07:42.743
The last town he visited was
completely and utterly annihilated.

64
07:43.137 --> 07:44.070
Our town.

65
07:54.441 --> 07:57.174
Natalia, can I have one of those too?

66
07:58.909 --> 08:01.737
How old do you have to be in
your country to smoke tobacco?

67
08:02.204 --> 08:05.392
I won't try to stop you,
but they aren't good for you.

68
08:19.503 --> 08:20.889
What's his destination?

69
08:22.196 --> 08:24.680
There's a flight from Paris to New York in four days.

70
08:24.987 --> 08:26.726
Vorzak will be on board.

71
08:27.567 --> 08:29.361
I'll be handling this myself.

72
08:29.876 --> 08:33.286
This guy is a clever target who
managed to give me the slip once.

73
08:34.526 --> 08:36.779
You gotta clean up your own messes, right?

74
08:37.440 --> 08:39.554
So, even you fail sometimes?

75
08:39.747 --> 08:41.871
That should tell you how tough he really is.

76
08:47.863 --> 08:48.935
What should I do?

77
08:50.042 --> 08:53.789
I'm fairly certain he has associates
working for him in New York.

78
08:54.742 --> 08:56.873
I want you to go there and eliminate them.

79
08:59.067 --> 09:00.754
Then you'll fight Vorzak alone.

80
09:01.902 --> 09:05.014
He can't keep his bees with him
in a carry‐on when he flies.

81
09:06.133 --> 09:06.988
I see.

82
09:07.663 --> 09:09.827
There's no risk of him getting away from you this time.

83
09:10.967 --> 09:12.287
Shut your mouth, kid.

84
09:23.058 --> 09:24.572
Kid, do you copy?

85
09:26.979 --> 09:27.788
Roger.

86
09:28.188 --> 09:29.054
Loud and clear.

87
09:30.683 --> 09:33.211
All right, good luck to both of us then.

88
10:37.700 --> 10:39.947
That was much easier than I expected.

89
10:40.827 --> 10:45.207
Yes, well, I'm just glad you were able
to kill him with a minimum of force.

90
10:55.022 --> 10:56.317
All right, Kiritsugu,

91
10:56.657 --> 10:58.597
his corpse is in the passenger cabin.

92
10:59.024 --> 11:00.389
Are you ready to carry it out?

93
11:01.676 --> 11:02.771
I've secured a vehicle.

94
11:04.084 --> 11:06.339
The only thing we need now is a doctor

95
11:06.699 --> 11:08.379
who will carry out our sick patient.

96
11:09.749 --> 11:11.896
I don't have a license, but that's okay.

97
11:28.357 --> 11:29.005
Hey.

98
11:30.167 --> 11:31.707
Natalia, what's wrong?

99
11:32.880 --> 11:33.573
A ghoul!

100
11:38.502 --> 11:40.096
We have a big problem here.

101
11:42.888 --> 11:46.292
He was keeping the bees inside of his own body.

102
11:48.158 --> 11:49.963
Natalia, you have to get out.

103
11:50.322 --> 11:52.461
I'm not exactly close to the ground here.

104
11:53.229 --> 11:55.409
I didn't come prepared to sky dive out of here.

105
12:00.163 --> 12:01.169
This isn't good.

106
12:01.323 --> 12:03.142
Looks like they've taken the cockpit.

107
12:11.599 --> 12:12.759
I've got no choice.

108
12:15.956 --> 12:18.036
Natalia, what are you gonna do?

109
12:19.619 --> 12:20.839
I am coming home.

110
12:21.239 --> 12:22.592
I'm coming home alive

111
12:23.336 --> 12:25.036
carrying Vorzak's body.

112
12:25.833 --> 12:28.315
But first I need to do something about this plane.

113
12:31.141 --> 12:32.460
You got something to say?

114
12:33.455 --> 12:34.235
Yeah.

115
12:34.819 --> 12:36.126
You can do this, Natalia.

116
12:37.517 --> 12:38.197
That'll do.

117
12:38.490 --> 12:40.854
Prepare a nice warm bed for me and wait.

118
13:01.559 --> 13:03.759
Hey, kid, do you read me?

119
13:04.113 --> 13:05.713
You didn't fall asleep, did you?

120
13:06.099 --> 13:08.140
Reading you loud and clear, Natalia.

121
13:08.876 --> 13:10.116
We've both been up all night.

122
13:10.502 --> 13:11.505
It's a rough morning.

123
13:12.003 --> 13:15.343
If you'd slept in a bad last
night with me stuck up here,

124
13:15.407 --> 13:17.594
I would have to kill
you after this is over.

125
13:17.893 --> 13:21.706
Now, I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want first?

126
13:22.439 --> 13:25.474
Isn't it a rule that you always
start with the good news?

127
13:26.223 --> 13:27.056
Okay.

128
13:27.836 --> 13:29.782
I guess I'll start with the good news then.

129
13:30.494 --> 13:32.445
For the time being, I'm alive.

130
13:32.818 --> 13:35.231
The plane is also undamaged.

131
13:36.237 --> 13:38.148
I made it up to the cockpit fairly easy,

132
13:38.721 --> 13:41.152
though repairing the comms array wasn't easy at all.

133
13:42.540 --> 13:47.047
I also think I can pilot it, assuming
the controls are similar to a Cessna.

134
13:47.914 --> 13:49.762
Have you contacted the control tower?

135
13:49.953 --> 13:50.609
I have.

136
13:50.966 --> 13:53.674
At first they thought I was
pulling some kind of prank.

137
13:54.341 --> 13:57.553
Those kind folks say they'll escort me in.

138
13:58.853 --> 13:59.507
All right.

139
14:00.252 --> 14:02.247
And the bad news?

140
14:02.681 --> 14:05.538
I'm the only one here who hasn't been bitten or stung.

141
14:05.922 --> 14:10.068
300 passengers and crew, they're all ghouls now.

142
14:10.947 --> 14:14.443
All that separates me from the
Night of the Living Flying Dead

143
14:14.773 --> 14:17.003
is the damn cockpit security door.

144
14:17.863 --> 14:18.923
Spooky, right?

145
14:20.871 --> 14:22.717
Given everything you've just told me,

146
14:23.257 --> 14:25.255
will you be able to make it out of this alive?

147
14:25.944 --> 14:28.479
Well, the cockpit door is actually pretty tough.

148
14:29.254 --> 14:31.127
They're scratching at it as we speak,

149
14:31.595 --> 14:33.497
but they can't seem to break it down.

150
14:34.357 --> 14:36.525
It's the landing that's worrying me.

151
14:36.999 --> 14:40.279
This thing may be too big for me to handle by myself.

152
14:41.502 --> 14:44.694
Natalia, I know you'll be able to manage it.

153
14:47.079 --> 14:48.792
Were those words of encouragement?

154
14:49.026 --> 14:50.561
It's good to hear them from you.

155
14:53.013 --> 14:54.613
I can handle the landing.

156
14:55.346 --> 14:58.269
But what do I do with all these monsters in back?

157
14:59.233 --> 14:59.729
Hm.

158
15:00.642 --> 15:01.744
Don't worry about that.

159
15:02.444 --> 15:04.252
I have it all worked out, Natalia.

160
15:05.073 --> 15:05.559
Hm?

161
15:08.300 --> 15:09.820
I can always count on you.

162
15:10.020 --> 15:12.359
50 more minutes till we get to the airport.

163
15:12.752 --> 15:14.949
That's a little bit too long to spend praying.

164
15:15.216 --> 15:18.102
Kid, keep me company for a while, okay?

165
15:18.503 --> 15:19.559
I can do that.

166
15:48.283 --> 15:51.589
Way back when you first said you
wanted to help me with my work,

167
15:52.331 --> 15:54.244
I really didn't know how to respond.

168
15:55.193 --> 15:58.248
You just didn't look ready to
relent no matter what I said.

169
15:59.076 --> 16:02.727
So, I showed that little promise as a student?

170
16:03.233 --> 16:04.690
No, it's not that.

171
16:05.097 --> 16:06.725
You had a lot of potential.

172
16:07.365 --> 16:08.265
Too much.

173
16:08.638 --> 16:09.995
What does that mean?

174
16:10.962 --> 16:14.369
The ability to pull a trigger to
kill regardless of your feelings

175
16:14.923 --> 16:19.377
is a skill most killers take
many years to fully develop.

176
16:20.099 --> 16:22.452
You had that skill from the very start.

177
16:22.745 --> 16:24.127
It's a hell of a gift.

178
16:25.262 --> 16:31.618
But choosing your occupation based solely on your
talents doesn't necessarily guarantee your happiness.

179
16:33.084 --> 16:37.812
If you think only of what you should do
and completely ignore what you want to do,

180
16:38.585 --> 16:42.059
then you're just a simple
machine, a force of nature.

181
16:42.694 --> 16:45.009
That isn't how a human being should live.

182
16:47.003 --> 16:48.222
I'm surprised.

183
16:48.717 --> 16:51.863
You know, I always thought of you
as a much colder person than that.

184
16:52.083 --> 16:54.626
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm cold.

185
16:54.966 --> 16:59.076
In all these years, have I ever
spoiled you or coddled you even once?

186
16:59.443 --> 17:02.733
True, you've always been a rather strict teacher.

187
17:03.635 --> 17:05.341
You never held anything back

188
17:06.107 --> 17:07.527
and taught me what you could.

189
17:10.986 --> 17:15.144
Under normal circumstances,
training a boy like you is the father's job.

190
17:16.518 --> 17:18.406
But...well...

191
17:21.838 --> 17:23.460
I'm afraid that in your case

192
17:23.540 --> 17:26.788
I basically took away your chance
for that kind of upbringing.

193
17:28.194 --> 17:29.396
Anyway, I...

194
17:30.056 --> 17:32.113
I did feel a little bad about it.

195
17:33.484 --> 17:37.254
This was the only way of life I knew how to teach you.

196
17:38.387 --> 17:41.169
So you consider yourself my dad?

197
17:41.788 --> 17:44.596
I'm a full‐grown woman, you rude little jerk.

198
17:45.063 --> 17:46.627
At least call me mother.

199
17:47.720 --> 17:48.447
You're right.

200
17:48.933 --> 17:49.599
Sorry.

201
17:50.767 --> 17:54.715
I spent an awfully long time on
my own in this bloody business.

202
17:55.409 --> 17:59.121
So long that I even lost track
of the fact that I was alone.

203
17:59.721 --> 18:04.079
But...it's been pretty entertaining in its own way,

204
18:04.346 --> 18:06.563
having something like a family in my life.

205
18:07.241 --> 18:08.181
For me too.

206
18:09.082 --> 18:10.289
For all these years,

207
18:10.802 --> 18:12.943
I did always think of you as a mother.

208
18:13.890 --> 18:16.340
I was happy to have you.

209
18:16.929 --> 18:23.063
Look, kid, I think we'd better quit saying stuff
that'll embarrass us next time we see each other, okay?

210
18:25.583 --> 18:26.957
You're throwing me off my game.

211
18:27.337 --> 18:29.494
I've got to land this thing in 20 minutes or so.

212
18:30.017 --> 18:34.859
If I'm laughing over what we were just talking
about and screw up, I'll end up dead, you know?

213
18:36.829 --> 18:38.913
Sorry, I'll stop.

214
18:42.433 --> 18:46.540
You know, maybe I'm just getting too old for this job.

215
18:46.953 --> 18:49.346
Maybe the reason I screwed up so badly

216
18:50.066 --> 18:53.318
is because playing at having a
family made me lower my guard.

217
18:54.284 --> 18:56.335
If that's true, I should walk away.

218
18:57.181 --> 18:58.803
Maybe it's time to retire.

219
19:00.184 --> 19:01.555
If you quit this job,

220
19:02.229 --> 19:03.482
what would you do with your life?

221
19:04.677 --> 19:05.930
If I weren't working...

222
19:07.787 --> 19:09.653
The only thing left for me to do

223
19:09.847 --> 19:12.401
would be to really act like a mother, I guess.

224
19:28.192 --> 19:29.518
Natalia, you are...

225
19:32.482 --> 19:34.464
...my real family.

226
20:19.541 --> 20:21.829
Did you see that, Shirley?

227
20:26.846 --> 20:28.365
I killed someone again,

228
20:29.183 --> 20:30.938
just like I did with my dad.

229
20:31.915 --> 20:34.202
I didn't screw up like I did with you.

230
20:34.526 --> 20:37.209
I saved an awful lot of lives.

231
20:39.029 --> 20:41.631
If Natalia had landed that plane safely,

232
20:42.386 --> 20:44.614
there's no telling how many people

233
20:46.314 --> 20:47.107
might have died.

234
20:52.460 --> 20:55.144
Her sacrifice prevented all of that.

235
20:56.619 --> 20:57.592
So I...

236
20:58.383 --> 20:59.165
So I...

237
21:00.594 --> 21:03.051
Shirley, I...

238
21:11.983 --> 21:12.825
Shut your mouth.

239
21:12.919 --> 21:14.079
Just shut up.

240
21:14.465 --> 21:16.184
Bastard!

241
21:26.993 --> 21:28.192
Tell me, Kerry,

242
21:28.912 --> 21:30.542
what do you want to grow up to be?

243
21:32.864 --> 21:33.604
I...

244
21:41.423 --> 21:42.520
I want to...
