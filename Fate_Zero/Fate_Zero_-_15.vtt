1
00:16.072 --> 00:18.014
What are we gonna do now, Rider?

2
00:18.913 --> 00:19.567
Hmm.

3
00:31.253 --> 00:31.967
Hmm.

4
00:38.223 --> 00:40.043
So what now, Mad Dog?

5
00:49.193 --> 00:50.649
Tokiomi.

6
00:55.580 --> 00:58.100
I'll kill you, bastard.

7
01:14.845 --> 01:15.712
Saber!

8
01:25.267 --> 01:26.853
They can't make it through.

9
01:30.454 --> 01:32.974
If only Saber could use her left hand.

10
03:04.442 --> 03:05.721
Hey, Saber!

11
03:06.281 --> 03:08.041
We're not getting anywhere like this!

12
03:08.288 --> 03:09.432
Let us withdraw!

13
03:09.733 --> 03:10.893
Don't be a fool!

14
03:11.260 --> 03:12.950
We must stop its advance!

15
03:13.584 --> 03:16.139
That may well be, but we're in a stalemate!

16
03:16.385 --> 03:17.863
Just fall back for now!

17
03:18.268 --> 03:19.378
I have an idea!

18
03:26.107 --> 03:27.082
Listen, everyone.

19
03:27.828 --> 03:29.735
Whatever strategy we devise tonight,

20
03:29.832 --> 03:32.207
we first need to buy some time to organize it.

21
03:33.107 --> 03:36.822
For the time being, I will drag
that beast into my Ionian Hetairoi,

22
03:37.428 --> 03:40.303
but it will be impossible for my elite troops to slay it

23
03:40.643 --> 03:42.758
even if they attack in full force.

24
03:43.273 --> 03:46.614
The best we can hope for is to halt
its advance within the Reality Marble.

25
03:47.592 --> 03:48.598
And after that?

26
03:49.488 --> 03:50.635
No idea.

27
03:50.895 --> 03:51.702
Huh?

28
03:52.161 --> 03:54.334
After swallowing something as big as that,

29
03:54.767 --> 03:59.066
my bounded field and its army will
only hold for a matter of mere minutes.

30
03:59.486 --> 04:02.002
In that short time, we must act.

31
04:02.417 --> 04:06.835
Heroic spirits, I want you to
find some way for us to prevail.

32
04:08.395 --> 04:09.630
Boy, disembark!

33
04:10.123 --> 04:11.560
You're staying here with them.

34
04:12.427 --> 04:13.100
Huh?

35
04:15.302 --> 04:16.123
Hey!

36
04:17.021 --> 04:21.586
Once my reality marble is deployed,
I will not know what is going on in the outside world,

37
04:22.388 --> 04:25.634
and so if anything happens, concentrate and call to me.

38
04:26.458 --> 04:27.785
I'll send a messenger to you.

39
04:33.664 --> 04:34.764
Saber and Lancer,

40
04:35.211 --> 04:36.331
the rest is up to you.

41
04:36.944 --> 04:37.824
Right.

42
04:38.212 --> 04:39.245
Understood.

43
04:39.767 --> 04:40.574
Yah!

44
05:03.084 --> 05:04.931
You only prolong the inevitable.

45
05:17.634 --> 05:18.367
Mom!

46
05:27.022 --> 05:28.162
What is that?

47
06:07.625 --> 06:12.515
How does plunging headfirst into that
filthy creature sound to you, you mongrel?

48
06:45.477 --> 06:48.058
After all that raging and ranting against me.

49
06:49.347 --> 06:52.250
When it comes time to act, this is all you can do?

50
06:58.184 --> 07:00.024
Is he trying to kill himself?

51
07:00.867 --> 07:04.240
Kariya, consider this an act of mercy.

52
07:04.740 --> 07:07.046
Intensive, Einäscherung

53
07:16.152 --> 07:18.494
I can't kill you.

54
07:19.087 --> 07:21.007
I'll kill you.

55
07:22.268 --> 07:23.605
Tokiomi...

56
07:42.422 --> 07:44.188
What now?

57
07:44.655 --> 07:46.915
I know he said he'd buy us some time,
but if we don't think of something really fast,

58
07:47.455 --> 07:49.255
We'll be right back where we started.

59
07:49.617 --> 07:51.115
Come on now, Einzbern.

60
07:51.721 --> 07:53.118
Don't you have any ideas?

61
07:54.271 --> 07:55.398
Say something!

62
07:59.998 --> 08:01.159
Wait a minute.

63
08:01.779 --> 08:03.645
I don't know how to use this.

64
08:05.678 --> 08:06.353
Iri.

65
08:06.948 --> 08:09.557
Um, no, I'm... wait, who is this?

66
08:09.830 --> 08:13.140
Ah, well, you must be Rider's master.

67
08:13.478 --> 08:14.213
Good timing.

68
08:14.428 --> 08:16.100
There's something I wanna discuss with you.

69
08:16.388 --> 08:18.301
Who... who are you?

70
08:18.570 --> 08:19.756
That's not important.

71
08:20.449 --> 08:23.976
Caster's disappearance...
I gather that was your servant's doing?

72
08:24.663 --> 08:26.644
That's right, basically.

73
08:27.184 --> 08:31.165
Question... Rider's reality marble, when he releases it,

74
08:31.585 --> 08:34.133
can he put down the contents in a specific area?

75
08:36.408 --> 08:37.483
To a point.

76
08:37.788 --> 08:40.442
He can get within 100 meters or so, I think.

77
08:40.588 --> 08:41.731
It should be possible.

78
08:42.444 --> 08:46.285
Rider has control over where
he enters back into this world.

79
08:46.858 --> 08:47.598
Good enough.

80
08:48.289 --> 08:51.312
When the timing seems like it's
right, I'll send up a flare.

81
08:52.399 --> 08:54.272
Release Caster directly underneath it.

82
08:54.752 --> 08:55.612
Can you do that?

83
08:55.847 --> 08:58.777
I can, probably, I think.

84
08:59.270 --> 09:02.054
One more thing... give this message to Lancer.

85
09:02.471 --> 09:06.541
Tell him Saber's left hand contains
an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

86
09:06.948 --> 09:07.714
Huh?

87
09:11.570 --> 09:12.644
Something the matter?

88
09:13.104 --> 09:15.998
Well, he asked me to give you a message.

89
09:16.156 --> 09:19.322
Saber's left hand has an anti‐fortress Noble Phantasm.

90
09:22.538 --> 09:24.534
Is this true, Saber?

91
09:27.838 --> 09:28.774
I see.

92
09:29.462 --> 09:33.064
Do you think it's capable of
obliterating Caster's monster?

93
09:34.204 --> 09:35.137
I believe so.

94
09:37.027 --> 09:40.791
But Lancer, my blade and my pride are the same.

95
09:41.526 --> 09:45.538
This wound you inflicted on me
is a mark of pride, not shame.

96
09:46.571 --> 09:50.004
If that loss was the price of
securing Diarmuid Ua Duibhne's aid,

97
09:50.412 --> 09:52.232
then it was worth a veritable host.

98
09:58.405 --> 09:59.519
Listen, Saber,

99
10:00.027 --> 10:01.960
I cannot abide this Caster.

100
10:02.653 --> 10:07.294
He finds the despair of others both right and
good and takes pleasure in spreading terror.

101
10:07.434 --> 10:08.922
On my word as a knight,

102
10:09.142 --> 10:12.255
his is an evil that I cannot let go unchallenged.

103
10:14.992 --> 10:16.884
Lancer, no, you mustn't do that!

104
10:17.351 --> 10:20.948
Must it be Saber who is victorious today or Lancer?

105
10:21.352 --> 10:23.432
No, it is neither of us.

106
10:23.912 --> 10:27.688
What must triumph here today is the path of chivalry.

107
10:28.108 --> 10:30.749
Agreed, heroic Arturia?

108
10:44.578 --> 10:45.338
Lancer.

109
10:46.312 --> 10:50.146
I entrust our victory to the single
strike of the King of Knights.

110
10:50.586 --> 10:53.099
I'm counting on you, brave Saber.

111
10:56.518 --> 11:01.735
Rest assured, Lancer. Upon my blade, I will prevail!

112
11:15.958 --> 11:18.918
That is from the Arthurian legends.

113
11:26.567 --> 11:27.669
Saber!

114
11:27.837 --> 11:28.862
Berserker?

115
11:29.128 --> 11:30.015
Why now?

116
11:52.485 --> 11:55.738
You dare turn your back on me, you lowly mongrel?

117
11:56.068 --> 11:57.105
Blasphemy!

118
11:58.828 --> 11:59.362
What?

119
12:09.407 --> 12:10.067
Saber!

120
12:10.323 --> 12:12.327
What the hell does Berserker think he's doing?

121
12:12.740 --> 12:15.588
I've finally regained the use
of my left hand and now this.

122
12:38.290 --> 12:40.758
Regardless of its own self awareness of this fact,

123
12:41.005 --> 12:43.862
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

124
12:45.288 --> 12:47.201
He was the only one you ordered Assassin

125
12:47.681 --> 12:51.807
to investigate thoroughly enough such that
you could understand those circumstances.

126
12:52.912 --> 12:55.830
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

127
13:40.313 --> 13:41.474
Still too soon.

128
13:43.323 --> 13:44.762
What are all these tremors?

129
13:46.039 --> 13:50.360
An omen that Rider's reality marble
is approaching its limits, I imagine.

130
13:51.623 --> 13:52.646
Come, Rider.

131
13:57.382 --> 13:59.831
I am Mithrenes, Soldier of the Hetairoi.

132
14:00.846 --> 14:04.223
I have come here to act as my king's eyes and ears.

133
14:06.455 --> 14:09.041
Tell him to wait for our signal,

134
14:09.555 --> 14:13.093
then release the bounded field and
dump Caster at the designated location.

135
14:14.047 --> 14:14.773
Can you do it?

136
14:15.450 --> 14:19.247
We can, sir, but it will be a race against time.

137
14:20.094 --> 14:22.240
We of the Hetairoi are no longer able

138
14:22.826 --> 14:26.058
to slow the progress of that
horror within the bounded field.

139
14:26.598 --> 14:27.813
I understand that!

140
14:28.093 --> 14:29.260
I know!

141
14:33.795 --> 14:35.109
Damn that Berserker!

142
14:35.453 --> 14:37.250
Can't we do anything about him?

143
14:37.543 --> 14:38.597
Allow me.

144
14:39.753 --> 14:40.539
Lancer!

145
14:46.321 --> 14:48.807
I am putting an end to this mad warrior!

146
15:05.653 --> 15:06.855
It's all or nothing.

147
15:20.253 --> 15:20.887
Archer!

148
15:39.813 --> 15:40.636
There it is!

149
15:41.116 --> 15:42.143
Right under there.

150
15:42.168 --> 15:42.896
Yes, sir.

151
16:01.703 --> 16:04.583
Finally... what took them so damn long?

152
16:15.669 --> 16:16.305
Oh.

153
16:22.603 --> 16:25.199
All right now, Saber, show me your best!

154
16:25.586 --> 16:28.427
I shall judge your worth as a heroic spirit

155
16:28.753 --> 16:30.582
with my own two eyes!

156
16:53.053 --> 16:54.117
The light.

157
16:54.843 --> 16:56.057
It shines bright.

158
16:56.601 --> 16:58.147
It is the true embodiment

159
16:58.666 --> 17:01.599
of the sad yet noble dream of all soldiers

160
17:02.139 --> 17:05.976
past, present, and future who lie
dying on the fields of battle,

161
17:06.682 --> 17:09.346
clutched to their hearts with their last breath,

162
17:10.839 --> 17:15.866
holding aloft their dying wish,
making certain that their loyalty will not be in vain.

163
17:16.573 --> 17:20.329
The invincible king is about to cry out the true name

164
17:20.443 --> 17:22.944
of the miracle she wields in her hands.

165
17:30.838 --> 17:31.745
That name is...

166
17:33.218 --> 17:37.806
Excalibur!

167
17:57.569 --> 17:58.995
This brilliant light!

168
18:13.768 --> 18:17.054
There is no doubt, this is the light

169
18:17.181 --> 18:21.414
from when Jean and I were
blessed with such profound joy!

170
18:33.390 --> 18:37.386
What...have I...

171
19:04.978 --> 19:07.275
Did you see that, King of Conquerors?

172
19:07.589 --> 19:09.872
Such is Saber's brilliant skill.

173
19:10.452 --> 19:12.547
Having seen such light,

174
19:12.901 --> 19:15.609
you still refuse to grant her your respect?

175
19:16.102 --> 19:21.898
Hmm... that light is a result of her accepting
the hopes and dreams of the people of her time.

176
19:22.891 --> 19:24.872
It hurts me because it's so bright.

177
19:26.287 --> 19:28.127
And because I know that this burden

178
19:28.754 --> 19:31.457
was thrust upon the shoulders of a little girl.

179
19:32.604 --> 19:36.246
What I see is what became of a girl
who was never allowed to admire

180
19:36.271 --> 19:38.785
butterflies or flowers or fall in love,

181
19:39.233 --> 19:42.373
but was instead taken hold of by the curse of ideals.

182
19:43.808 --> 19:45.872
It is too painful to look upon.

183
19:47.235 --> 19:49.668
Which is exactly what makes her so endearing... 

184
19:50.295 --> 19:52.857
the unattainable dream she held so dear

185
19:53.188 --> 19:57.350
was certain to explode in a brilliant
flare that would burn her to ash.

186
19:57.970 --> 20:00.763
The tears of bitter lamentation she shed,

187
20:01.653 --> 20:04.724
how sweet they'd have tasted as she laid there dying.

188
20:05.590 --> 20:10.511
You and I will never get along,
Babylonian King of Heroes.

189
20:10.708 --> 20:11.411
Really?

190
20:11.824 --> 20:13.961
You only now realized that fact?

191
20:14.538 --> 20:16.576
What are you going to do, Rider?

192
20:17.240 --> 20:20.957
Perhaps give vent to your righteous anger here and now?

193
20:21.277 --> 20:23.876
It would give me great pleasure were I to do so.

194
20:24.529 --> 20:29.554
But if you and I were to do battle, it would mean
expending more energy tonight than I would care to.

195
20:30.705 --> 20:35.637
Of course, if you were to decide that you
couldn't pass up the chance to attack,

196
20:35.957 --> 20:38.025
I would be forced to respond in kind.

197
20:38.689 --> 20:41.860
This once, I shall allow you to escape.

198
20:43.023 --> 20:45.474
There would be no satisfaction in crushing you

199
20:45.860 --> 20:47.240
if you were not in your prime.

200
20:49.406 --> 20:54.569
Or is it that you yourself are injured from
being shot down by that ridiculous lunatic?

201
20:55.684 --> 20:58.303
I respond to provocation with death.

202
20:59.214 --> 21:02.213
We'll save it for next time, King of Heroes.

203
21:02.674 --> 21:07.899
Ours will be the epic battle that will determine
who is the champion of the Holy Grail War.

204
21:13.237 --> 21:14.483
Don't be so certain.

205
21:15.294 --> 21:21.826
I have yet to decide if there is but one who is
worthy of the gift of my greatest treasure, Rider.

206
21:23.836 --> 21:28.470
You glorious fool who strives to achieve
that which man was not meant to have.

207
21:29.283 --> 21:32.708
In all of Heaven and Earth, none but I, Gilgamesh,

208
21:32.940 --> 21:35.486
can truly appreciate your destruction.

209
21:40.069 --> 21:43.813
You who shine so brightly yet so briefly,

210
21:44.028 --> 21:45.663
come to my arms.

211
21:46.050 --> 21:48.080
This I have decided.

212
23:25.938 --> 23:27.698
I am first Bure of Fianna,

213
23:27.698 --> 23:29.238
Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.

214
23:29.238 --> 23:32.448
Saber, I am glad I was able to meet you.

215
23:32.448 --> 23:34.828
Splendid... for this night,

216
23:34.828 --> 23:37.618
Arturia Pendragon accepts your challenge.

217
23:37.618 --> 23:39.918
‐Come then! ‐I come for you!
