00:49.429 --> 00:50.177
Ah!

2
00:51.639 --> 00:52.083
What?

3
00:52.689 --> 00:53.596
Ah!

4
01:08.279 --> 01:08.934
Rin.

5
02:55.798 --> 02:56.712
Hey!

6
02:57.857 --> 03:01.241
You losers shouldn't gang up on
someone and bully them like that!

7
03:01.607 --> 03:04.229
You guys suck, you really suck!

8
03:04.335 --> 03:07.583
What's your problem, Tohsaka?
There's nothing here that concerns you.

9
03:08.148 --> 03:11.462
Yeah, in that case, why don't you do the same to me?

10
03:11.655 --> 03:13.984
And then it will concern me.

11
03:16.227 --> 03:19.216
Come on, this is getting lame.

12
03:22.738 --> 03:23.658
Here.

13
03:29.217 --> 03:31.541
You used too much mana all at once.

14
03:32.649 --> 03:34.335
Maintain a calm mind.

15
03:34.795 --> 03:39.752
In order to control magic, you must first
achieve complete control of your thoughts.

16
03:45.485 --> 03:50.093
Lose control and the mana will
suddenly rebound back to your body.

17
03:51.535 --> 03:57.027
Too much power or power in the wrong form will
endanger not only you, but those around you.

18
03:57.926 --> 04:00.948
Strive to consistently maintain the proper flow.

19
04:01.381 --> 04:03.538
That is the Tohsaka family motto.

20
04:04.804 --> 04:07.004
It means always remaining reserved

21
04:07.538 --> 04:08.544
and elegant.

22
04:12.933 --> 04:15.715
You shouldn't let them get way
with it when they try that stuff.

23
04:15.943 --> 04:19.547
If they're in the wrong, you just have
to get mad and do something about it.

24
04:20.042 --> 04:23.258
You're amazing, Rin,
the way you always speak your mind like that.

25
04:23.563 --> 04:24.756
I'm not amazing at all.

26
04:24.925 --> 04:27.565
I think it's normal.
I mean, it's only natural.

27
04:29.679 --> 04:32.097
That's right, it's only natural.

28
04:40.324 --> 04:41.402
Hold out your hand.

29
04:44.238 --> 04:45.539
Oh.

30
04:45.961 --> 04:48.321
Father, oh please teach me more.

31
04:48.876 --> 04:50.869
How do I make something like this?

32
04:51.564 --> 04:55.119
Well, my dear, that might be a
bit difficult for you right now.

33
04:57.107 --> 04:59.757
But if you work hard every day,

34
04:59.864 --> 05:01.748
you'll be able to make it eventually.

35
05:03.472 --> 05:07.262
After all, Rin, you're a daughter of the Tohsaka family.

36
05:16.421 --> 05:19.912
Hey, Rin, could you please
show me how to do this part?

37
05:20.132 --> 05:21.595
Of course, which part?

38
05:22.028 --> 05:23.135
Yeah, me too.

39
05:23.315 --> 05:24.371
Me too.

40
05:24.704 --> 05:27.790
Oh, this was on page 23 of the textbook.

41
05:28.703 --> 05:31.031
You see, you just did the math wrong here.

42
05:31.291 --> 05:33.930
For this problem, it's just like this example, see?

43
05:40.076 --> 05:44.298
Kotone, have a seat, I'll help everyone in turn.

44
05:45.048 --> 05:46.013
Okay.

45
06:04.305 --> 06:07.298
Do I really have to go and live with the Zenjo family?

46
06:08.117 --> 06:12.937
Once the Holy Grail War begins,
it will no longer be safe for you in Fuyuki.

47
06:14.298 --> 06:18.501
But I... but I want to do something to
help you with the Grail War, Father.

48
06:18.795 --> 06:21.870
Rin, you mustn't cause trouble for your father.

49
06:22.345 --> 06:24.676
Do you think that we're in the way?

50
06:25.008 --> 06:26.075
Not at all.

51
06:26.820 --> 06:30.707
Please try to understand,
I need to make preparations for the battle.

52
06:31.764 --> 06:35.911
Those preparations include doing
what's necessary to ensure your safety.

53
06:36.848 --> 06:40.468
And for me to do that,
you simply can't stay in Fuyuki.

54
06:42.297 --> 06:45.205
But I'm certain there's
something I can do to help!

55
06:52.582 --> 06:55.655
That's right, I just haven't learned how to yet.

56
06:56.477 --> 06:59.187
So, all I need to do is study on my own.

57
07:04.036 --> 07:06.123
I don't understand any of this.

58
07:06.522 --> 07:08.180
What is this?

59
07:08.497 --> 07:09.540
Tease!

60
07:11.374 --> 07:12.174
Oh.

61
07:26.390 --> 07:27.656
I have to close it.

62
07:32.626 --> 07:34.492
It won't move.

63
07:38.091 --> 07:38.951
Rin!

64
07:40.089 --> 07:41.602
Are you all right?

65
07:50.711 --> 07:53.055
It's still too soon for you to read this book.

66
07:53.588 --> 07:57.927
Some things in this world contain their own mana.

67
08:05.209 --> 08:12.278
This is called a mana compass. Normally, it doesn't
point to anything except for mana traces in the area.

68
08:13.205 --> 08:16.015
Rin, try generating mana in this.

69
08:16.355 --> 08:17.162
Okay.

70
08:22.213 --> 08:23.425
Ah.

71
08:24.133 --> 08:24.982
You see?

72
08:25.779 --> 08:27.487
And with that book.

73
08:30.204 --> 08:34.974
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

74
08:35.441 --> 08:36.207
Ah.

75
08:36.440 --> 08:39.969
I'll give this to you as an early birthday present.

76
08:41.006 --> 08:43.598
Oh, thank you so much, Father.

77
08:44.018 --> 08:48.984
Once the Holy Grail War is all over,
you and I will try some real jewel magic.

78
08:52.063 --> 08:54.591
And then strange things began to happen.

79
09:05.013 --> 09:07.041
They said we have study hall again.

80
09:10.713 --> 09:12.848
There was another kidnapping on the news this morning.

81
09:12.873 --> 09:14.263
...the sudden disappearance of children

82
09:14.263 --> 09:16.143
has police investigators baffled.

83
09:16.143 --> 09:18.603
The teachers have been in a meeting all day.

84
09:18.603 --> 09:20.433
They said we won't have fifth period today.

85
09:20.433 --> 09:21.273
All right!

86
09:21.273 --> 09:23.195
But they said we should stay home.

87
09:23.220 --> 09:23.603
Why?

88
09:23.603 --> 09:25.139
Another kidnapping.

89
09:25.166 --> 09:27.728
They say only children have been kidnapped.

90
09:27.781 --> 09:29.071
Hey, did you hear?

91
09:29.096 --> 09:29.844
Uh.

92
09:33.095 --> 09:37.496
Apparently there's no body inside the
coffin, it was in such bad shape.

93
09:38.320 --> 09:40.455
It definitely happened in Fuyuki, right?

94
09:49.885 --> 09:51.859
My name is Tohsaka and I'm in Kotone's class... 

95
09:51.884 --> 09:53.223
The person you are calling is not home.

96
09:53.223 --> 09:55.513
Please leave your message after the beep.

97
09:55.570 --> 09:56.450
Thank you.

98
10:12.838 --> 10:14.132
Please be safe.

99
10:16.458 --> 10:17.384
Kotone.

100
10:28.709 --> 10:30.919
This is Fuyuki at night.

101
10:36.425 --> 10:38.143
It's different than during the day.

102
10:38.440 --> 10:41.713
Ooh, it's really cold and creepy.

103
10:45.678 --> 10:46.944
What is this?

104
10:48.219 --> 10:49.799
I've never seen it do this.

105
10:51.219 --> 10:54.186
Does this mean there are traces
of magic all around here?

106
10:57.222 --> 10:58.914
I've got to find Kotone.

107
11:40.772 --> 11:41.672
Huh?

108
11:42.312 --> 11:44.438
Someone out with their kid this late?

109
11:47.213 --> 11:48.633
What was that flash?

110
12:14.422 --> 12:15.404
Oh, no.

111
12:25.852 --> 12:26.963
That was close.

112
12:27.236 --> 12:29.272
If I'm spotted, they'll take me home.

113
12:35.965 --> 12:38.558
Come on, you've got to walk, kid.

114
12:47.542 --> 12:48.555
Two of them?

115
12:53.802 --> 12:55.561
He's gathered more kids.

116
12:56.454 --> 12:57.448
But why?

117
12:59.351 --> 13:01.501
Wait, why am I hiding?

118
13:03.094 --> 13:05.566
I can't accomplish anything this way.

119
14:22.620 --> 14:24.813
Looks like no one's here.

120
14:40.233 --> 14:41.546
Hey, hey you?

121
14:43.292 --> 14:46.178
Kotone, Kotone, Kotone!

122
14:47.453 --> 14:49.437
Something's been done to her.

123
14:50.010 --> 14:50.910
What do I do?

124
14:51.355 --> 14:52.391
Think, Rin.

125
14:59.448 --> 15:02.287
Well now, are you lost little girl?

126
15:02.842 --> 15:05.314
No, um I...

127
15:05.692 --> 15:06.801
Perfect timing.

128
15:08.833 --> 15:11.286
We were just about to get the party started.

129
15:11.719 --> 15:14.256
But we still don't have enough guests.

130
15:15.386 --> 15:16.133
Want to help?

131
15:16.451 --> 15:17.621
It'll be fun.

132
15:23.262 --> 15:27.281
When it comes to parties,
the more the merrier I always say.

133
15:29.452 --> 15:30.288
No!

134
15:30.702 --> 15:33.210
What, what just happened?

135
15:33.781 --> 15:35.203
Don't run from me.

136
15:42.652 --> 15:44.776
Is he controlling them with that bracelet?

137
15:56.198 --> 15:57.146
Ow!

138
15:58.142 --> 15:59.007
I've got it.

139
16:07.822 --> 16:11.182
Well, well, you're gonna help me after all?

140
16:19.842 --> 16:20.481
Huh?

141
16:37.617 --> 16:38.903
What is that?

142
16:40.503 --> 16:42.705
You use too much mana all at once.

143
16:43.291 --> 16:45.335
I can destroy that!

144
16:48.581 --> 16:49.376
What?

145
16:57.296 --> 16:58.173
Kotone!

146
17:00.962 --> 17:01.560
Rin?

147
17:02.151 --> 17:03.479
What's going on?

148
17:06.491 --> 17:08.226
This is not the time to cry.

149
17:08.540 --> 17:09.226
Run!

150
17:10.852 --> 17:12.183
Hey, wait!

151
17:16.182 --> 17:17.240
Oh, man.

152
17:17.740 --> 17:20.006
I hope the big guy won't be too pissed.

153
17:26.742 --> 17:27.857
Where's Rin?

154
17:32.782 --> 17:34.082
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.

155
17:34.261 --> 17:35.801
Good, it's done.

156
17:37.412 --> 17:38.775
I did it, Father.

157
17:42.252 --> 17:42.930
What?

158
17:46.842 --> 17:47.677
Ah!

159
17:53.157 --> 17:57.730
Anything that provokes a reaction like that
is beyond your ability, so be very careful.

160
18:00.331 --> 18:00.846
Ah.

161
18:26.235 --> 18:29.411
Rin, I just can't believe she went to Fuyuki.

162
18:36.800 --> 18:37.640
Rin!

163
18:40.604 --> 18:41.224
Rin.

164
18:41.459 --> 18:42.661
Rin is fine.

165
18:43.398 --> 18:44.474
She's just asleep.

166
18:49.477 --> 18:50.866
Kariya.

167
18:52.171 --> 18:54.491
What's happening here?

168
18:54.777 --> 18:56.578
What are you doing here?

169
19:00.867 --> 19:02.018
Your face.

170
19:03.137 --> 19:05.797
Behold the family magic of the Matous.

171
19:06.123 --> 19:09.147
You offer your flesh and your life is slowly devoured.

172
19:09.997 --> 19:11.738
That is the magic's price.

173
19:13.403 --> 19:15.083
But Sakura will be fine.

174
19:15.717 --> 19:18.027
I'll save her before this happens to her.

175
19:19.041 --> 19:21.435
Zouken's only desire is the grail.

176
19:22.092 --> 19:25.502
He gave me his promise that he'll release Sakura

177
19:25.702 --> 19:27.168
as soon as I win it for him.

178
19:27.468 --> 19:29.517
If you win the grail?

179
19:29.739 --> 19:31.329
Yeah, so don't worry.

180
19:31.563 --> 19:33.371
My servant is the strongest.

181
19:33.598 --> 19:35.266
It won't lose to anyone.

182
19:35.885 --> 19:41.175
Considering what she's been through, hope would
be nothing but cruel torture to Sakura right now.

183
19:41.435 --> 19:44.359
So, pray for her since she can't.

184
19:44.932 --> 19:48.077
Pray for my victory, for Sakura's future.

185
19:51.247 --> 19:53.350
Kariya, wait.

186
19:55.595 --> 19:58.612
Someday I'm sure we'll all play in this park,

187
19:58.927 --> 20:01.561
just like we used to back in better days.

188
20:02.100 --> 20:04.471
And Rin and Sakura will be sisters again.

189
20:05.097 --> 20:09.347
So, Aoi, you don't need to cry anymore.

190
20:12.255 --> 20:17.737
Kariya, are you going to die and kill Tokiomi too?

191
20:22.518 --> 20:23.338
Mother?

192
20:24.131 --> 20:27.081
Rin, I was so worried about you.

193
20:28.143 --> 20:30.236
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

194
20:30.629 --> 20:31.724
I'm so sorry.

195
20:32.136 --> 20:33.624
I'm so sorry.

196
20:36.612 --> 20:42.786
Master Kirei, are you certain that you wish to allow
Tokiomi Tohsaka's wife and daughter to go free?

197
20:43.532 --> 20:44.552
It's fine.

198
20:44.969 --> 20:47.888
You are to continue
monitoring Berserker's master.

199
20:48.823 --> 20:49.823
Understood.

200
21:06.920 --> 21:10.457
It wasn't much, but I did manage to do something.

201
21:12.368 --> 21:14.741
I guess I'm not a full‐fledged mage yet.

202
21:15.034 --> 21:17.207
I passed out half way through.

203
21:18.551 --> 21:20.732
That means I need to work harder.

204
21:21.801 --> 21:23.607
But that's just for now.

205
21:24.776 --> 21:27.013
I have plenty of time to train more.

206
21:28.088 --> 21:31.745
And someday, I'll take my place as a Tohsaka mage.

207
21:32.191 --> 21:37.638
I'll have to practice really hard and obey my
father so that I'll be ready when that day comes.

208
21:38.956 --> 21:40.571
And when the time does come,
