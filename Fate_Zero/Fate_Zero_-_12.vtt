1
00:02.495 --> 00:04.395
What of Rider's Noble Phantasm?

2
00:05.397 --> 00:08.657
Equal to that of Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon.

3
00:08.920 --> 00:09.789
In other words,

4
00:09.920 --> 00:12.237
too powerful to be given a rank.

5
00:13.340 --> 00:14.115
Hmm.

6
00:14.405 --> 00:17.029
It all ended exactly as we planned.

7
00:18.430 --> 00:22.110
If we'd gone against Rider without
this new knowledge and unprepared,

8
00:22.603 --> 00:25.556
we would not have been able to
defend ourselves against him.

9
00:40.668 --> 00:42.968
This will begin the second stage.

10
00:43.408 --> 00:46.363
We will use the information Assassin gathered for us

11
00:46.803 --> 00:48.765
to have Archer defeat our enemies

12
00:49.111 --> 00:53.463
and in the process,
discover the means to defeat Rider.

13
00:54.210 --> 00:55.185
Yes.

14
00:55.689 --> 00:58.930
Thank you for your fine work as a Master.

15
02:31.059 --> 02:33.649
It is my belief that last night's attack

16
02:33.937 --> 02:36.312
involved all of the existing Assassins.

17
02:37.279 --> 02:38.094
Understood.

18
02:38.485 --> 02:39.571
By the way, Maiya,

19
02:39.853 --> 02:42.164
where are we with our new base of operations?

20
02:42.350 --> 02:43.157
Tomorrow morning.

21
02:43.592 --> 02:45.265
I will take Saber and madam there.

22
02:45.699 --> 02:46.699
Good, thank you.

23
02:46.757 --> 02:48.333
Of course, goodbye.

24
03:05.301 --> 03:07.834
No sign of movement at the Tohsaka residence.

25
03:08.422 --> 03:10.635
Since Assassin's attack on the very first day,

26
03:10.775 --> 03:12.600
Tokiomi hasn't left the building.

27
03:13.339 --> 03:15.052
An unsettling silence.

28
03:18.029 --> 03:20.222
Matou Master appears undefended,

29
03:20.649 --> 03:21.695
an easy target.

30
03:22.468 --> 03:22.968
But...

31
03:28.299 --> 03:30.605
Berserker's strange special ability

32
03:31.379 --> 03:33.434
suggests that he should be left alive

33
03:34.129 --> 03:36.113
to distract Archer and Tohsaka.

34
03:37.521 --> 03:40.329
Lord El‐Melloi should have been
removed from battle already.

35
03:40.799 --> 03:42.482
But Lancer still remains.

36
03:42.839 --> 03:45.306
We must discover his new Master's identity

37
03:45.763 --> 03:47.436
as soon as humanly possible.

38
03:48.407 --> 03:50.408
Caster's location remains unknown.

39
03:51.139 --> 03:54.120
But last night several children
vanished from this city again.

40
03:54.979 --> 03:59.524
They continue their atrocities
with no apparent plan whatsoever.

41
04:02.109 --> 04:04.724
Rider and his Master are constantly on the move.

42
04:05.369 --> 04:06.715
Tracking him is difficult.

43
04:07.369 --> 04:09.267
However large‐hearted he may seem,

44
04:09.409 --> 04:10.771
he is a dangerous foe.

45
04:11.306 --> 04:16.212
Furthermore, I'm quite concerned about
the Ionioin Hetairoi that Maiya reported.

46
04:18.907 --> 04:20.820
But more importantly...

47
04:21.566 --> 04:24.650
Is it safe to assume that Assassin
has been completely destroyed?

48
04:26.447 --> 04:28.849
In that case, his Master...

49
04:37.649 --> 04:41.827
If his plan was to work with Tohsaka,
using Assassin to spy on the others,

50
04:42.153 --> 04:44.966
then he should have never been
able to leave Fuyuki Church.

51
04:45.501 --> 04:47.101
But that isn't what happened.

52
04:47.665 --> 04:49.518
His ambush at the Fuyuki Hyatt,

53
04:49.798 --> 04:51.780
his attack in the Einzbern Forest,

54
04:52.372 --> 04:54.466
both actions defy explanation.

55
04:56.499 --> 05:00.002
Of course it all fits assuming he was after me.

56
05:00.399 --> 05:02.770
But why, why pursue me?

57
05:03.582 --> 05:09.075
Two days ago, he should have had no way of
knowing for certain that I am Saber's Master.

58
05:13.849 --> 05:16.662
Kirei Kotomine, who are you?

59
05:27.150 --> 05:31.077
You seem to be in rather fine sprits today, Archer.

60
05:31.617 --> 05:34.160
I still see little value to this Grail.

61
05:35.082 --> 05:37.328
But even if it is trash, that's fine.

62
05:38.161 --> 05:40.860
It seems I found another form of pleasure.

63
05:41.267 --> 05:45.817
Here in this world that you've constantly
mocked for being vile and full of imposters.

64
05:46.117 --> 05:47.774
That remains unchanged.

65
05:48.027 --> 05:52.808
However, I am now curious to see this
Holy Grail War through to its end.

66
05:53.941 --> 05:56.507
I am fond of lives full of hubris.

67
05:57.275 --> 06:00.787
Those who harbor grand ambitions
but are unequal to the task.

68
06:01.354 --> 06:04.531
The mere sight of such people
gives me great enjoyment.

69
06:05.306 --> 06:07.246
There are two kinds of arrogance,

70
06:07.652 --> 06:12.104
one where you are unequal to the task
and one where your dreams are too big.

71
06:13.033 --> 06:15.636
The former is just commonplace stupidity.

72
06:15.743 --> 06:19.529
But the latter is a rare
species, difficult to find.

73
06:20.006 --> 06:23.568
But they are identical in that
both kinds are fools, are they not?

74
06:25.669 --> 06:30.763
Isn't the foolishness of the few a more precious
commodity than the wisdom of the masses?

75
06:31.023 --> 06:32.852
There are those that are born human,

76
06:33.125 --> 06:35.872
but harbor wishes that man was not meant for

77
06:35.897 --> 06:38.537
and have renounced their humanity in its pursuit.

78
06:39.010 --> 06:41.152
I simply never grow weary

79
06:41.623 --> 06:44.001
of watching their grief and despair.

80
06:47.129 --> 06:49.724
Kirei, what of you today?

81
06:49.877 --> 06:52.316
For once, you seem almost strangely pleased.

82
06:52.811 --> 06:54.457
I'm simply relieved.

83
06:55.124 --> 06:59.505
I've finally been freed from a most unpleasant burden.

84
07:00.007 --> 07:03.037
What becomes of the Command Seals once they disappear?

85
07:03.649 --> 07:04.886
According to theory,

86
07:05.272 --> 07:07.796
Command Seals ultimately return to the Grail.

87
07:08.342 --> 07:13.409
And the Holy Grail repossesses the unused Command
Seals from any Master who has lost his Servant

88
07:13.770 --> 07:15.573
and has withdrawn from the war.

89
07:16.240 --> 07:20.236
Also, if for whatever reason a Servant loses its Master,

90
07:20.440 --> 07:23.740
the Grail will give those
seals to a newly chosen Master,

91
07:23.765 --> 07:26.726
assuming one can be found
before the war is over.

92
07:26.926 --> 07:30.353
The Command Seals stay a part
of this world until their use.

93
07:30.807 --> 07:35.472
At the end, any remaining seals are
given to the overseer for safe keeping.

94
07:36.007 --> 07:38.707
So, depending on what happens now,

95
07:38.973 --> 07:42.272
a new Master may yet appear and
enter the fight for the Grail.

96
07:42.485 --> 07:43.365
Possibly.

97
07:43.942 --> 07:48.353
But the Holy Grail does not deem many
on this Earth to be worthy of that role.

98
07:49.006 --> 07:51.718
Thus, when a replacement Master is sought,

99
07:52.165 --> 07:56.102
the Grail tends to select one of those
whom it had previously considered

100
07:56.418 --> 07:58.777
and deemed suitable for participation.

101
08:01.249 --> 08:03.683
What's the matter, continue with your talk.

102
08:04.039 --> 08:04.673
Go on.

103
08:06.177 --> 08:10.861
There is an unspoken reason that the Holy church
gives asylum and protection to those Masters

104
08:10.912 --> 08:12.252
who have left the war.

105
08:12.624 --> 08:15.889
In the event a place should open
among the remaining Masters,

106
08:16.186 --> 08:21.515
there's a high probability that any unpaired
Masters will receive the Command Seals left behind.

107
08:22.248 --> 08:25.561
This is why Grail War Masters try to kill

108
08:25.947 --> 08:30.120
rather than injure or temporarily
incapacitate enemy Masters.

109
08:31.621 --> 08:33.358
Well, then from that perspective,

110
08:33.840 --> 08:37.569
is there not a good chance that the
Command Seals will be given to you again?

111
08:38.151 --> 08:39.241
Impossible.

112
08:39.510 --> 08:43.778
If as Tokiomi has always suggested,
the Holy Grail only chose me

113
08:44.131 --> 08:46.522
as a support mage to the Tohsaka team.

114
08:47.237 --> 08:49.822
I have fulfilled that duty and am finished.

115
08:50.282 --> 08:55.981
Tokiomi already possesses a winning strategy for
dealing with the remaining Masters and their Servants.

116
08:57.357 --> 08:59.577
There is simply nothing more for me to do.

117
09:00.039 --> 09:01.286
If I may opine,

118
09:01.539 --> 09:04.561
Tokiomi's hypotheses have been dubious from the start.

119
09:05.205 --> 09:09.899
He has never struck me as a man truly fit to be
backed by the power and prestige of the Grail.

120
09:10.181 --> 09:15.449
I must say, I am surprised that you have such
harsh words to offer regarding your own Master.

121
09:15.731 --> 09:21.371
Kirei, you seem to be mistaken as to who
serves whom in my relationship with Tokiomi.

122
09:22.222 --> 09:24.590
He is treated civilly as my vassal.

123
09:25.037 --> 09:27.574
And he supplies me with mana as an offering.

124
09:28.298 --> 09:32.515
I answered his summons precisely because
those were the terms of our pact.

125
09:33.389 --> 09:36.412
I'm curious, what do you make of the Command Seals then?

126
09:36.546 --> 09:41.605
I hate them, but if a vassal is
trying to become a better vassal,

127
09:42.172 --> 09:45.824
I don't mind listening to a differing
opinion or two from time to time.

128
09:46.386 --> 09:52.437
By the way, Kirei, you mentioned earlier that Assassin
had fulfilled all his missions before he was destroyed.

129
09:52.891 --> 09:54.552
What of the matter we discussed?

130
09:54.846 --> 09:58.967
You mean your interest in learning the
motives of each Master for desiring the Grail?

131
09:59.580 --> 10:01.989
Yes, they completed that investigation.

132
10:02.326 --> 10:05.853
I should have had an Assassin present
the report to you in person last night.

133
10:06.380 --> 10:08.329
That would have saved me the trouble of having to... 

134
10:08.384 --> 10:10.083
No, this is better.

135
10:10.743 --> 10:13.916
I'm not interested in what
that walking shade has to say.

136
10:14.531 --> 10:19.538
Kirei, this report is meaningless to me
unless it comes directly from your lips.

137
10:21.469 --> 10:22.155
Hmm.

138
10:30.423 --> 10:32.357
How does it feel to drive a car, Saber?

139
10:32.597 --> 10:33.372
Do you like it?

140
10:33.513 --> 10:35.737
Yes, I think this is a splendid vehicle.

141
10:36.004 --> 10:39.677
I can not help but wonder what would have
happened had these existed back in my time.

142
10:40.558 --> 10:44.618
Irisviel, are you certain it is all
right with you that I drive this vehicle?

143
10:44.735 --> 10:48.834
You seemed to thoroughly enjoy the act of
driving when we were out the other night.

144
10:49.313 --> 10:50.369
No, this is fine.

145
10:50.595 --> 10:53.624
If you're happy driving the
car then I'm happy, too.

146
10:53.863 --> 10:57.653
I have to say, the skills of a
Servant are absolutely amazing.

147
10:57.994 --> 11:00.283
This is your first time touching this machine,

148
11:00.491 --> 11:02.255
yet you're driving it perfectly.

149
11:02.635 --> 11:05.873
Oh, thank you, but I'm finding
the sensation somewhat odd.

150
11:05.993 --> 11:11.133
It's like I'm employing skills I was taught a long
time ago that were buried deep within my memory.

151
11:11.283 --> 11:16.164
Rather than understanding it intellectually,
my body instinctively knows what to do next.

152
11:19.631 --> 11:22.223
Still, do you really think this is a wise idea?

153
11:22.420 --> 11:25.152
The estate that is to be our new base of operations

154
11:25.298 --> 11:27.853
lies precisely in the heart of the main battlefield.

155
11:28.160 --> 11:29.628
Don't you worry about that.

156
11:30.015 --> 11:33.072
Because secrecy is the hallmark of the Grail War,

157
11:33.534 --> 11:37.257
the Tohsakas and Matous have openly
established fortifications in the city.

158
11:37.917 --> 11:42.182
The Einzberns are unusual for building
that castle in such a distant location.

159
11:42.496 --> 11:46.432
On the contrary, this new base that Kiritsugu
has secured might be more advantageous

160
11:46.503 --> 11:51.155
than the castle we'd been using because
its location is unknown to the others.

161
12:02.116 --> 12:05.653
It's another very unusual building.

162
12:06.382 --> 12:09.839
From now on, this place will be your base of operations.

163
12:09.959 --> 12:12.774
Ah, if you can take those for me, Saber.

164
12:12.943 --> 12:15.125
Yes, of course I can, Irisviel.

165
12:20.783 --> 12:23.445
Maiya, what does this key open?

166
12:24.108 --> 12:26.300
It appears quite different from the others.

167
12:26.440 --> 12:28.340
It's for the storehouse in the yard.

168
12:28.893 --> 12:32.414
It's fairly old, but I've
confirmed that is is solidly built.

169
12:32.821 --> 12:35.253
There was really no time for preparations,

170
12:35.393 --> 12:38.647
so this may be somewhat lacking as a proper residence.

171
12:38.963 --> 12:44.135
That's fine... for now so long as it keeps
us out of the rain, that's sufficient.

172
12:50.643 --> 12:55.254
Now then, come on, Saber,
let's go and explore our new place.

173
12:55.507 --> 12:56.949
Yes, let's.

174
12:59.682 --> 13:02.743
I think this is like one of
this country's haunted houses.

175
13:03.103 --> 13:07.615
I'm sure all the hallways have wooden
floors and the room's floors are woven grass

176
13:08.055 --> 13:10.223
with nice partitions made of paper.

177
13:12.256 --> 13:15.108
I told him once I wanted to see a Japanese mansion.

178
13:15.468 --> 13:18.103
Maybe Kiritsugu remembered I said that.

179
13:29.057 --> 13:32.080
Is our new base of operations not what you expected?

180
13:33.206 --> 13:38.765
No, it's not that, I like it well enough,
but this isn't really an ideal base for a mage.

181
13:39.012 --> 13:41.680
There are a few things that could be better.

182
13:42.402 --> 13:46.152
The magical barriers are well laid
out, but for a workshop it's... 

183
13:46.539 --> 13:50.577
well, when it's this open to the outside,
the magic has lots of ways to leak out.

184
13:51.304 --> 13:55.510
I would have preferred a more secure
room walled off with stone or clay.

185
14:01.774 --> 14:04.911
Ah, this is ideal!

186
14:09.102 --> 14:10.569
It's a bit small,

187
14:11.149 --> 14:15.361
but I'm sure I can craft my spells in here
just as well as I did back at the castle.

188
14:16.070 --> 14:16.903
Perfect.

189
14:17.010 --> 14:21.133
Inscribing the magic circle here should
be good enough to make it my own.

190
14:22.067 --> 14:24.573
All right then, let's get started, shall we?

191
14:24.947 --> 14:26.371
There's a lot of work to do.

192
14:26.691 --> 14:27.911
Will you help me, Saber?

193
14:28.358 --> 14:31.583
We'll draw a magic circle right
there, six feet in diameter.

194
14:31.774 --> 14:32.333
Right.

195
14:32.667 --> 14:35.815
I'll need your help most once
we start to craft the mercury.

196
14:36.115 --> 14:38.779
And don't worry,
I'll tell you exactly how to do it.

197
14:39.512 --> 14:40.872
Will you do me a favor?

198
14:41.371 --> 14:44.168
Could you bring in the ingredients
we left out in the trunk?

199
14:45.123 --> 14:48.354
Irisviel, I must ask you something.

200
14:48.620 --> 14:53.508
It seems all day today, you've acted as if
you've been carefully avoiding touching anything.

201
14:54.365 --> 14:55.952
Have I been imagining this?

202
14:56.695 --> 14:59.212
Driving the car, holding the keys.

203
14:59.799 --> 15:02.790
Those matters by themselves would
not have caused me to worry,

204
15:03.476 --> 15:07.884
but now it is beginning to appear as if you're
not even going to handle your own magic.

205
15:09.997 --> 15:11.774
If you were not feeling well today,

206
15:12.422 --> 15:14.436
it is important that you tell me about it.

207
15:15.037 --> 15:19.385
It is my duty to ensure your
safety whenever it is necessary.

208
15:20.085 --> 15:22.449
So I must know if anything is wrong.

209
15:24.579 --> 15:27.310
You're absolutely right, I'm sorry.

210
15:27.876 --> 15:30.344
I couldn't keep this hidden
for very long anyway.

211
15:33.822 --> 15:34.662
Your hand?

212
15:39.449 --> 15:45.830
Saber, I'm going to squeeze your hand as hard
as I can using all the strength I can, okay?

213
15:47.281 --> 15:48.728
All right, go ahead.

214
15:54.493 --> 15:55.616
Irisviel?

215
15:56.466 --> 15:58.333
Are you sure you are not pretending.

216
15:58.800 --> 16:01.986
I know it's weak, but this is all I can do right now.

217
16:02.994 --> 16:05.804
Just touching your fingers is the most I can manage.

218
16:06.284 --> 16:09.428
Grasping something or
picking it up is beyond me.

219
16:10.363 --> 16:12.536
Dressing this morning was so difficult.

220
16:15.539 --> 16:17.990
But, but what is the matter with you?

221
16:18.463 --> 16:19.569
Have you been injured?

222
16:20.049 --> 16:22.195
No, I'm just not feeling too well.

223
16:22.289 --> 16:24.337
So I've disabled my sense of touch.

224
16:24.864 --> 16:28.927
Just shutting down one of my senses
allows me to control my power quite a bit

225
16:29.314 --> 16:32.619
and it means that I can continue
to do everything else I must.

226
16:33.312 --> 16:37.026
Being able to do things like this
is the specialty of a homunculus.

227
16:38.108 --> 16:40.945
But Irisviel, that simply can not be all there is to it.

228
16:41.419 --> 16:44.538
What exactly is wrong with you?
Should you not go see a doctor?

229
16:45.171 --> 16:46.466
What if it's serious?

230
16:47.501 --> 16:52.300
Perhaps you may have forgotten, Saber,
but I am not in any way a normal human being.

231
16:52.566 --> 16:57.210
If I happen to catch a cold,
I can't even go to the clinic like everyone else does.

232
16:57.922 --> 17:02.901
I suppose you could say my condition stems
from an inherent flaw in my creation.

233
17:03.375 --> 17:04.332
Don't worry about it.

234
17:04.982 --> 17:09.955
Of course what this means is I'm going to
need for you to do a few things for me.

235
17:10.947 --> 17:14.163
From now on, I'll need you to
drive the car like you did today.

236
17:14.822 --> 17:17.963
And you'll have to help me set up
and perform my magical rituals.

237
17:19.263 --> 17:22.302
I'm sorry, but I'll be depending on you,

238
17:22.615 --> 17:24.012
my brave and gallant knight.

239
17:24.912 --> 17:25.858
Yes, I'll help.

240
17:26.418 --> 17:29.889
I apologize for prying into the
details of your private life.

241
17:30.561 --> 17:31.346
Forgive me.

242
17:31.579 --> 17:32.814
It's really okay.

243
17:33.274 --> 17:36.993
Now, why don't we get started on
that circle before it gets too late.

244
17:37.220 --> 17:40.630
If I rest in a magic circle that's
connected to local lay lines,

245
17:40.840 --> 17:42.240
my condition will improve.

246
17:42.467 --> 17:44.366
At least it should start to a little bit.

247
17:44.841 --> 17:45.646
Understood.

248
17:45.879 --> 17:48.014
Then I shall retrieve the materials right away.

249
17:53.733 --> 17:58.123
With regards to Lancer's Master and Ryder's
Master, they appear to have no wish in particular

250
17:58.182 --> 18:01.717
that they plan to ask for should
they happen to win the Holy Grail.

251
18:02.279 --> 18:06.162
They simply seek victory as a
means to win glory as mages.

252
18:06.645 --> 18:09.122
Now then, as for Caster's Master,

253
18:09.232 --> 18:12.341
he seems to have no real
understanding as to what the Grail is.

254
18:12.655 --> 18:18.129
He is only taking part in the Holy Grail War
as an extension of his interest in killing for fun.

255
18:19.017 --> 18:24.901
Regarding Berserker's Master, he is immature and
seeks a measure of absolution above all else.

256
18:25.670 --> 18:28.936
For a time, he had severed all
ties with the Matou family,

257
18:29.285 --> 18:33.897
yet he is now demanding that the family set free
the younger Tohsaka daughter whom they adopted.

258
18:34.121 --> 18:38.218
She is currently being groomed to be the
next head of the Matou family in his place.

259
18:38.738 --> 18:44.250
He has been given the assignment of winning the Holy
Grail to secure his end of a bargain for her release.

260
18:45.563 --> 18:49.839
In addition, he appears to have a
past relationship with Tohsaka's wife.

261
18:51.298 --> 18:55.133
In a sense, it might be said that between
all of the five competing Masters,

262
18:55.175 --> 18:58.448
he has the most unrefined and
banal motives of them all.

263
19:01.080 --> 19:02.060
What is it?

264
19:02.573 --> 19:03.813
Continue, Kirei.

265
19:04.441 --> 19:06.374
It's Saber's Master.

266
19:13.153 --> 19:13.945
Hmm.

267
19:14.934 --> 19:17.214
He is merely a hired mercenary

268
19:17.467 --> 19:21.906
retained by the Einzberns to achieve their
long‐held dream of attaining the Grail.

269
19:22.032 --> 19:24.996
I was a fool to expect more from him, hmm.

270
19:25.396 --> 19:27.188
What an utter disappointment.

271
19:27.668 --> 19:30.990
It seems he turned out to be just another mongrel.

272
19:31.505 --> 19:35.486
With dull and stupid reasons for
seeking out and stealing my treasure.

273
19:35.766 --> 19:37.676
Exactly like all the rest of them.

274
19:39.073 --> 19:44.046
You cause me to go to all that trouble
investigating and that is all you have to say?

275
19:44.206 --> 19:46.853
Think of those whose effort has been wasted on you.

276
19:47.041 --> 19:48.082
Wasted effort?

277
19:48.693 --> 19:50.103
What wasted effort?

278
19:50.473 --> 19:52.508
The work put in by you and Assassin

279
19:52.781 --> 19:54.498
has paid off rather handsomely.

280
19:55.493 --> 19:57.724
Are you mocking me, King of Heroes?

281
19:58.224 --> 19:59.194
Is that it?

282
19:59.721 --> 20:00.861
You don't understand.

283
20:01.354 --> 20:02.678
That's to be expected.

284
20:03.228 --> 20:07.132
You are an obtuse man who can
not even recognize his own joy.

285
20:07.539 --> 20:13.166
Regardless of its self awareness of this fact,
a soul instinctively seeks out joy in its life.

286
20:13.768 --> 20:17.723
This expression of the soul appears in
the form of interest or appreciation.

287
20:18.481 --> 20:24.339
Thus, Kirei, having you tell me what you've seen and
heard was of great interest and importance to me.

288
20:24.885 --> 20:27.149
And was very instructive, indeed.

289
20:27.843 --> 20:30.217
What you spoke about at the greatest length

290
20:30.724 --> 20:33.434
was what actually interested you the most.

291
20:35.171 --> 20:39.693
For now, let us just set aside the man
you've deliberately avoided speaking about.

292
20:40.323 --> 20:43.462
A conscious interest is no more than a simple obsession.

293
20:44.288 --> 20:48.222
That being the case,
of the remaining four Masters in the war,

294
20:48.288 --> 20:51.539
of which one did you
speak about most passionately?

295
20:52.704 --> 20:54.682
Berserker's Master.

296
20:55.122 --> 20:56.451
Kariya, was it?

297
20:57.741 --> 21:02.786
Kirei, when you told me about him you
spoke of his motivations in great detail.

298
21:04.970 --> 21:07.209
His circumstances are complicated.

299
21:07.429 --> 21:10.679
Thus they required the most detailed
explanation out of all of them.

300
21:10.959 --> 21:12.263
Hmm, you are wrong.

301
21:12.336 --> 21:17.303
He was the only one you ordered Assassin to
investigate to a thorough enough degree such that

302
21:17.328 --> 21:19.679
you can understand
those circumstances.

303
21:19.866 --> 21:22.967
And this was due to your unconscious interest in him.

304
21:25.391 --> 21:27.761
I accept that I made an error in judgment.

305
21:28.228 --> 21:32.043
It's true that in the long term,
Kariya Matou poses no threat.

306
21:32.364 --> 21:33.908
He was not worth the attention.

307
21:34.368 --> 21:40.591
My overestimation of his abilities has invited
your unnecessary speculations about me.

308
21:40.851 --> 21:42.537
Is that so?

309
21:42.664 --> 21:45.893
Then imagine for me a scenario
in which chance and fortune

310
21:46.014 --> 21:51.419
ensure that Berserker and his Master survive the
many battles and lasted until the end of the war.

311
21:51.852 --> 21:53.881
Can you imagine what would happen then?

312
21:54.361 --> 21:55.400
What do you think?

313
22:04.273 --> 22:05.841
Listen, Kirei.

314
22:06.616 --> 22:09.348
Is it not time that you finally understood

315
22:09.746 --> 22:12.479
the actual question that I am asking you?

316
22:16.391 --> 22:23.383
Tell me, Archer, what could possibly be the
point in imagining Kariya Matou's victory?

317
22:23.743 --> 22:24.723
No point.

318
22:25.123 --> 22:26.707
There is no point at all.

319
22:27.844 --> 22:30.790
Come now, don't be so angry with me.

320
22:31.030 --> 22:32.372
Think about it for a moment.

321
22:32.692 --> 22:37.902
The fact that Kirei Kotomine never recognized
the futility in such a speculation.

322
22:38.672 --> 22:42.273
Do you not agree there is a
clear, unshakable meaning here?

323
22:45.059 --> 22:47.238
Explain for me, Archer.

324
22:47.858 --> 22:48.717
It is like this.

325
22:48.742 --> 22:52.844
If you had been given the same question
but regarding the other Masters,

326
22:53.251 --> 22:58.296
you would have perceived that there is no point to
it and you would have rejected it as a waste of time.

327
22:59.181 --> 23:02.472
However, that was not how it went with Kariya.

328
23:02.978 --> 23:08.137
For him, you abandoned your usual sharp wits
and wasted your time in pointless thought.

329
23:08.912 --> 23:10.412
You ignored the futility

330
23:10.892 --> 23:15.588
and the waste of effort,
you found enjoyment in the exercise.

331
23:16.015 --> 23:21.753
Celebrate, Kirei, you have finally
understood what pleasure is at long last.

332
23:22.333 --> 23:25.065
Pleasure, are you talking about joy?

333
23:25.465 --> 23:26.467
Indeed.

334
23:28.484 --> 23:33.571
There is nothing in Kariya Matou's
fate that could bring a man any joy.

335
23:34.051 --> 23:38.316
His tortured life is nothing but an
endless string of suffering and tragedy.

336
23:38.828 --> 23:43.528
For him, a quick and unexpected
death would actually be a blessing.

337
23:44.128 --> 23:47.646
Kirei, why must you define joy so narrowly?

338
23:48.274 --> 23:52.835
Where is the paradox in finding suffering
and tragedy simply other forms of joy?

339
23:53.428 --> 23:55.676
There is no one fixed type of joy.

340
23:56.169 --> 23:58.986
You are confused because
you fail to understand that.

341
23:59.209 --> 24:01.406
This is something that can not be allowed!

342
24:02.016 --> 24:06.630
King of Heroes,
a sick and human monster such as yourself

343
24:06.937 --> 24:10.185
may find joy in some small
amount of another's pain.

344
24:10.551 --> 24:15.341
But that is the soul of a Godless sinner!
An evil that must be punished!

345
24:15.634 --> 24:20.138
Thus, I have sworn to follow the
path of pure faith in my life.

346
24:20.971 --> 24:24.168
And so you have defined joy itself as a sin.

347
24:24.753 --> 24:27.918
It's astonishing to see how far you've twisted it.

348
24:28.138 --> 24:30.593
You never cease to be a source of fascination.

349
24:30.875 --> 24:31.793
Delightful.

350
24:35.269 --> 24:37.571
This pain.

351
24:38.224 --> 24:40.548
Aarrgh.

352
24:41.527 --> 24:44.878
Ah, exactly as I expected.

353
24:45.668 --> 24:48.292
I must admit that did not take very long at all.

354
24:49.045 --> 24:50.133
Impossible.

355
24:50.600 --> 24:53.675
This can't be, no Servant has
been freed from their pact.

356
24:54.208 --> 24:57.063
Why has the Holy Grail chosen a new Master?

357
24:57.289 --> 24:59.118
It appears that the Holy Grail

358
24:59.428 --> 25:03.150
still expects much more from Kirei Kotomine in this war.

359
25:03.656 --> 25:07.231
Kirei, you should go and heed the Grail's summons.

360
25:08.094 --> 25:12.858
Without a doubt, you have some hidden
reason to seek this mystical wish granter.

361
25:13.168 --> 25:15.708
I have a reason to seek the Grail?

362
25:16.294 --> 25:19.605
If this wish granting device is truly omnipotent,

363
25:19.925 --> 25:25.270
then it can give shape and substance to the wish
that lies within the darkest depths of your heart.

364
25:25.750 --> 25:28.982
A wish of which even you remain unaware.

365
25:30.010 --> 25:33.401
So you claim that since I do not know my desire,

366
25:33.887 --> 25:37.901
I should use the wish granting device
as a means to learn what it is?

367
25:38.636 --> 25:39.967
That can only happen

368
25:40.267 --> 25:45.255
if I enter the war as an independent mage
and systematically crush six other wishes.

369
25:45.482 --> 25:49.145
If I selfishly seek possession
of the Grail for my own desires,

370
25:49.358 --> 25:55.138
that means that I will have ruthlessly
betrayed my own teacher and mentor.

371
25:55.698 --> 25:59.284
Then you will need to have a strong
Servant on your side to fight for you.

372
25:59.577 --> 26:01.813
If you would seek to do battle against me.

373
26:02.268 --> 26:06.184
Of course before any of that,
you must steal a new Servant for yourself.

374
26:06.564 --> 26:10.408
One already summoned and controlled
by one of the other Masters.

375
26:10.868 --> 26:16.315
In that case...  no, I won't say it.

376
26:17.032 --> 26:19.953
Everything from this point forward is up to you.

377
26:21.193 --> 26:23.703
Do it all exactly as you desire.

378
26:24.283 --> 26:26.728
That is the true meaning of pleasure.

379
26:27.014 --> 26:29.578
Pleasure leads to the experience of joy.

380
26:30.193 --> 26:32.668
And joy will lead you to happiness.

381
26:33.448 --> 26:35.900
Your path is now clear, Kirei.

382
26:36.533 --> 26:40.425
So clear there is no longer any need to hesitate.
