00:08.247 --> 00:09.240
Hey! Come on, Kerry!

2
00:09.364 --> 00:10.824
Hurry! Hurry up!

3
00:10.882 --> 00:12.194
Kerry, jump in! Come on!

4
00:12.194 --> 00:13.610
Come on! Come on!

5
00:13.737 --> 00:15.033
It's so nice! Hurry up!

6
00:38.037 --> 00:39.951
That was sweet, Kerry!

7
00:39.976 --> 00:41.957
That was so cool! You're so awesome.

8
00:41.957 --> 00:43.207
That was nothing. You're so cool.

9
00:43.207 --> 00:43.873
That was really great.

10
00:45.360 --> 00:46.366
Shirley!

11
00:46.391 --> 00:47.592
Shirley!

12
00:47.892 --> 00:48.852
Kerry!

13
00:49.298 --> 00:50.338
Sorry I'm late.

14
00:55.422 --> 00:56.620
Hey, Kerry,

15
00:56.807 --> 00:59.800
do you know where this island's name comes from?

16
00:59.893 --> 01:00.528
Uh‐uh.

17
01:01.120 --> 01:03.683
Oh, isn't Arimago the word for crab?

18
01:04.080 --> 01:04.657
Yep.

19
01:05.447 --> 01:09.119
Long ago, this was a place where they
would make offerings to the sea gods.

20
01:10.420 --> 01:15.260
But then one day a girl who was very poor and
had absolutely nothing to feed her sick mother

21
01:15.555 --> 01:18.976
took some of the food that had been
set out by the village as an offering.

22
01:20.023 --> 01:25.035
The sea gods were so upset by this that they
cursed the girl and transformed her into a crab.

23
01:25.184 --> 01:26.559
That's where it comes from?

24
01:26.825 --> 01:28.214
What an awful story.

25
01:28.734 --> 01:32.400
Well, according to the legend,
the shrine where the village worshipped those gods

26
01:32.457 --> 01:36.427
was located way up in the mountains,
right about the place where your house is.

27
01:37.917 --> 01:41.345
That's why none of the villagers in
this area ever want to go up there.

28
01:41.792 --> 01:43.225
They say it's bad luck.

29
01:43.880 --> 01:46.119
They tell me that if I go there too often,

30
01:46.619 --> 01:48.090
I'll end up cursed for life.

31
01:48.420 --> 01:49.323
You're kidding.

32
01:49.800 --> 01:50.516
Really?

33
01:50.924 --> 01:52.650
But everyone's nice to me.

34
01:53.470 --> 01:54.800
Of course they are.

35
01:55.112 --> 01:56.996
You're not an outsider to them anymore.

36
01:58.178 --> 02:00.961
In the village, they just treat
you like you're my little brother.

37
02:03.687 --> 02:05.069
Your little brother, huh?

38
02:06.486 --> 02:09.295
You know, Kerry, you've really settled in nicely here.

39
02:09.472 --> 02:10.232
Yeah?

40
02:10.952 --> 02:16.248
Back when you first arrived, everyone used to
really bully you, saying you had a weird name.

41
02:16.660 --> 02:17.348
Hey!

42
02:18.894 --> 02:21.464
You were the very first one to call my name weird,

43
02:22.091 --> 02:24.559
and it was your big idea to call me Kerry.

44
02:25.392 --> 02:29.293
Well, yeah, because your actual
name is really hard to say.

45
02:29.750 --> 02:31.031
Kerry, uh...

46
02:31.259 --> 02:32.372
Kerry...

47
02:32.512 --> 02:33.474
Kiritsugu.

48
02:33.670 --> 02:34.470
Jeez.

49
02:34.600 --> 02:35.524
Kerrystugu!

50
02:36.178 --> 02:37.359
Not even close.

51
02:37.680 --> 02:38.559
Really?

52
02:39.970 --> 02:40.794
Oops.

53
02:52.837 --> 02:53.797
Okay.

54
02:54.403 --> 02:54.977
Hm?

55
02:56.432 --> 02:58.358
Hey, Dad, is that a new one?

56
02:59.137 --> 02:59.877
That's right.

57
03:00.144 --> 03:03.110
This would make my 100th success.

58
03:06.995 --> 03:07.870
Amazing.

59
03:08.035 --> 03:09.508
These flowers don't wither.

60
03:10.443 --> 03:12.720
That's because I've altered the flow of time.

61
03:13.460 --> 03:17.132
They will never grow beyond
this, but they will never die.

62
03:17.412 --> 03:18.692
Unbelievable.

63
03:19.432 --> 03:23.739
The big question is whether or not we can
get the same theory to work on humans.

64
03:28.933 --> 03:30.253
Sorry for the wait!

65
03:30.799 --> 03:32.872
Shirley, what you got?

66
03:33.776 --> 03:34.723
Check it out.

67
03:35.182 --> 03:36.796
It's my first successful flower.

68
03:37.171 --> 03:40.668
Shirley has been watching closely
and learning while she assists me.

69
03:44.231 --> 03:47.048
She does seem to have the natural gift to be a mage.

70
03:47.422 --> 03:49.245
Aw, come on now, Professor.

71
03:49.285 --> 03:50.558
You did most of the work.

72
03:50.771 --> 03:53.402
I only did a little bit, and it was right at the end.

73
03:53.728 --> 03:55.463
Maybe, but it's amazing.

74
03:56.056 --> 03:57.510
Uh, hey, Dad?

75
03:57.789 --> 03:58.760
Huh, what?

76
03:59.253 --> 04:01.422
You think I could give it a try?

77
04:01.735 --> 04:03.137
What Shirley did, I mean.

78
04:03.543 --> 04:04.634
That'd be great!

79
04:04.954 --> 04:06.636
I think if you had a little bit of help,

80
04:06.962 --> 04:07.755
you could do it.

81
04:08.522 --> 04:09.642
Right, Professor?

82
04:09.667 --> 04:10.052
No.

83
04:11.327 --> 04:14.502
Kiritsugu, it's still too early for you.

84
04:14.755 --> 04:15.282
Mm.

85
04:16.097 --> 04:17.430
This isn't a game.

86
04:17.777 --> 04:18.976
There are dangers.

87
04:19.529 --> 04:24.595
I only let Shirley try it because she has the
necessary knowledge and experience to succeed.

88
04:24.700 --> 04:25.394
Hm.

89
04:40.293 --> 04:43.328
Father Simon, why won't you try to understand?

90
04:43.399 --> 04:44.286
Shirley.

91
04:44.606 --> 04:47.130
Everyone in town has the professor all wrong!

92
04:47.714 --> 04:49.632
Shirley, listen to me.

93
04:49.964 --> 04:52.295
You must stop going up to that mansion.

94
04:56.194 --> 04:57.812
Let's talk inside.

95
05:03.024 --> 05:06.387
I think Dad should spend some
time with the villagers too.

96
05:09.694 --> 05:10.683
I don't know.

97
05:11.512 --> 05:15.433
Father Simon just has it in for him for some reason.

98
05:16.332 --> 05:18.343
He keeps lecturing me all the time.

99
05:18.744 --> 05:20.818
He says if I stay working there,

100
05:21.118 --> 05:23.559
I'll get possessed by a demon someday.

101
05:23.997 --> 05:24.919
Check this out.

102
05:25.461 --> 05:26.961
He gave this to me yesterday.

103
05:27.314 --> 05:30.117
Says I should always keep it near me.

104
05:30.501 --> 05:33.048
He told me that it's a powerful talisman.

105
05:35.012 --> 05:38.919
So you're not scared, you know, of my dad?

106
05:39.099 --> 05:40.092
Not at all.

107
05:40.292 --> 05:44.520
I realize that magical research
like he does isn't exactly normal.

108
05:44.913 --> 05:48.263
But the professor's research
and discoveries are a big deal.

109
05:48.577 --> 05:50.534
I mean, they could make history.

110
05:51.722 --> 05:53.948
Actually, I think he's amazing.

111
05:59.837 --> 06:01.297
Are you sure you should be...

112
06:02.366 --> 06:04.903
What; It's sharp and it's really easy to use.

113
06:07.634 --> 06:09.015
Well, see you tomorrow.

114
06:11.174 --> 06:13.180
Shirley, something wrong?

115
06:15.095 --> 06:17.668
Keeping a flower blooming forever.

116
06:18.054 --> 06:19.917
It's really amazing magic.

117
06:20.434 --> 06:22.374
But you're doing it too, Shirley.

118
06:22.764 --> 06:25.024
The work with flowers is all I can do.

119
06:26.209 --> 06:28.089
But he can do a lot more than that.

120
06:28.764 --> 06:32.859
The medicines he makes could make
human beings effectively immortal.

121
06:33.592 --> 06:37.051
I really want him to use his power
for the good of the whole world

122
06:37.386 --> 06:41.126
so that everyone will finally
understand how incredible he is.

123
06:41.849 --> 06:43.442
He's given up on that.

124
06:44.704 --> 06:48.004
But, Kerry, I think you can do it.

125
06:48.624 --> 06:49.719
Oh, come on.

126
06:50.078 --> 06:52.271
You're the best student he's ever had.

127
06:53.079 --> 06:55.048
If anyone could carry on his work,

128
06:55.514 --> 06:56.396
it'd be you.

129
06:57.136 --> 06:59.129
Kerry, I'm not really his student.

130
06:59.829 --> 07:01.497
At best, I'm his assistant.

131
07:02.184 --> 07:03.408
Running his errands,

132
07:03.644 --> 07:04.569
helping out.

133
07:08.904 --> 07:10.957
See, I'm not his student.

134
07:11.024 --> 07:11.863
Far from it.

135
07:12.636 --> 07:16.597
So even when Father Simon says bad things about
him, there's nothing I can say.

136
07:17.586 --> 07:21.644
Kerry, you're his heir, there's no doubt about it.

137
07:22.494 --> 07:27.756
You do realize that everything he's working
on now he plans for you to continue.

138
07:28.924 --> 07:31.988
It's just a little too soon, that's all.

139
07:34.384 --> 07:36.269
Hey, come with me.

140
07:53.996 --> 07:54.755
Whoa.

141
08:00.709 --> 08:01.752
Tell me, Kerry,

142
08:02.926 --> 08:04.672
what do you want to grow up to be?

143
08:05.636 --> 08:06.029
Huh?

144
08:06.596 --> 08:08.564
If you decide to take up your dad's work,

145
08:08.977 --> 08:10.690
what do you think you'll use it for?

146
08:12.491 --> 08:14.451
It's a world changing power,

147
08:15.088 --> 08:17.088
and one day it will be yours.

148
08:18.470 --> 08:20.327
So, go change the world.

149
08:21.114 --> 08:22.217
You can do it.

150
08:22.774 --> 08:23.924
I guarantee it.

151
08:25.486 --> 08:26.625
Well, I, uh...

152
08:28.196 --> 08:29.269
That's a secret.

153
08:31.686 --> 08:32.499
Hm.

154
08:35.734 --> 08:41.430
Then I guess I'll have to wait until you grow
up to see what you're gonna do with your power.

155
08:42.872 --> 08:47.653
I'll stay with you until that day comes, okay?

156
08:54.702 --> 08:56.302
Yeah, right, whatever.

157
09:02.904 --> 09:03.581
Stop it!

158
09:03.691 --> 09:04.408
No way!

159
09:13.774 --> 09:15.460
Oh, good morning, Dad.

160
09:16.140 --> 09:20.906
Kiritsugu, you didn't go into
my workshop last night, did you?

161
09:21.266 --> 09:21.712
Huh?

162
09:22.045 --> 09:23.300
No, I didn't.

163
09:24.134 --> 09:24.926
I see.

164
09:27.821 --> 09:30.489
Listen, don't leave the house.

165
09:30.877 --> 09:31.417
Huh?

166
09:31.500 --> 09:32.207
Stay here.

167
09:32.307 --> 09:33.947
Don't go into the village today.

168
09:36.696 --> 09:38.482
What's gotten into him?

169
09:44.001 --> 09:46.360
Shirley's late, I wonder why.

170
09:58.740 --> 09:59.354
Hey!

171
10:00.840 --> 10:02.284
Have you guys seen Shirley?

172
10:02.487 --> 10:03.504
Uh‐uh.

173
10:11.497 --> 10:12.367
Shirley?

174
10:21.547 --> 10:22.518
Shirley?

175
10:25.767 --> 10:26.399
Hm.

176
10:33.307 --> 10:33.706
Huh?

177
10:45.617 --> 10:46.631
What the?

178
10:46.931 --> 10:47.978
What happened?

179
11:11.977 --> 11:13.003
Kerry.

180
11:14.357 --> 11:15.304
Shirley!

181
11:21.397 --> 11:21.965
I...

182
11:22.971 --> 11:26.462
I only wanted to prove him right.

183
11:26.762 --> 11:29.543
His resear... research.

184
11:31.229 --> 11:34.331
But I guess

185
11:34.746 --> 11:36.619
it didn't work.

186
11:47.120 --> 11:47.860
Kill me.

187
11:50.517 --> 11:51.430
Use that.

188
11:52.097 --> 11:52.858
Please.

189
11:53.953 --> 11:55.433
You have to kill me.

190
11:57.699 --> 11:58.850
Do it now

191
11:59.237 --> 12:01.809
before it's too late.

192
12:03.915 --> 12:05.101
Please do it!

193
12:06.181 --> 12:07.516
I can't stop.

194
12:08.829 --> 12:11.202
Can't hold it back anymore.

195
12:11.375 --> 12:12.644
Hurry!

196
12:24.841 --> 12:25.501
Hm.

197
12:26.840 --> 12:29.306
Are you certain it was Shirley who did this?

198
12:36.936 --> 12:39.681
Kerry, I want you to stay here for the time being.

199
12:40.190 --> 12:41.882
I'll go inform the village.

200
12:53.830 --> 12:54.438
Agh!

201
13:53.839 --> 13:54.609
Agh!

202
13:55.623 --> 13:56.429
Agh!

203
14:10.256 --> 14:10.847
What?

204
14:11.313 --> 14:13.533
What is all this?

205
14:31.776 --> 14:33.885
Father Simon?

206
15:01.266 --> 15:02.236
Yah!

207
15:24.247 --> 15:24.794
Agh!

208
15:25.110 --> 15:25.900
Agh!

209
15:31.570 --> 15:34.329
Looks like we got here just a little too late.

210
15:34.843 --> 15:35.682
Wait a minute.

211
15:36.450 --> 15:38.066
Who are... who are you?

212
15:38.910 --> 15:39.527
Agh!

213
15:41.156 --> 15:41.782
Agh!

214
15:43.806 --> 15:46.603
Don't you think you should worry about yourself first?

215
15:48.250 --> 15:52.299
Well, if you just sit there like that,
you'll be joining them soon enough.

216
16:01.060 --> 16:02.856
So what's going on?

217
16:03.430 --> 16:04.516
Who did all this?

218
16:05.270 --> 16:06.797
Why would they burn the village?

219
16:07.480 --> 16:09.667
Surely you must have heard of them before.

220
16:10.070 --> 16:12.267
You would know them as vampires.

221
16:12.780 --> 16:15.368
The name we use is Dead Apostles.

222
16:15.990 --> 16:16.843
Apostles?

223
16:17.240 --> 16:19.652
They drink blood to increase their numbers.

224
16:20.080 --> 16:23.383
Nearly everyone living on this
island has become one now,

225
16:24.323 --> 16:26.974
and here we are having to clean up the mess.

226
16:27.582 --> 16:31.990
So, we have two groups down there
right now trying to eliminate them all.

227
16:32.865 --> 16:35.547
One of the groups is made up of Church Inquisitors,

228
16:35.747 --> 16:38.077
those who believe beyond the shadow of a doubt

229
16:38.123 --> 16:41.221
that it's all right to slaughter
anyone who defies the will of God.

230
16:41.725 --> 16:44.807
They'll show no mercy to any Dead Apostles they find,

231
16:45.115 --> 16:48.818
and they'll kill anyone they even
suspect of having had their blood sucked.

232
16:49.498 --> 16:51.844
The other group is from the Mage's Association,

233
16:52.124 --> 16:53.708
and they're harder to explain.

234
16:54.320 --> 16:58.946
Suffice it to say, they'd very much like to
keep the secret of who made such bizarre things

235
16:58.973 --> 17:01.301
as the Dead Apostles to themselves.

236
17:02.487 --> 17:05.604
Naturally, since their motto is All To Ourselves,

237
17:05.904 --> 17:08.772
they'll kill anyone they suspect of knowing the secret.

238
17:09.090 --> 17:10.792
They'll do anything to cover this up.

239
17:11.354 --> 17:13.957
It was the mages who set a torch to the village.

240
17:15.359 --> 17:17.894
So then whose side are you on?

241
17:18.822 --> 17:22.233
I'm something akin to a salesman
to the Mage's Association.

242
17:23.100 --> 17:25.296
All right, it's your turn, kid.

243
17:25.689 --> 17:27.487
Time to answer one of my questions.

244
17:28.462 --> 17:30.714
I'm looking for a mage who's marked for sealing.

245
17:31.810 --> 17:32.805
What's a mage?

246
17:33.791 --> 17:36.679
I suppose that word doesn't really mean anything to you.

247
17:37.479 --> 17:40.314
There was someone who became a Dead Apostle first,

248
17:40.645 --> 17:44.411
someone infected them with the medium
that turns people into those creatures,

249
17:44.957 --> 17:47.470
the trigger that started their transformation.

250
17:48.092 --> 17:50.749
The son of a bitch mage who conjured that medium up

251
17:51.142 --> 17:53.772
should be laying low somewhere on this island.

252
17:54.307 --> 17:57.216
Can you think of any likely spots where I should look?

253
18:13.843 --> 18:14.397
Oh, good.

254
18:14.477 --> 18:15.340
There you are.

255
18:15.400 --> 18:16.345
You're okay.

256
18:16.820 --> 18:17.972
Well, thank goodness.

257
18:18.793 --> 18:21.073
Didn't I tell you not to go into the village?

258
18:22.961 --> 18:26.320
Dad, why were you researching Dead Apostles?

259
18:26.814 --> 18:28.257
How did you know about that?

260
18:29.899 --> 18:33.383
Shirley used the magic on herself.

261
18:35.535 --> 18:38.981
Oh, well, that's most unfortunate.

262
18:39.421 --> 18:41.552
But you can't change what's already happened.

263
18:41.989 --> 18:44.872
It just means Shirley gave me
an answer I was looking for,

264
18:44.930 --> 18:45.692
that's all.

265
18:47.789 --> 18:50.531
Dad, will... will you use me

266
18:50.724 --> 18:51.822
like you used Shirley?

267
18:51.988 --> 18:53.175
Don't be stupid.

268
18:53.861 --> 18:56.269
A Dead Apostle that can't control its blood lust

269
18:56.502 --> 18:57.320
is a failure.

270
18:58.000 --> 19:02.385
But the Emiya family research
requires an unlimited amount of time.

271
19:02.696 --> 19:06.216
The Root will never be attained
by someone with a mortal body.

272
19:06.843 --> 19:08.887
It was a time consuming task,

273
19:09.290 --> 19:11.497
but it seems to have ended in failure.

274
19:12.281 --> 19:14.943
I'm going to have to reconsider my entire theory.

275
19:15.731 --> 19:18.775
Kiritsugu, let's save this matter for another time.

276
19:19.088 --> 19:21.465
For now, escaping comes first.

277
19:22.729 --> 19:24.653
It's not too late to escape?

278
19:24.993 --> 19:27.403
I suspected something like this might happen one day,

279
19:27.650 --> 19:30.314
so I've kept a motorboat hidden on the south coast.

280
19:33.564 --> 19:34.924
I'm sorry, Kiritsugu,

281
19:35.482 --> 19:37.689
but we don't have time to let you gather your things.

282
19:38.480 --> 19:38.995
Come on.

283
19:39.508 --> 19:40.495
I'm gonna do it.

284
19:41.310 --> 19:43.397
There's a Bounded Field around the forest,

285
19:43.576 --> 19:45.365
an extremely powerful one.

286
19:45.865 --> 19:48.051
It'll take a little bit of time to break through it,

287
19:48.538 --> 19:51.175
but I'll be able to get in.

288
19:51.950 --> 19:53.478
I have to be the one.

289
20:16.299 --> 20:17.435
Tell me, Kerry...

290
20:21.860 --> 20:23.469
What do you want to grow up to be?

291
20:50.676 --> 20:54.636
That Bounded Field,
I was able to break through it easily.

292
20:56.323 --> 20:58.717
Are you mad or stupid?

293
20:59.520 --> 21:02.218
It was only dumb luck that you showed up in time.

294
21:02.595 --> 21:04.137
If this man had escaped,

295
21:04.240 --> 21:07.534
he'd have continued his Dead
Apostles research somewhere else.

296
21:08.504 --> 21:12.641
Yeah, well, that's a pretty crappy
reason for a kid to kill his father.

297
21:15.287 --> 21:17.478
You're a good person, aren't you?

298
21:19.287 --> 21:21.545
I'll get you off this godforsaken island.

299
21:22.069 --> 21:23.975
You can decide the rest for yourself.

300
21:24.957 --> 21:26.170
Wanna take anything?

301
21:28.246 --> 21:29.194
Nothing at all.
