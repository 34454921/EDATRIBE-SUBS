1
00:21.411 --> 00:22.458
Rider?

2
00:25.518 --> 00:26.601
What the hell?

3
00:26.808 --> 00:29.663
What do you think you're doing
breaking the shutter open like that?

4
00:29.816 --> 00:32.453
Why didn't you go through in
spirit form like when you entered?

5
00:33.113 --> 00:37.141
I cannot carry these things
while I am in my spirit form.

6
00:38.035 --> 00:39.769
And don't whine so much.

7
00:40.028 --> 00:42.779
You sound like you're some kind
of common thief or street urchin.

8
00:42.819 --> 00:45.785
Well, if you aren't a thief, then what the hell are you?

9
00:46.605 --> 00:48.285
Something entirely different.

10
00:48.708 --> 00:52.052
A cowardly thief sneaks away in the night full of fear.

11
00:52.443 --> 00:55.765
If you stride away bursting with song proudly,

12
00:55.842 --> 00:58.115
then what you are is a conquering king!

13
00:58.848 --> 01:01.308
Just what I needed...  now get out of here!

14
01:01.308 --> 01:03.553
Get lost... get lost now!

15
01:03.799 --> 01:06.598
Very well... then I shall leave you to carry the spoils.

16
01:06.598 --> 01:08.239
Try not to drop them.

17
01:11.688 --> 01:15.271
Oh, man, why is this happening to me?

18
02:53.100 --> 02:54.633
I... I don't get it.

19
02:54.839 --> 02:58.364
The summoning worked,
so why do I have to do all of this?

20
02:59.074 --> 03:01.792
What's so important about these books, anyway?

21
03:02.431 --> 03:05.249
It's important because we are preparing for war.

22
03:05.748 --> 03:09.259
And one cannot wage war without having proper maps.

23
03:10.444 --> 03:13.184
Hey, boy, where are Macedonia and Persia?

24
03:13.464 --> 03:15.706
You can't talk to me like that!

25
03:15.964 --> 03:17.703
I'm your master... 

26
03:21.344 --> 03:25.122
I am well aware of my status as
servant and yours as my master.

27
03:25.279 --> 03:27.952
After all, we forged a pact, did we not?

28
03:28.764 --> 03:29.534
Mhm.

29
03:30.104 --> 03:34.984
But I'm interested in learning where
all my old territories are located.

30
03:38.614 --> 03:39.989
I think they're here.

31
03:40.376 --> 03:41.276
Hmm.

32
03:46.454 --> 03:49.766
I spent my life conquering that
land, and look how puny it is!

33
03:49.834 --> 03:50.686
Very well.

34
03:51.124 --> 03:52.981
I can't wait to get started!

35
03:53.369 --> 03:54.515
All right, then.

36
03:55.060 --> 03:58.300
Where exactly on this map are we sitting right now, boy?

37
03:59.579 --> 04:00.499
Here.

38
04:01.304 --> 04:03.554
So, the other side of the round land.

39
04:04.054 --> 04:04.534
Hmm.

40
04:05.134 --> 04:06.396
Good news indeed.

41
04:06.804 --> 04:09.332
This will guide us well in the coming battles.

42
04:09.934 --> 04:11.067
Guide us well?

43
04:11.144 --> 04:13.287
First, to the other side of the world,

44
04:13.535 --> 04:16.122
due west, and we go as fast as we can.

45
04:16.524 --> 04:19.219
And we shall conquer every land that we pass through!

46
04:19.814 --> 04:22.187
I shall return to Macedonia in triumph,

47
04:22.404 --> 04:26.021
and my people will hold a festival
in honor of my great revival!

48
04:27.324 --> 04:29.429
Now how splendid will that be?

49
04:30.374 --> 04:32.172
Why do you think you're here, anyway?

50
04:32.197 --> 04:34.743
You didn't forget the Grail War, did you?

51
04:34.818 --> 04:36.984
Hmm, that's right.

52
04:37.214 --> 04:38.334
Speaking of the Grail,

53
04:38.334 --> 04:40.545
I have neglected to ask one small thing.

54
04:40.844 --> 04:43.642
What will you do with the Grail once you possess it?

55
04:43.924 --> 04:46.373
Why... what's it to you what I do?

56
04:46.581 --> 04:48.421
I mean, what do you care?

57
04:48.736 --> 04:51.650
If you are also intent on world conquest,

58
04:51.739 --> 04:53.737
then that would make you my enemy,

59
04:54.604 --> 04:57.261
because the world cannot serve two lords.

60
04:57.463 --> 04:58.102
Wha... 

61
04:58.680 --> 05:00.357
No, I don't want that!

62
05:01.064 --> 05:04.182
Look, I'll tell you what I really want, okay?

63
05:05.364 --> 05:07.929
I just want people to treat me fairly.

64
05:08.364 --> 05:13.234
I wanna make all those idiots back at the clock
tower who never even bothered to give me a chance

65
05:13.259 --> 05:14.834
to admit to me that they were wrong!

66
05:14.834 --> 05:15.914
Small!

67
05:18.030 --> 05:18.991
Small.

68
05:19.559 --> 05:21.448
And narrow‐minded and stupid!

69
05:21.714 --> 05:26.214
You mean to tell me that in this battle,
your only concern is for your ridiculous reputation?

70
05:26.260 --> 05:28.560
And you dare call yourself my master?

71
05:28.680 --> 05:30.950
What a terrible disappointment you are.

72
05:33.054 --> 05:37.201
If you wish so desperately for
others to fear and respect you...

73
05:38.693 --> 05:41.476
...perhaps you should try using the Holy Grail's power

74
05:41.653 --> 05:44.713
to grow another 30 centimeters
and add a little bit of muscle.

75
05:50.324 --> 05:52.294
He's supposed to be my servant!

76
05:52.414 --> 05:54.274
He can't talk to me that way!

77
05:54.936 --> 05:56.282
I'll show him!

78
05:57.754 --> 05:59.541
I address the command seal.

79
06:00.451 --> 06:02.398
In accordance with the Grail's laws,

80
06:02.478 --> 06:05.664
I order this man, Iskander the Conqueror...

81
06:08.973 --> 06:10.513
Calm down, Waver.

82
06:10.594 --> 06:15.284
A master can only use his command seal to
compel his servant's obedience three times

83
06:15.354 --> 06:16.370
and that's all.

84
06:16.543 --> 06:21.031
If I use all my command seals,
I won't be able to control him when I really need to.

85
06:26.045 --> 06:29.055
As long as I get the Holy Grail, it doesn't matter.

86
06:29.488 --> 06:31.921
I really don't give a damn what you do after that, so... 

87
06:31.993 --> 06:33.188
Enough, boy!

88
06:33.364 --> 06:35.902
I shall acquire the Grail for you as you wish.

89
06:36.624 --> 06:39.454
Yeah, well, you seem awfully confident about that.

90
06:39.503 --> 06:41.583
Do you have any idea how you're gonna do it?

91
06:42.544 --> 06:46.461
So you wish to see my power...  is
that what you're trying to tell me?

92
06:47.246 --> 06:49.041
Well, of course I do!

93
06:49.132 --> 06:52.832
You need to prove to me that I can rely
on you no matter what the situation!

94
06:56.684 --> 07:02.394
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors!
With the swing of my sword, I declare my supremacy!

95
07:38.159 --> 07:41.297
This is the ox chariot that King
Gordius once offered up to Zeus.

96
07:41.536 --> 07:46.929
Its renowned reputation must be the source
of my designation as a rider class servant.

97
07:47.740 --> 07:50.973
If you want the Grail,
then find me another hero or two... 

98
07:51.364 --> 07:53.099
someone worthy for me to fight!

99
07:53.614 --> 07:58.217
Until then, I shall entertain myself by
sitting here and looking at these maps.

100
07:58.534 --> 08:00.856
That will not pose a problem, will it?

101
08:06.900 --> 08:07.892
All right!

102
08:08.000 --> 08:10.164
I'm not gonna lose today... you just watch!

103
08:17.290 --> 08:19.002
Ah, I found one.

104
08:19.580 --> 08:21.500
No way...  where is it?

105
08:21.597 --> 08:24.664
Oh, gee, I'm sure I didn't overlook it!

106
08:25.710 --> 08:28.439
That's the very first chestnut bud today!

107
08:30.010 --> 08:31.405
First point to me.

108
08:32.550 --> 08:34.527
I'm not gonna lose!

109
08:38.890 --> 08:40.434
Oh, there's one!

110
08:40.600 --> 08:41.651
Right here!

111
08:41.825 --> 08:42.927
Ahhh.

112
08:43.360 --> 08:45.766
You see...  I found one too!

113
08:46.280 --> 08:48.003
I found my second over here.

114
08:48.385 --> 08:49.283
Huh?

115
08:50.740 --> 08:53.795
Hey, that isn't a chestnut branch.

116
08:53.910 --> 08:55.328
It's kind of, Ilya.

117
08:55.539 --> 08:58.012
That branch is actually from a tree called a wingnut.

118
08:58.200 --> 08:59.858
It's almost like a chestnut,

119
09:00.018 --> 09:02.759
so as far as I'm concerned, it's a chestnut bud.

120
09:04.210 --> 09:06.565
‐Huh? ‐That's no fair!

121
09:06.651 --> 09:08.622
No fair, no fair, no fair!

122
09:08.880 --> 09:11.890
The whole time we've been
playing, you've been cheating!

123
09:11.996 --> 09:16.235
Yes, but your daddy can't win
this game against you otherwise!

124
09:16.521 --> 09:20.854
If you keep on cheating like you've been doing,
I won't play this game with you ever again!

125
09:21.350 --> 09:22.484
I don't want that!

126
09:22.600 --> 09:24.912
I'm sorry, Ilya, I apologize.

127
09:25.270 --> 09:27.876
Do you promise not to cheat like that anymore?

128
09:28.690 --> 09:29.709
Yes, I do.

129
09:29.990 --> 09:31.122
Okay then.

130
09:31.200 --> 09:33.336
I challenge you to one more round.

131
09:33.570 --> 09:36.360
A true champion accepts all challengers!

132
09:36.507 --> 09:40.256
Indeed, I'm very honored, your highness.

133
09:41.330 --> 09:43.838
Wow, I'm so high up!

134
09:47.920 --> 09:50.819
What's got your attention out there, Saber?

135
09:52.130 --> 09:53.454
It's interesting.

136
09:53.510 --> 09:56.443
Your daughter and Kiritsugu are playing outside.

137
10:00.185 --> 10:01.505
Are you surprised?

138
10:02.060 --> 10:06.619
I was under the impression that my master
had a colder heart than he's showing now.

139
10:06.940 --> 10:10.032
Well, I can see why you might think that.

140
10:13.360 --> 10:16.239
If that really is Kiritsugu's true self,

141
10:16.874 --> 10:21.328
then I am afraid I must've gravely
offended him when we first met.

142
10:22.870 --> 10:26.045
Irisviel, you really don't have to laugh at me.

143
10:26.250 --> 10:27.713
I'm sorry.

144
10:28.130 --> 10:31.743
I was wondering if you're still concerned
with our reaction when you were summoned?

145
10:32.670 --> 10:33.994
Yes, somewhat.

146
10:34.340 --> 10:37.597
True, I did pretend to be a man during my original life.

147
10:37.720 --> 10:41.441
But surely there was no need for you two
to be so shocked when you saw me.

148
10:42.060 --> 10:45.755
I'm so sorry, but we just couldn't help it!

149
10:46.172 --> 10:49.740
Your legend... I mean, King Arthur's legend

150
10:50.070 --> 10:51.762
is extremely famous.

151
10:52.440 --> 10:54.030
Well, if that's the case,

152
10:54.650 --> 10:57.174
do you think he might underestimate my ability

153
10:57.410 --> 10:58.989
simply because I am a woman?

154
10:59.160 --> 11:00.393
No, never.

155
11:00.620 --> 11:01.648
Not at all.

156
11:02.080 --> 11:05.863
Then again, if he's upset as you think he is,

157
11:06.210 --> 11:08.046
I'm certain that there's another reason.

158
11:08.080 --> 11:09.154
Such as?

159
11:09.545 --> 11:14.180
He's probably upset at all the people
who were around you at the time.

160
11:14.445 --> 11:19.498
The selfish ones,
the ones cruel enough and uncaring enough

161
11:19.724 --> 11:22.942
to force the role of King upon an innocent little girl.

162
11:23.123 --> 11:25.203
It was inevitable that would happen.

163
11:25.350 --> 11:27.238
I had resigned myself to that fate

164
11:27.324 --> 11:29.764
when I drew forth the sword from the stone.

165
11:30.739 --> 11:34.454
I believe that that upsets him even more than anything else,

166
11:34.594 --> 11:36.474
your resignation to your fate.

167
11:38.110 --> 11:40.223
Well, then he forgets his place.

168
11:40.620 --> 11:44.724
He hasn't the right to question
decisions made by those of my time,

169
11:44.904 --> 11:47.492
including those decisions I made myself.

170
11:47.670 --> 11:50.549
That's why he says nothing about it to you.

171
11:51.920 --> 11:53.897
I'm afraid that Kiritsugu Emiya,

172
11:54.061 --> 11:57.754
and the hero Arturia will never
get along with each other.

173
11:58.430 --> 12:00.929
He must've resigned himself to that fact.

174
12:09.150 --> 12:12.488
He wants to use the Holy
Grail's power to save the world.

175
12:12.770 --> 12:15.831
That is his ambition and yours, correct?

176
12:16.490 --> 12:21.134
Yes, but you must understand that
I get my beliefs directly from him.

177
12:21.656 --> 12:24.637
My own desire for the Grail is exactly the same.

178
12:26.700 --> 12:31.509
It is my fervent wish to save Britain
since I could not protect it in life.

179
12:32.750 --> 12:38.404
I think what you and Kiritsugu seek is right and
just, something to be proud of.

180
12:45.680 --> 12:50.061
Our next match won't happen until you come back
from your trip to Japan, will it?

181
12:50.350 --> 12:51.354
That's right.

182
12:52.060 --> 12:55.891
How long do you think your work
will keep you and Mommy away from home?

183
12:56.030 --> 12:57.490
When will you come back?

184
12:58.190 --> 13:01.106
I should be back here in two weeks or so.

185
13:01.360 --> 13:04.615
Your mom won't be back for quite a while, though.

186
13:05.435 --> 13:07.949
Yeah, Mommy told me about that already.

187
13:08.105 --> 13:10.811
She said we'd be apart for a long time.

188
13:12.105 --> 13:16.050
She also told me that even if we don't
see each other for a long, long time,

189
13:16.050 --> 13:18.210
she'll always be right here by my side,

190
13:18.341 --> 13:20.105
so I shouldn't ever feel lonely.

191
13:20.143 --> 13:22.378
She told me that before I went to sleep.

192
13:22.640 --> 13:24.404
I'm gonna be together with Mommy,

193
13:24.550 --> 13:27.090
well, forever and ever and ever!

194
13:28.520 --> 13:29.385
I see.

195
13:37.690 --> 13:39.326
Listen, Ilya.

196
13:42.990 --> 13:43.903
Daddy?

197
13:45.830 --> 13:47.528
Can you wait for me, Ilya?

198
13:48.120 --> 13:52.216
Even if you're lonely, can you last till I come home?

199
13:52.960 --> 13:53.671
Mhm!

200
13:55.730 --> 13:59.465
Good, then I promise you I'll be home

201
14:00.260 --> 14:01.673
before you know it.

202
14:07.322 --> 14:09.853
Fill, fill.

203
14:10.072 --> 14:13.290
Fill her up, fill.

204
14:13.532 --> 14:16.111
Repeat four times.

205
14:16.622 --> 14:17.897
Or was it five times?

206
14:18.082 --> 14:22.145
Um, and then I have to destroy it each time it's filled.

207
14:22.412 --> 14:23.827
Wait, is that right?

208
14:25.752 --> 14:30.214
All right, now,
fill and fill and fill and fill and fill.

209
14:30.433 --> 14:32.115
Okay, that's five times.

210
14:32.262 --> 14:33.446
Right!

211
14:35.389 --> 14:38.998
At all three murder scenes,
officials tell us a mysterious pentagram

212
14:39.058 --> 14:42.657
was found drawn in the victim's blood.
Police speculate... 

213
14:42.723 --> 14:46.150
Do you think that maybe I
went a little bit too far?

214
14:56.976 --> 15:00.765
Hey, do you believe in terrible demons, kiddo?

215
15:01.550 --> 15:06.428
All the newspapers and magazines right now
are saying I'm some kind of terrible demon.

216
15:06.752 --> 15:10.216
But suppose demons like that
really did exist in the world.

217
15:10.462 --> 15:12.875
I mean, wouldn't that be awfully rude to them?

218
15:12.962 --> 15:15.432
You've gotta be pretty clear about these things.

219
15:15.552 --> 15:18.837
Yo, I am Ryunosuke Uryu, and I am a demon!

220
15:18.972 --> 15:22.039
Ah‐ha, I don't know if that's
the right way to go about it.

221
15:22.972 --> 15:25.345
But look, I found this little baby!

222
15:25.442 --> 15:28.657
It's some dusty old book from
deep inside our big storehouse.

223
15:28.862 --> 15:34.386
Looks like some of my ancestors were doing a bunch
of research on how to go about summoning demons!

224
15:34.492 --> 15:37.923
So, like, I've just gotta find
out if there really are demons!

225
15:38.072 --> 15:39.045
Understand?

226
15:39.242 --> 15:41.840
But you know, if a demon really did appear,

227
15:41.992 --> 15:44.963
it would be pretty stupid of me
to just chat with it for a while

228
15:44.988 --> 15:47.962
and then just send it back to
whatever pit of Hell it came from.

229
15:48.672 --> 15:52.505
So, kid, if a demon does show up around here,

230
15:53.420 --> 15:55.780
would you mind letting it kill ya?

231
16:01.722 --> 16:04.313
I wonder what it's like being killed by a demon!

232
16:04.472 --> 16:06.288
How many people get to find out?

233
16:08.522 --> 16:11.036
Wait a minute, what's that?

234
16:35.712 --> 16:39.327
I'll ask you, you who calls to me,

235
16:39.882 --> 16:44.317
oh, summoner who manifests me
within the vessel of a caster,

236
16:44.892 --> 16:46.976
I ask you your name.

237
16:47.352 --> 16:48.149
Who?

238
16:49.142 --> 16:51.004
Who art thou?

239
16:54.072 --> 16:59.072
Um, uh, well, I'm Ryunosuke Uryu,
and I'm currently working odd jobs.

240
16:59.199 --> 17:01.005
My hobby is murder of all varieties.

241
17:01.162 --> 17:03.633
I really like kids and sometimes young women.

242
17:03.832 --> 17:07.412
Very well, the pact is now officially sealed.

243
17:07.647 --> 17:12.430
It's my irresistible desire to possess
the Holy Grail exactly as you do.

244
17:12.597 --> 17:17.920
The sacred vessel of paradise,
the cup of awesome and terrible power will be ours!

245
17:18.027 --> 17:20.033
The Holy... what?

246
17:20.762 --> 17:24.511
Anyway, how would you like a little
snack just to kick things off right?

247
17:24.831 --> 17:26.972
Here, wanna eat this kid?

248
17:35.272 --> 17:37.744
Wow, that's human skin, isn't it?

249
18:09.535 --> 18:11.668
Don't be frightened, little boy.

250
18:11.732 --> 18:13.115
You'll be fine.

251
18:22.532 --> 18:24.321
Can you stand?

252
18:26.122 --> 18:27.773
All right, now, little boy.

253
18:27.952 --> 18:30.895
You can leave the room through
that door right over there.

254
18:31.002 --> 18:32.832
You think you can manage that?

255
18:39.422 --> 18:41.252
Hey, what are you doing?

256
18:41.712 --> 18:43.014
Shh.

257
19:12.872 --> 19:15.951
Terror has its degrees of freshness.

258
19:16.024 --> 19:17.768
The more intense the fear,

259
19:17.832 --> 19:20.838
the more all of the other emotions die.

260
19:21.172 --> 19:26.694
Terror, in its truest sense,
is not a static state, but rather a dynamic one.

261
19:26.762 --> 19:31.684
It is the sublime moment when
shining hope turns to utter despair.

262
19:32.602 --> 19:34.506
Did you enjoy that?

263
19:34.732 --> 19:38.804
The tantalizing flavor of fresh terror and bloody death?

264
19:41.362 --> 19:42.923
Cool!

265
19:43.032 --> 19:44.377
You are awesome!

266
19:44.464 --> 19:46.337
You are the coolest thing ever!

267
19:46.517 --> 19:52.082
Okay, look, I don't know anything about this Grail
crap, but from this moment on, I am with you.

268
19:52.174 --> 19:53.280
Let's go kill!

269
19:53.480 --> 19:57.756
I want you to take me out and show me
even cooler ways to torture and kill!

270
19:58.311 --> 20:00.706
Ah... the name is Ryunosuke, correct?

271
20:00.922 --> 20:06.118
What a magnificent omen to be blessed with
such an understanding master like yourself.

272
20:06.247 --> 20:10.197
I feel my darkest dream is nearly within my grasp.

273
20:10.602 --> 20:13.065
Oh, hey, I didn't get your name.

274
20:13.262 --> 20:14.234
What is it?

275
20:14.720 --> 20:16.275
You wish to know my name.

276
20:16.395 --> 20:22.116
Let me see now, in this era,
the most common name for me would be, uh...

277
20:23.890 --> 20:28.702
perhaps for now I'll just call myself Bluebeard.

278
20:33.282 --> 20:35.334
The church contacted me.

279
20:35.502 --> 20:39.920
They said that the seventh servant,
a caster has finally appeared.

280
20:40.122 --> 20:42.942
The final servant has been summoned?

281
20:43.212 --> 20:44.475
Then it's time.

282
20:44.922 --> 20:45.988
Indeed.

283
20:46.462 --> 20:50.756
You are to leave here now,
and head immediately to Tohsaka Manor.

284
20:51.802 --> 20:53.704
And once I arrive?

285
20:54.222 --> 20:58.205
The Manor is surrounded by a number
of powerful magical barriers,

286
20:58.352 --> 21:00.913
but they should be child's play for you.

287
21:03.112 --> 21:04.640
Are you sure about this?

288
21:04.694 --> 21:09.079
I was under the impression that you
were allies with Tokiomi Tohsaka.

289
21:09.282 --> 21:11.085
Don't you worry about that.

290
21:11.565 --> 21:16.495
Even if it means you have to engage Archer in
battle, there's no need to fear.

291
21:16.912 --> 21:22.832
No need to fear Archer, one of the three
great Knight classes of the Grail Wars?

292
21:25.712 --> 21:27.355
I leave the rest to you.

293
21:27.762 --> 21:31.732
Eliminate Tokiomi Tohsaka at once.

294
22:32.362 --> 22:34.426
This will be easy.

295
22:40.452 --> 22:46.240
You are nothing but a slimy worm.
Who gave you permission to look up at me?

296
22:48.842 --> 22:53.787
No need...to fear that, he says?

297
23:04.642 --> 23:07.094
You are not worthy to gaze upon me.

298
23:07.637 --> 23:13.450
A filthy worm like you should face the
ground, crawl on your stomach, and die.
