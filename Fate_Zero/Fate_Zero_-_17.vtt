1
02:10.481 --> 02:11.307
Murdered?

2
02:13.947 --> 02:16.150
I can't...believe it.

3
02:16.844 --> 02:18.620
Why would anyone kill him?

4
02:18.953 --> 02:20.093
It's unthinkable!

5
02:21.109 --> 02:22.619
This cannot be allowed!

6
02:28.437 --> 02:30.761
It must also be regrettable for you

7
02:31.054 --> 02:32.907
to lose your father in this way.

8
02:33.127 --> 02:33.927
It is.

9
02:34.171 --> 02:36.662
Father Risei was very dear.

10
02:36.959 --> 02:39.295
He was just like a second father to me.

11
02:40.024 --> 02:43.288
It's been one unexpected
disaster after another.

12
02:43.668 --> 02:48.229
I think it might prove necessary
to formulate a new plan right away.

13
02:58.366 --> 03:00.269
Why did you not tell Tokiomi?

14
03:02.849 --> 03:04.089
Tell him what?

15
03:04.609 --> 03:06.117
I pity your father.

16
03:06.684 --> 03:10.227
He died believing his son
to be a pious man of God.

17
03:11.100 --> 03:11.814
Or...

18
03:12.857 --> 03:14.906
perhaps that was his salvation.

19
03:16.641 --> 03:19.589
Does your father's death arouse no feeling in you?

20
03:21.235 --> 03:22.921
He was killed, after all.

21
03:23.368 --> 03:26.445
You could at least attempt to appear a little upset.

22
03:27.009 --> 03:27.744
I am.

23
03:28.049 --> 03:30.081
I'm furious to no end.

24
03:30.641 --> 03:32.170
Furious, you say?

25
03:33.729 --> 03:34.599
Are you...

26
03:34.937 --> 03:37.857
furious because you were unable to kill him yourself?

27
03:47.439 --> 03:48.274
Saber?

28
03:50.069 --> 03:52.792
Irisviel, how are you feeling?

29
03:54.496 --> 03:56.978
It appears I've made you worry about me again.

30
03:57.486 --> 03:58.420
I'm sorry.

31
03:58.928 --> 03:59.581
No.

32
03:59.955 --> 04:01.621
As long as you are truly fine.

33
04:02.247 --> 04:04.011
That is all that really matters to me.

34
04:04.865 --> 04:05.640
But then...

35
04:10.535 --> 04:11.482
It's okay.

36
04:11.942 --> 04:13.895
It's Maiya's presence you are sensing.

37
04:14.799 --> 04:15.857
Tohsaka?

38
04:16.385 --> 04:17.078
Yes.

39
04:17.425 --> 04:19.838
He requests that we present a united front.

40
04:20.198 --> 04:21.624
Wait, an alliance?

41
04:21.857 --> 04:22.831
At this stage?

42
04:23.248 --> 04:25.563
The thought of dealing with Rider and Berserker

43
04:26.077 --> 04:28.235
must have Tohsaka feeling father uneasy.

44
04:29.339 --> 04:32.212
And so, assuming that we would be the most amenable,

45
04:32.452 --> 04:33.829
he has invited us to meet.

46
04:34.949 --> 04:38.048
Meaning that he considers us the
weakest of the remaining teams.

47
04:38.198 --> 04:42.787
Tohsaka said that he wishes to meet with
you tonight over at the Fuyuki church.

48
04:43.227 --> 04:47.839
You should know that from the very start
Tokiomi Tohsaka has made elaborate preparations

49
04:47.839 --> 04:50.492
to try and ensure his victory in this Grail War.

50
04:51.280 --> 04:52.727
And it's also likely

51
04:53.094 --> 04:54.349
that in total secret

52
04:54.735 --> 04:57.919
he controlled Assassin's
master, Kirei Kotomine.

53
05:00.513 --> 05:04.737
If that's true, and Tohsaka exerts
some influence over Kotomine,

54
05:05.097 --> 05:08.796
then I believe it would be a mistake
if we choose to ignore this offer.

55
05:09.158 --> 05:10.658
Yes, you're right.

56
05:12.014 --> 05:13.923
Kirei Kotomine?

57
05:14.938 --> 05:16.704
Remember this, Saber,

58
05:17.476 --> 05:23.121
if there is anyone in this war who can defeat
Kiritsugu and claim the Holy Grail for himself,

59
05:23.587 --> 05:25.959
it is the man named Kirei Kotomine.

60
05:30.594 --> 05:31.789
Go and tell them.

61
05:32.342 --> 05:33.308
We accept.

62
05:44.069 --> 05:44.849
Father?

63
05:50.196 --> 05:51.136
Hi, Father!

64
06:05.571 --> 06:08.915
Rin, your father says that he
would like to speak with you.

65
06:28.314 --> 06:28.914
Rin...

66
06:29.778 --> 06:32.681
keep the Mage's Association
in your debt till you grow up.

67
06:33.875 --> 06:36.352
After that, I leave the rest to your judgment.

68
06:37.038 --> 06:39.895
I'm certain you'll be fine on your own.

69
06:40.982 --> 06:42.912
The Holy Grail will appear one day,

70
06:43.476 --> 06:46.080
it is the Tohsaka
family's duty to claim it.

71
06:46.593 --> 06:49.579
Above all, if you wish to be a mage, Rin,

72
06:49.848 --> 06:51.632
it's a path you cannot avoid.

73
06:53.262 --> 06:54.973
Here, take this.

74
06:55.619 --> 06:56.359
Oh!

75
07:01.468 --> 07:02.688
I have to go now.

76
07:03.715 --> 07:05.359
You know what to do, right?

77
07:06.352 --> 07:07.132
Yes.

78
07:10.479 --> 07:11.616
I'll see you soon.

79
07:11.696 --> 07:12.763
Take care, Father.

80
07:30.270 --> 07:34.263
First, allow me to thank you
for coming here at my behest.

81
07:35.043 --> 07:36.580
I very much appreciate it.

82
07:38.570 --> 07:41.277
Let me introduce Kirei Kotomine,

83
07:41.743 --> 07:43.270
my long‐time apprentice.

84
07:43.740 --> 07:47.377
While we were once honorable competitors
in this battle for the Holy Grail,

85
07:47.817 --> 07:49.930
all that is now in the past.

86
07:51.130 --> 07:55.775
He has lost his servant, and as a result,
has yielded his rights as a master.

87
07:56.788 --> 07:59.849
This Grail War is rapidly heading toward its conclusion.

88
08:00.590 --> 08:02.901
The one's remaining are, as anticipated,

89
08:03.141 --> 08:07.585
the masters of the three great
houses along with one outsider.

90
08:08.540 --> 08:11.961
Now, what is your appraisal
of the state of the war?

91
08:12.043 --> 08:13.374
I have no opinion.

92
08:13.683 --> 08:16.156
We control the most powerful servant, Saber,

93
08:16.373 --> 08:18.615
and don't need to wait for the best time to strike.

94
08:18.897 --> 08:21.079
We shall simply continue to win each battle.

95
08:21.876 --> 08:22.303
Hm.

96
08:22.970 --> 08:24.382
Unfortunately for the Matous,

97
08:24.950 --> 08:27.550
it is my opinion that they
erred in their strategy.

98
08:28.250 --> 08:34.244
They have imposed a draining servant upon a frail
master, thereby hastening his self‐destruction.

99
08:35.315 --> 08:37.767
Rider is likely to be the victor between them.

100
08:38.583 --> 08:41.968
The Grail must not be allowed
to fall into outside hands.

101
08:42.983 --> 08:46.422
The two of us should be able to agree on that much.

102
08:46.485 --> 08:48.335
Any alliance is out of the question.

103
08:48.940 --> 08:53.056
However, if you wish to discuss the
order in which we approach our enemies,

104
08:53.202 --> 08:55.651
we may be able to
come to some equitable agreement.

105
08:57.571 --> 08:58.425
Go on.

106
08:58.958 --> 09:01.491
We can settle things with the Tohsaka team

107
09:01.938 --> 09:03.890
after defeating the other masters.

108
09:04.337 --> 09:06.654
We are prepared to agree to such a proposal.

109
09:07.541 --> 09:10.124
So a temporary conditional ceasefire?

110
09:10.951 --> 09:12.592
That is a fair compromise.

111
09:13.652 --> 09:15.540
We have two conditions.

112
09:16.167 --> 09:21.046
The first is that you agree to share with us
any and all information you may have gathered

113
09:21.199 --> 09:23.285

concerning Rider and his master.

114
09:24.301 --> 09:25.217
Agreed.

115
09:25.511 --> 09:27.273
Our second condition is

116
09:27.761 --> 09:31.400
that Kirei Kotomine be removed
from the Holy Grail War.

117
09:35.467 --> 09:36.301
Kirei?

118
09:36.587 --> 09:39.276
I am not suggesting in any way he be killed,

119
09:39.629 --> 09:42.149
but I insist that until this battle is over,

120
09:42.174 --> 09:46.444
he be expelled from Fuyuki,
or better yet, from Japan entirely.

121
09:47.187 --> 09:48.964
Immediately, before morning.

122
09:51.161 --> 09:52.645
Would you explain why?

123
09:53.546 --> 09:55.001
Because of the bad blood

124
09:55.448 --> 09:58.811
between the Einzberns and the so‐called Inquisitor.

125
09:59.492 --> 10:02.180
If the Tohsaka team continues to protect him,

126
10:02.920 --> 10:06.937
we will find ourselves unable to
trust you under any circumstances.

127
10:08.031 --> 10:09.044
What does she mean?

128
10:11.539 --> 10:12.385
Kirei.

129
10:16.515 --> 10:19.583
Well, Saber,how do you 
like Kiritsugu's present?

130
10:19.889 --> 10:20.916
Very much so.

131
10:21.191 --> 10:23.266
It is more like a horse than a car is.

132
10:23.725 --> 10:25.246
It seems to suit me much better.

133
10:25.815 --> 10:27.232
I shall go ahead then

134
10:27.851 --> 10:29.831
and scout out the route ahead for us.

135
10:35.865 --> 10:37.320
We should go now as well.

136
10:42.955 --> 10:44.986
Ma... madam, what's the matter?

137
10:45.495 --> 10:47.255
Please drive, Maiya.

138
10:47.835 --> 10:48.561
You sure?

139
10:49.005 --> 10:51.849
Tohsaka will suspect something's wrong.

140
10:59.930 --> 11:02.457
What's happening to me really isn't unexpected.

141
11:03.395 --> 11:04.852
It was actually inevitable.

142
11:05.894 --> 11:13.271
Honestly, the fact that I've been able to function as
a human for this long... is really quite a miracle.

143
11:15.013 --> 11:16.993
Does Kiritsugu know about this?

144
11:17.334 --> 11:19.265
Yes, but don't tell Saber.

145
11:19.880 --> 11:22.484
She has a crucial battle
to fight ahead of her.

146
11:23.365 --> 11:25.634
I don't want to distract
her with all of this.

147
11:26.165 --> 11:29.760
But listen, Maiya,
there's something I need to tell you.

148
11:30.715 --> 11:34.880
I am a homunculus created
specifically for the Holy Grail War.

149
11:35.825 --> 11:37.273
You know about that, right?

150
11:37.791 --> 11:38.446
Yes.

151
11:39.104 --> 11:43.835
Grandfather Acht ingrained in the
vessel an instinct for self‐preservation

152
11:44.265 --> 11:48.856
so that it would avoid all danger and
safeguard the Grail to its completion.

153
11:49.185 --> 11:53.955
He disguised the vessel so he could hide
it in plain sight and called it Irisviel.

154
11:54.605 --> 11:56.390
That is who I am.

155
11:57.420 --> 11:58.278
But how?

156
11:58.735 --> 12:00.253
Then that means that you are...

157
12:00.405 --> 12:01.493
Very soon now.

158
12:01.785 --> 12:04.363
I will revert back to what I originally was.

159
12:05.205 --> 12:10.866
When that happens, I won't even be able to
talk to you or anyone else like this anymore.

160
12:11.665 --> 12:15.505
That's the reason why Kiritsugu
gave me Saber's scabbard to keep.

161
12:16.885 --> 12:20.254
Avalon, are you familiar with its effects?

162
12:20.550 --> 12:23.774
It halts aging and provides an infinite healing ability.

163
12:24.305 --> 12:25.549
Or so I'm told.

164
12:25.975 --> 12:29.319
Its effects are what have prevented
the hollow shell that is me

165
12:29.645 --> 12:31.399
from collapsing in on itself.

166
12:31.725 --> 12:35.581
Of course, they stop working
as soon as Saber is away.

167
12:36.155 --> 12:38.051
And I start to deteriorate.

168
12:38.381 --> 12:41.154
Madam, why are you telling me all this?

169
12:41.905 --> 12:47.216
Because, Maiya Hisau,
under no circumstances would you ever pity me.

170
12:48.143 --> 12:50.298
You would accept me for what I am.

171
12:50.955 --> 12:52.324
That's why I tell you.

172
12:52.585 --> 12:56.179
Madam, Irisviel, I'm afraid I've always

173
12:56.446 --> 12:58.443
thought that you were beyond my reach.

174
12:58.675 --> 13:00.282
No, I'm not really.

175
13:01.215 --> 13:02.359
Do you understand?

176
13:02.765 --> 13:03.386
Yes.

177
13:03.925 --> 13:07.398
Even if it costs me my life, Irisviel,

178
13:08.225 --> 13:10.592
I will see you through to the very end.

179
13:11.475 --> 13:12.547
And so please...

180
13:13.725 --> 13:16.335
please die now for Kiritsugu Emiya

181
13:17.355 --> 13:19.321
to make his dream a reality.

182
13:24.195 --> 13:25.110
Thank you.

183
13:27.750 --> 13:32.439
I really wish you had told me of your
troubled history with the Einzberns.

184
13:33.469 --> 13:36.179
Unfortunately, I have no choice.

185
13:37.679 --> 13:40.764
You must withdraw from the Holy Grail War

186
13:41.380 --> 13:42.385
immediately.

187
13:56.683 --> 14:00.926
Kiritsugu Emiya, who are you really?

188
14:03.229 --> 14:05.043
Will I leave this place

189
14:05.453 --> 14:06.953
never even learning that?

190
14:09.252 --> 14:11.808
Still thinking about what to do even now?

191
14:12.386 --> 14:15.324
Could you truly be so slow, Kirei?

192
14:16.980 --> 14:19.527
The Holy Grail beckons to you still.

193
14:20.747 --> 14:25.593
And even you yourself still long to
jump into the fight and claim it.

194
14:26.946 --> 14:28.726
For as long as I remember,

195
14:28.966 --> 14:32.057
I've spent my life in search of a single thing.

196
14:32.846 --> 14:34.579
I've devoted every moment

197
14:34.788 --> 14:36.580
and endured great pain for it,

198
14:36.846 --> 14:39.048
but all of that has come to naught.

199
14:40.029 --> 14:43.222
Yet I sense that the answer to my question

200
14:43.410 --> 14:46.373
is closer to me now than it has ever been before.

201
14:46.709 --> 14:48.788
After all of that self‐reflection,

202
14:49.033 --> 14:51.136
why in the world do you still hesitate?

203
14:51.589 --> 14:52.871
Because I fear

204
14:53.556 --> 14:55.772
that when I've learned all the answers,

205
14:56.163 --> 14:58.774
it will result in my utter destruction.

206
15:05.139 --> 15:06.968
Understood, well done.

207
15:08.893 --> 15:12.358
Ah, you've just received an
exciting bit of news, I take it.

208
15:12.699 --> 15:17.579
We've finally learned the exact location of the
stronghold where the Einzberns have been hiding.

209
15:19.359 --> 15:20.753
As I live and breathe!

210
15:20.813 --> 15:22.666
You honestly amaze me.

211
15:23.443 --> 15:26.340
You were planning to continue all
along, weren't you?

212
15:26.656 --> 15:28.194
I did hesitate.

213
15:28.677 --> 15:30.449
I was even prepared to give up.

214
15:31.263 --> 15:35.464
But in the end,
it is just as you say, Archer...

215
15:35.966 --> 15:41.205
I know no other way than to keep asking
the question until I find an answer.

216
15:42.269 --> 15:43.399
What is that?

217
15:44.559 --> 15:46.719
A gift from my father.

218
15:50.293 --> 15:52.139
JN424.

219
15:53.259 --> 15:54.785
The gospel of John.

220
15:56.859 --> 16:00.784
"God is spirit, and those who worship Him

221
16:00.996 --> 16:04.223
must worship in spirit and in truth."

222
16:09.106 --> 16:10.472
However, Kirei,

223
16:10.893 --> 16:14.056
there remains for you a rather grave problem.

224
16:14.533 --> 16:21.687
Were you to participate in the Holy Grail War on
your own behalf, Tokiomi Tohsaka becomes your enemy.

225
16:22.583 --> 16:25.971
In other words, you are in the
same room as an enemy's servant

226
16:26.178 --> 16:29.429
with no real plan to actually
defend yourself from him.

227
16:29.959 --> 16:32.434
A dire situation, would you not agree?

228
16:32.602 --> 16:34.001
No, not at all.

229
16:34.683 --> 16:37.147
I came with something to trade for my life.

230
16:37.483 --> 16:38.244
Really?

231
16:38.566 --> 16:39.770
Gilgamesh.

232
16:40.430 --> 16:45.262
Let me reveal to you the truth behind the
Holy Grail War that has been kept from you.

233
16:45.436 --> 16:46.539
And that is?

234
16:46.666 --> 16:49.281
The magical ritual held here in Fuyuki

235
16:49.664 --> 16:53.751
is an attempt by the winning mage to
open up a passage directly to the root

236
16:54.081 --> 16:57.465
by the sacrifice of the souls
of seven heroic spirits.

237
16:58.013 --> 17:03.686
The activation of the Holy Grail can only be
achieved by the killing of all seven servants.

238
17:04.099 --> 17:06.029
That's correct, all seven.

239
17:06.950 --> 17:08.229
You understand?

240
17:08.753 --> 17:13.008
That's the reason my master has worked
so hard to avoid using his command seals,

241
17:13.373 --> 17:19.845
because when all the battles are finally over, he will
require them to force his own servant to commit suicide.

242
17:20.866 --> 17:23.318
So then the loyalty Tokiomi has shown me

243
17:23.626 --> 17:26.277
has all been nothing but a lie from the very beginning?

244
17:26.510 --> 17:28.070
To put it yet another way,

245
17:28.302 --> 17:31.958
my master is first and foremost
a mage down to his very core.

246
17:33.236 --> 17:35.210
He may worship a heroic spirit,

247
17:35.346 --> 17:38.306
but he harbors no illusions about his idols.

248
17:39.280 --> 17:44.191
Well, Tokiomi, at last you have
shown some hint of promise.

249
17:44.633 --> 17:49.381
That dull excuse for a man will finally be able
to provide me with a measure of entertainment.

250
17:49.673 --> 17:52.376
Now then, what will you do, Gilgamesh?

251
17:52.593 --> 17:56.142
Will you now choose to remain loyal to Tokiomi

252
17:56.420 --> 17:58.999
and then punish me for rebelling against him?

253
17:59.123 --> 18:01.340
Ah, a fair question, indeed.

254
18:01.766 --> 18:03.462
Regardless of his treachery,

255
18:03.973 --> 18:06.923
Tokiomi still supplies me with the mana I require.

256
18:07.409 --> 18:12.127
Were I to abandon my master,it would 
hamper my ability to remain materialized.

257
18:12.829 --> 18:15.084
Oh, come to think of it,

258
18:15.258 --> 18:17.443
there is a partnerless master I know of.

259
18:17.863 --> 18:22.248
One who is actively searching for a servant
that is free and unbound by a contract.

260
18:22.582 --> 18:23.099
Hmph.

261
18:23.247 --> 18:25.298
Now that you mention it, you're right.

262
18:26.109 --> 18:28.051
But of course, there is a question

263
18:28.446 --> 18:32.476
of whether that man is a worthy master
in the eyes of the King of Heroes?

264
18:32.922 --> 18:34.362
He will suffice.

265
18:35.146 --> 18:37.666
He is a bit stiff and humorless, perhaps,

266
18:37.803 --> 18:39.905
but he has great potential for growth.

267
18:40.643 --> 18:44.499
He may yet prove himself a fine
source of entertainment for me.

268
18:45.853 --> 18:46.448
Hm.

269
18:49.773 --> 18:51.577
I've been waiting for you, Kirei.

270
18:51.733 --> 18:55.609
I came to say goodbye and thank
you before I departed Fuyuki.

271
18:58.593 --> 19:01.177
First, I'd like to say that I'm still very proud

272
19:01.533 --> 19:03.298
to have had you as my student.

273
19:04.203 --> 19:07.917
I hope you will maintain good
relations with the Tohsaka family,

274
19:08.074 --> 19:10.696
as throughout the years
your late father always did.

275
19:11.663 --> 19:12.469
All right?

276
19:13.489 --> 19:15.188
Your words honor me.

277
19:15.723 --> 19:18.421
Once this Grail War has finally come to an end,

278
19:18.470 --> 19:23.161
Kirei, I'd like for you to help train
my young daughter, Rin, to be a mage.

279
19:25.913 --> 19:29.450
It's rather simple, but in essence,
this is a will I've prepared.

280
19:30.137 --> 19:34.136
I thought it prudent to be ready in the event
the worst happened and I did not survive.

281
19:35.382 --> 19:38.657
It leaves the entire wealth
of the Tohsaka family to Rin.

282
19:39.156 --> 19:41.465
And names you as her legal guardian

283
19:42.013 --> 19:43.567
until she comes of age.

284
19:45.103 --> 19:46.523
Leave it to me.

285
19:46.696 --> 19:48.406
I shall do all I can

286
19:48.666 --> 19:51.653
to look after your daughter and keep her safe from any harm.

287
19:52.623 --> 19:53.448
Thank you.

288
19:54.549 --> 19:55.228
Kirei.

289
19:55.833 --> 19:56.765
What is this?

290
19:57.373 --> 19:58.875
A little something for you.

291
19:59.536 --> 20:00.717
A gift from me.

292
20:01.396 --> 20:02.101
Open it.

293
20:06.382 --> 20:07.755
An Azoth dagger.

294
20:08.626 --> 20:11.052
It symbolizes your mastery of magic,

295
20:11.389 --> 20:14.165
and marks the completion of your apprenticeship to me.

296
20:15.129 --> 20:16.479
I am without words.

297
20:16.663 --> 20:18.332
You are far too kind to me.

298
20:18.879 --> 20:20.647
I am filled with gratitude,

299
20:21.249 --> 20:22.324
my master.

300
20:23.029 --> 20:24.546
It is I who thanks you,

301
20:24.923 --> 20:26.036
Kirei Kotomine.

302
20:26.836 --> 20:30.595
Now I can finish preparing for
the final battle of this war.

303
20:32.886 --> 20:34.609
Oh my, look at the time.

304
20:36.008 --> 20:38.403
I'm sorry to have kept
you here for so long.

305
20:40.678 --> 20:42.612
I hope I haven't made you miss your flight.

306
20:50.620 --> 20:51.637
No.

307
20:53.373 --> 20:57.089
You needn't worry about it, my master.

308
21:05.193 --> 21:08.977
You see, I never got around to buying myself a ticket.

309
21:24.579 --> 21:25.571
Master.

310
21:26.516 --> 21:28.499
How like my father you were.

311
21:28.794 --> 21:34.120
Even at the very end, you never really
understood me or my inner motivations, did you?

312
21:39.896 --> 21:40.425
Hah.

313
21:40.663 --> 21:42.318
Such a boring end.

314
21:43.010 --> 21:43.967
Look at that.

315
21:44.266 --> 21:46.135
Such an idiotic expression.

316
21:46.759 --> 21:50.549
He did have a dematerialized
servant at hand that he depended on.

317
21:51.180 --> 21:53.608
It was natural for him to lower his guard.

318
21:53.796 --> 21:56.247
So, you have learned to adjust already, have you?

319
21:56.992 --> 21:59.433
I praise you for your studious aptitude.

320
22:00.522 --> 22:01.546
Well, Kirei?

321
22:02.003 --> 22:05.660
Do you feel a little better about not
having had the chance to kill your father?

322
22:06.956 --> 22:09.339
So you have no qualms about this,

323
22:09.780 --> 22:11.911
Gilgamesh, King of Heroes?

324
22:12.593 --> 22:15.673
No, not so long as you continue to amuse me.

325
22:16.499 --> 22:17.934
Otherwise, Kirei...

326
22:19.148 --> 22:22.804
Well, you are the one who ought
to question your own resolve.

327
22:25.503 --> 22:27.349
My will creates your body,

328
22:27.679 --> 22:29.655
and your sword creates my destiny.

329
22:30.086 --> 22:31.926
If you heed the Grail's call

330
22:32.052 --> 22:34.867
and also obey my will and my reason.

331
22:35.469 --> 22:39.012
Yes, I swear your offering will be my flesh,

332
22:39.366 --> 22:42.503
Kirei Kotomine, my new master.

333
22:46.193 --> 22:47.227
Now, Kirei,

334
22:47.652 --> 22:48.889
let us begin.

335
22:49.976 --> 22:51.833
Put an end to this farce,

336
22:52.423 --> 22:54.361
and as a reward for your loyalty,

337
22:54.832 --> 22:56.865
I shall give you the Holy Grail.

338
22:57.323 --> 23:00.066
Very well then, King of Heroes.

339
23:00.483 --> 23:02.823
May you have your fill of amusement from me.

340
23:03.013 --> 23:05.840
Until such time I find the answer I seek,

341
23:06.130 --> 23:09.181
I shall gladly play the fool for you.
