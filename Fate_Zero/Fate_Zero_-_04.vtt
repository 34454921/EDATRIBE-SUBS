1
00:13.871 --> 00:15.297
You have a charm spell.

2
00:17.154 --> 00:21.227
Apologies, but I'm afraid it's a
little curse that I was born with.

3
00:21.862 --> 00:24.368
There's really nothing that can be done about it.

4
00:24.830 --> 00:29.305
Blame it on my birth, or if you prefer,
the fact that you were born a woman.

5
00:29.944 --> 00:33.865
Surely you don't actually believe that
a pleasant face and a charming swagger

6
00:33.890 --> 00:36.796
will save you from the bite of my blade, spear man.

7
00:37.094 --> 00:39.870
I certainly hope not...  it would spoil the fun.

8
00:40.323 --> 00:44.738
I see now that the tales of the Saber
classes' resistance to magic are true.

9
00:45.245 --> 00:49.143
Very well... I prefer not to kill a
girl who's throwing herself at me.

10
00:49.685 --> 00:51.298
It would sully my reputation.

11
00:51.677 --> 00:54.822
I'm pleased that my first opponent is made of stern stuff.

12
00:54.915 --> 00:58.647
Oh, so what you desire is a fair fight.

13
00:59.220 --> 01:01.569
I consider myself fortunate to encounter

14
01:01.775 --> 01:03.628
such a strong and proud hero.

15
01:03.994 --> 01:07.378
Then let us begin.

16
01:33.062 --> 01:34.176
It's started.

17
01:35.556 --> 01:37.542
Someone has put up a barrier,

18
01:38.306 --> 01:40.641
probably the master of the enemy's servant.

19
01:41.334 --> 01:46.082
From up on that crane, it would be
possible to survey the whole battlefield.

20
01:46.802 --> 01:50.007
Indeed... that certainly is the best vantage point.

21
01:50.770 --> 01:53.162
Anyone seeing it would agree.

22
01:54.046 --> 01:56.809
All right, you circle around to the Eastern Wharf.

23
01:57.092 --> 01:59.004
I'll go the other way and take the west.

24
01:59.252 --> 02:01.206
You and I need to find good spots

25
02:01.346 --> 02:06.597
where we can be totally invisible while we closely
monitor both Saber's battle and that crane, got it?

26
02:06.719 --> 02:07.945
Yes, understood.

27
02:13.056 --> 02:15.798
Now, then, let's see what you can do,

28
02:16.131 --> 02:18.018
my adorable King of Knights.

29
04:10.396 --> 04:13.368
Saber is watching both spears simultaneously.

30
04:14.146 --> 04:18.740
Lancer's greatest advantage is his opponent's
uncertainty as to which he will use.

31
04:19.656 --> 04:23.170
The long spear in the right hand
or the short spear in the left?

32
04:23.486 --> 04:25.207
Which was the Noble Phantasm?

33
04:25.759 --> 04:29.806
If I could be certain which one it
was, I could attack and defeat him.

34
04:31.536 --> 04:33.495
If only we knew his true name.

35
04:39.061 --> 04:41.698
Whoever he is, he's a master of the spear.

36
04:42.142 --> 04:44.193
However, that is not enough.

37
04:55.621 --> 04:56.942
What's wrong, Saber?

38
04:57.372 --> 04:58.737
You're on the defensive.

39
04:59.566 --> 05:01.050
This man is impressive.

40
05:19.986 --> 05:21.832
Curse that blade of hers.

41
05:22.506 --> 05:24.316
Without knowing its exact length,

42
05:24.596 --> 05:26.543
I can't get close enough to strike.

43
05:28.306 --> 05:31.283
The fact that she's able to repel my strikes so easily

44
05:31.571 --> 05:34.097
means that she must be a master swordsman.

45
06:02.926 --> 06:07.425
Hmm, Maiya, northeast of Saber and Iri.

46
06:08.466 --> 06:12.079
On the roof of that warehouse, it's Lancer's master.

47
06:12.556 --> 06:13.634
Can you see him?

48
06:16.106 --> 06:18.911
Negative... I can't see him from my position.

49
06:20.026 --> 06:20.839
Understood.

50
06:21.269 --> 06:22.652
I'll take him out from here.

51
06:37.012 --> 06:38.076
Assassin?

52
06:40.966 --> 06:44.945
There is activity at the warehouse
district at the mouth of the Mion River.

53
06:45.546 --> 06:49.351
It seems the first battle has finally begun.

54
06:50.176 --> 06:51.627
Not the first battle.

55
06:52.226 --> 06:55.016
To the others, this would be the second battle, Kirei.

56
06:57.146 --> 07:01.518
It would appear that Lancer and
Saber are the combatants in this one.

57
07:02.066 --> 07:05.728
Can you ascertain their status utilizing Assassin's eyes?

58
07:06.236 --> 07:07.434
With ease.

59
07:07.826 --> 07:11.013
Saber's formidable abilities are especially high.

60
07:11.446 --> 07:15.461
Most of her parameters are ranked
A or higher on the standard scale.

61
07:16.626 --> 07:17.509
I see.

62
07:17.869 --> 07:20.604
It's no wonder they are considered the strongest class.

63
07:21.110 --> 07:24.235
Saber likely presents a greater threat than Lancer.

64
07:25.466 --> 07:27.155
Can you see other masters?

65
07:27.846 --> 07:32.949
There's only one person besides the servants
who is out in the open and visible to Assassin.

66
07:33.556 --> 07:35.539
She's standing next to Saber.

67
07:35.976 --> 07:38.287
It's a woman with silver hair.

68
07:38.686 --> 07:46.707
Huh, that means that Lancer's master is wise enough to
remain hidden from view, and that he's not a novice.

69
07:47.195 --> 07:50.397
He understands the rules of the Holy Grail War.

70
07:51.906 --> 07:54.196
Wait a minute... a silver‐haired woman?

71
07:54.286 --> 07:56.324
Yes, a Caucasian...

72
07:59.036 --> 08:02.120
with silver hair and red eyes.

73
08:03.189 --> 08:04.695
Very unusual.

74
08:05.051 --> 08:07.103
She doesn't look at all human.

75
08:08.168 --> 08:10.213
An Einzbern Homunculus.

76
08:11.056 --> 08:14.052
It seems they created another artificial master.

77
08:14.766 --> 08:18.149
I thought that the only pawn Yupstehide had on the board

78
08:18.381 --> 08:19.937
was Kiritsugu Emiya.

79
08:20.396 --> 08:22.476
It would appear that I was wrong.

80
08:23.659 --> 08:27.606
So then that woman is the Einzbern master?

81
08:29.226 --> 08:34.479
Either way, she's certainly going to be a critical
factor throughout the rest of the Grail War.

82
08:34.746 --> 08:37.020
Kirei, keep a close eye on her.

83
08:38.105 --> 08:39.186
Agreed.

84
08:39.869 --> 08:43.656
I shall keep one Assassin tasked to her at all times.

85
08:46.505 --> 08:47.528
I see him, too.

86
08:48.256 --> 08:51.518
But Assassin should be dead, so why is he here?

87
08:52.176 --> 08:53.799
I knew something had to be up.

88
08:57.556 --> 08:59.531
Let's see how this all plays out.

89
09:00.266 --> 09:02.177
Continue to observe Assassin.

90
09:02.726 --> 09:03.943
I'll watch Lancer.

91
09:04.976 --> 09:06.971
Let me launch an attack on Assassin.

92
09:07.276 --> 09:09.673
And then, while I have him distracted,

93
09:09.946 --> 09:11.746
you can take out Lancer's master.

94
09:11.865 --> 09:13.005
No, Maiya.

95
09:13.881 --> 09:16.806
I don't want you to make any moves against Assassin.

96
09:17.906 --> 09:20.240
We're not equipped to fight servants right now.

97
09:20.416 --> 09:21.819
It would be disastrous.

98
09:24.206 --> 09:25.034
Understood.

99
09:35.506 --> 09:40.090
There is really no honor in a battle
fought without a proper exchange of names,

100
09:40.618 --> 09:42.909
but allow me to offer my regards.

101
09:43.146 --> 09:45.476
It's impressive for a woman to fight so hard

102
09:45.501 --> 09:47.754
without even breaking a sweat as she does it.

103
09:47.986 --> 09:50.469
You needn't be so humble, Lancer.

104
09:50.946 --> 09:52.829
Even without my knowing your name,

105
09:52.981 --> 09:56.888
those words from such a master of the spear do me honor.

106
09:57.536 --> 09:58.981
I gratefully accept them.

107
09:59.406 --> 10:01.661
That's enough fun for now, Lancer.

108
10:03.979 --> 10:04.907
Lancer's master?

109
10:06.336 --> 10:08.595
Do not allow this battle to go on.

110
10:09.006 --> 10:11.476
Saber is a formidable opponent.

111
10:11.546 --> 10:13.494
Eliminate her at once.

112
10:14.136 --> 10:16.613
You may use your Noble Phantasm.

113
10:20.016 --> 10:23.160
As you command, I will comply.

114
10:29.146 --> 10:32.279
So the long spear is his Noble Phantasm.

115
10:39.906 --> 10:41.267
You heard the command.

116
10:41.456 --> 10:44.414
The time has come for me to kill you.

117
10:45.061 --> 10:48.466
Saber, are you using focused wind mana

118
10:48.876 --> 10:50.918
to keep your blade concealed?

119
10:52.876 --> 10:53.716
I see.

120
10:54.389 --> 10:57.056
I'll wager that you have a very good reason

121
10:57.426 --> 10:59.417
to conceal your sword from me.

122
11:00.466 --> 11:03.190
I think the sword reveals your true name.

123
11:03.936 --> 11:05.618
How unfortunate for you.

124
11:06.186 --> 11:09.108
I'm afraid you'll never know the true name of my blade.

125
11:10.371 --> 11:13.231
I'll finish this before you ever get the chance.

126
11:14.066 --> 11:15.626
We shall see about that.

127
11:16.236 --> 11:19.503
I will discover whatever it is you're hiding, Saber.

128
11:27.626 --> 11:30.730
You've exposed your sword to me.

129
11:31.065 --> 11:33.689
The Invisible Air is coming apart.

130
11:55.465 --> 11:56.965
What's going on with Saber?

131
12:12.456 --> 12:16.586
That red spear is chipping away at the Invisible Air.

132
12:17.126 --> 12:19.656
I've figured out the length of your blade now,

133
12:19.796 --> 12:23.459
so I needn't worry about being struck by you anymore!

134
12:29.146 --> 12:31.179
He wields a formidable weapon,

135
12:31.399 --> 12:32.901
but I still have ways to counter it.

136
12:39.816 --> 12:41.527
If I wait for an attack...

137
12:45.656 --> 12:47.557
...one less powerful than the rest.

138
13:21.445 --> 13:22.171
Saber?

139
13:27.746 --> 13:29.383
My thanks, Irisviel.

140
13:30.036 --> 13:33.934
I'm fine... the healing is working.

141
13:34.546 --> 13:38.176
I see... so this won't be an easy victory after all.

142
13:38.891 --> 13:40.262
How could this be?

143
13:40.710 --> 13:43.796
My armor should've easily deflected that strike.

144
13:44.811 --> 13:47.633
So how did the blade of his spear...

145
13:53.226 --> 13:55.178
The armor itself isn't damaged.

146
13:55.646 --> 13:56.952
What's at work here?

147
14:00.316 --> 14:04.787
The only answer is that Lancer's spear
bypassed the magically woven armor.

148
14:06.036 --> 14:07.096
So that's it.

149
14:07.536 --> 14:10.373
I know the secret of your spear, Lancer.

150
14:10.616 --> 14:11.194
Oh?

151
14:11.746 --> 14:15.013
That red spear of yours is able to negate magic.

152
14:15.286 --> 14:15.813
Hmm.

153
14:16.322 --> 14:19.242
So your armor was created using magic, huh?

154
14:19.416 --> 14:24.702
Well, if you were counting on it to protect
you, you should surrender now, Saber.

155
14:25.386 --> 14:28.143
You're as good as naked before my spear.

156
14:29.422 --> 14:31.564
Don't think that simply defeating my armor

157
14:31.726 --> 14:34.010
will give you the upper hand in this fight.

158
14:40.936 --> 14:42.743
If I cannot block your blade,

159
14:43.196 --> 14:45.633
I need only kill you before it strikes.

160
14:46.838 --> 14:49.297
Prepare to die, Lancer!

161
14:50.786 --> 14:51.938
A bold move.

162
14:52.897 --> 14:55.664
You're betting everything on a single strike.

163
14:56.876 --> 15:00.424
You are attempting to overcome the
disadvantage of your broken armor

164
15:00.449 --> 15:03.015
with the advantages you gain by abandoning it.

165
15:03.676 --> 15:04.694
Excellent.

166
15:04.995 --> 15:06.705
A courageous decision.

167
15:07.846 --> 15:10.553
I like it... it's audacious and bold.

168
15:12.671 --> 15:17.911
But in this case, I'm afraid that it
was a very foolish mistake, Saber.

169
15:19.112 --> 15:20.412
We shall see.

170
15:21.887 --> 15:25.191
You can tell me your opinion again after my next attack.

171
15:41.951 --> 15:43.372
That was a misstep.

172
15:49.386 --> 15:52.362
A Noble Phantasm needn't be merely a single weapon.

173
15:53.151 --> 15:54.062
A trap!

174
16:06.159 --> 16:08.802
This is extremely bad.

175
16:09.448 --> 16:10.814
What is?

176
16:11.180 --> 16:14.483
Lancer has begun his ultimate attack.

177
16:15.060 --> 16:17.144
He intends to end the battle here.

178
16:17.560 --> 16:20.196
Well, wouldn't that be a lot better for us?

179
16:20.770 --> 16:21.596
Ahh!

180
16:21.900 --> 16:24.166
You idiot... what are you talking about?

181
16:25.440 --> 16:29.198
I wanted to sit back and watch until
we saw a few more masters fight.

182
16:29.680 --> 16:32.488
But at this rate, Saber may just fall.

183
16:33.450 --> 16:35.350
And then it will be too late.

184
16:36.290 --> 16:38.495
T... t... too late for what?

185
16:39.410 --> 16:43.603
I mean, the plan was to attack after they'd
fought a few battles and weakened each other.

186
16:44.500 --> 16:50.450
I have to admit that I had really hoped at least one other
servant would've been sent out to answer Lancer's challenge,

187
16:50.760 --> 16:55.368
because, of course, it would be
much faster to fight them altogether

188
16:55.550 --> 16:58.150
than to seek them all out one by one.

189
16:59.600 --> 17:02.104
You wanna fight 'em together?

190
17:02.560 --> 17:03.479
Indeed!

191
17:03.770 --> 17:09.104
Rarely does one have the extraordinary chance to
exchange blows with great heroes from another time.

192
17:09.440 --> 17:11.848
And with a chance to fight as many as six of them,

193
17:12.110 --> 17:14.420
I'd hate to miss out on a single one.

194
17:14.896 --> 17:16.940
Just observe Saber and Lancer.

195
17:17.330 --> 17:22.549
Both of them are strong, valiant warriors whom I
would dearly love to face in an all‐out battle.

196
17:23.000 --> 17:24.997
I cannot let either one die.

197
17:26.056 --> 17:27.703
But isn't that the whole point?

198
17:27.800 --> 17:31.038
The Grail Wars objective is to kill one another isn't it?

199
17:35.050 --> 17:37.023
To win, but never to destroy,

200
17:37.430 --> 17:39.888
to subjugate, but never to humiliate... 

201
17:40.310 --> 17:43.184
that is a truly good and honorable conquest.

202
17:58.783 --> 18:00.878
Now, we will watch no longer!

203
18:01.040 --> 18:02.935
We shall join the fray, boy!

204
18:03.115 --> 18:04.101
Let us go!

205
18:04.420 --> 18:05.845
You stupid idiot!

206
18:06.000 --> 18:08.567
What you're doing is totally insane!

207
18:08.920 --> 18:12.772
If you really don't approve,
then why don't you just stay up here and observe?

208
18:13.010 --> 18:14.158
No, I'll go!

209
18:14.340 --> 18:16.193
Take me with you, dammit!

210
18:16.720 --> 18:19.313
Excellent, that is my master.

211
18:30.106 --> 18:32.304
Not good... he severed the tendon.

212
18:32.862 --> 18:34.519
I can't move my thumb.

213
18:35.545 --> 18:36.574
Good counter.

214
18:36.946 --> 18:39.240
You aren't gonna make this easy for me, are you?

215
18:40.076 --> 18:43.176
But I like your indomitable spirit.

216
18:45.021 --> 18:47.696
Stop talking and get to work, you fool!

217
18:47.825 --> 18:50.219
Finish her... what are you waiting for?

218
18:54.640 --> 18:57.392
My master... much appreciated.

219
18:58.100 --> 19:01.393
Irisviel, I require healing.

220
19:01.877 --> 19:02.908
But I have.

221
19:03.545 --> 19:04.697
I've already done it.

222
19:05.295 --> 19:09.922
I mean, I did it... the healing worked, I'm certain of it!

223
19:10.345 --> 19:12.825
Saber, you should already be fully healed!

224
19:13.015 --> 19:14.358
I don't understand!

225
19:14.847 --> 19:17.140
It was very sharp of you to figure out,

226
19:17.446 --> 19:20.461
that my Gae Dearg was able to penetrate any armor,

227
19:21.395 --> 19:24.282
but it was foolish to abandon it.

228
19:26.815 --> 19:28.070
Had you not done so,

229
19:28.405 --> 19:30.203
my Gae Buidhe would not have gotten you.

230
19:31.075 --> 19:31.804
I see.

231
19:32.205 --> 19:33.630
You wield a cursed spear,

232
19:33.745 --> 19:36.801
which inflicts devastating wounds that can never be healed.

233
19:37.770 --> 19:39.702
I should've realized it sooner.

234
19:41.255 --> 19:43.334
A red spear that destroys magic,

235
19:43.527 --> 19:48.308
a cursed yellow spear, and beneath the right
eye, a mole that enchants women.

236
19:48.885 --> 19:50.685
First of the Knights of Fianna,

237
19:51.055 --> 19:52.967
Diarmuid of the Love Spot.

238
19:53.488 --> 19:57.275
Never did I think I'd have the honor of facing you in combat.

239
19:58.435 --> 20:01.842
Such is a sublime pleasure of the Holy Grail War,

240
20:02.435 --> 20:05.612
but it's I who has the distinct honor here.

241
20:06.445 --> 20:09.584
No hero summoned into service by the Holy Grail

242
20:09.945 --> 20:12.597
could ever mistake that golden blade.

243
20:13.865 --> 20:16.827
To face the legendary King of Knights in battle

244
20:17.035 --> 20:21.868
and land even a single glancing blow is extraordinary.

245
20:22.125 --> 20:23.607
I must not be too bad.

246
20:24.505 --> 20:27.459
Now then, since we both know each other's name,

247
20:27.894 --> 20:30.513
we can finally conduct our duel honorably

248
20:30.755 --> 20:31.786
as knights should.

249
20:32.635 --> 20:34.206
Or does this displease you,

250
20:34.475 --> 20:37.116
occurring only after you've lost use of an arm?

251
20:42.645 --> 20:43.665
You jest.

252
20:44.485 --> 20:47.482
It is humiliating that you would show so much concern

253
20:47.695 --> 20:49.084
over such a scratch.

254
20:52.235 --> 20:53.922
Prepare yourself, Saber!

255
20:54.575 --> 20:55.788
This time you're mine!

256
20:56.075 --> 21:00.392
Only if I fail to inflict the first decisive strike, Lancer.

257
21:10.195 --> 21:11.828
That's a chariot!

258
21:22.395 --> 21:24.395
Both of you, sheath your blades,

259
21:25.065 --> 21:26.375
for I am a King!

260
21:30.655 --> 21:33.312
I am Iskander, King of Conquerors!

261
21:33.865 --> 21:35.645
In this battle for the Holy Grail,

262
21:36.020 --> 21:38.446
I am of the Rider class of servants!

263
23:25.645 --> 23:27.935
I am Iskander, the King of Conquerors!

264
23:27.935 --> 23:29.685
I can't read his status or anything else!

265
23:29.685 --> 23:30.985
Irisviel, get back!

266
23:30.985 --> 23:32.605
That is his Noble Phantasm.

267
23:32.605 --> 23:34.485
With my Command Seal, I order you.

268
23:34.485 --> 23:36.065
Please believe in your master!

269
23:36.065 --> 23:38.075
At last she has come back to life!

270
23:38.075 --> 23:40.195
Nothing will remain of your corpse!
