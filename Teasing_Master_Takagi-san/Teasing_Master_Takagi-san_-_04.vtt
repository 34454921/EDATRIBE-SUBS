00:05.540 --> 00:07.120
All right, buddy,

2
00:07.200 --> 00:08.450
I'm sure you know,

3
00:08.540 --> 00:11.010
but you've been way too loud during class lately.

4
00:11.700 --> 00:13.870
I expect you to shape up.

5
00:13.950 --> 00:16.000
Uh. Yes, sir.

6
00:16.080 --> 00:17.910
Sorry about that

7
00:18.000 --> 00:21.080
So I'm putting you in charge of
cleaning the science room after school.

8
00:21.080 --> 00:22.370
Huh?

9
00:22.450 --> 00:24.870
Don't forget to wipe the desks down, too.

10
00:24.950 --> 00:26.250
Huh?!

11
02:05.200 --> 02:07.210
It's not fair that it's just me.

12
02:07.580 --> 02:09.580
Takagi should be getting punished, too.

13
02:09.660 --> 02:12.480
She's the one who's always teasing me during class.

14
02:15.080 --> 02:18.000
But I guess the problem is
that my reactions are too loud.

15
02:18.290 --> 02:20.450
Let's just get this over with and head--

16
02:22.040 --> 02:24.290
What are you doing hiding in the closet?

17
02:25.910 --> 02:28.160
I was trying to scare you.

18
02:29.620 --> 02:30.790
Ahh...

19
02:30.870 --> 02:33.250
That was so worth having to waste time in there.

20
02:33.330 --> 02:36.750
Wait. Lemme guess, you have to clean as punishment, too?

21
02:38.200 --> 02:40.010
Why don't we just get it over with?

22
02:41.540 --> 02:42.950
Okay?

23
02:45.410 --> 02:47.750
So, I have a proposal for you.

24
02:47.830 --> 02:49.120
Before we start,

25
02:49.200 --> 02:51.580
let's make a game out of cleaning, so it's more fun.

26
02:51.660 --> 02:52.790
A game?

27
02:52.870 --> 02:53.830
Yep.

28
02:53.910 --> 02:58.240
How about we do rock-paper-scissors,
and the loser has to clean a quarter of the room?

29
02:58.310 --> 02:59.050
You in?

30
03:00.410 --> 03:01.330
Hold on.

31
03:01.410 --> 03:04.830
That means if I win all four times,
I won't have to clean anything!

32
03:05.330 --> 03:06.790
Heh! Sure.

33
03:06.870 --> 03:09.140
All right, let's get started.

34
03:09.620 --> 03:10.500
Round one!

35
03:10.580 --> 03:11.700
I'll use rock.

36
03:12.970 --> 03:14.930
Why's she telling me what she's gonna choose?

37
03:15.040 --> 03:17.500
Rock. So if I go with paper, I'll win?

38
03:17.620 --> 03:19.540
But she knows that, so--!

39
03:26.660 --> 03:28.500
I told you I was going with rock.

40
03:28.580 --> 03:30.120
I hate you!

41
03:30.200 --> 03:31.920
You need to trust me more.

42
03:32.250 --> 03:33.620
I won't be tricked twice.

43
03:33.700 --> 03:35.450
I'll take her word for it next time.

44
03:35.540 --> 03:36.150
Oh!

45
03:36.280 --> 03:38.790
And I'm not gonna tell you what I'm picking anymore.

46
03:43.080 --> 03:43.870
Man.

47
03:43.950 --> 03:45.080
I knew it.

48
03:45.160 --> 03:47.330
She's messing with me again.

49
03:48.120 --> 03:49.290
Hmm?

50
03:49.370 --> 03:50.290
Nishikata!

51
03:50.370 --> 03:53.120
Uh. Hey, Nakai!

52
03:53.200 --> 03:54.830
What's going' on in here?

53
03:54.910 --> 03:56.830
You two just felt like hanging' out?

54
03:56.910 --> 04:00.260
No, I was loud in class,
so I have to clean the room as punishment.

55
04:00.700 --> 04:03.030
Hm. That's rough, man.

56
04:03.280 --> 04:04.540
What about you?

57
04:04.620 --> 04:08.040
Me? I'm, uh...

58
04:08.120 --> 04:10.250
...just hanging' around.

59
04:10.330 --> 04:11.450
You know.

60
04:11.540 --> 04:12.810
Oh. Okay.

61
04:14.700 --> 04:15.660
Hey, Nakai.

62
04:15.750 --> 04:17.450
Let's not get in their way, yeah?

63
04:17.540 --> 04:19.540
Oh. You're right.

64
04:19.620 --> 04:21.620
Well, we'll be on our way.

65
04:21.700 --> 04:24.040
Cool. See yah around.

66
04:24.120 --> 04:25.540
Oh, and Nishikata.

67
04:25.620 --> 04:27.660
Huh?

68
04:27.750 --> 04:29.250
Good luck to yah, dude!

69
04:29.330 --> 04:31.200
Uh. Oh, right.

70
04:31.290 --> 04:33.290
With this?

71
04:33.320 --> 04:35.120
Come on, let's just get out of here.

72
04:35.200 --> 04:37.250
Sorry, Takagi!

73
04:37.330 --> 04:38.160
Mm-hm.

74
04:38.250 --> 04:39.460
See yah!

75
04:40.160 --> 04:43.040
By the way, bet you didn't know.

76
04:43.120 --> 04:44.410
They're going out.

77
04:44.450 --> 04:45.910
Wait, what? They are?

78
04:46.000 --> 04:48.700
Seriously? I had no idea.

79
04:48.790 --> 04:52.100
I mean, I did notice them hanging
out a lot lately, but still...

80
04:52.290 --> 04:54.080
It's not like they're trying to hide it.

81
04:54.160 --> 04:57.250
It's just that they're both the kind
of people who wouldn't announce it.

82
04:57.250 --> 04:58.660
True.

83
04:58.750 --> 05:02.450
He said he's hanging around, and she was with him.

84
05:02.540 --> 05:06.100
But if you notice,
they were on their way to the rooftop.

85
05:06.580 --> 05:08.420
The... The rooftop?

86
05:08.870 --> 05:10.620
And right about now,

87
05:10.700 --> 05:13.000
they're probably all alone up there.

88
05:13.080 --> 05:16.080
Huh? Just the two of them?

89
05:19.790 --> 05:20.620
You gonna clean?

90
05:20.700 --> 05:22.580
Huh? Uh. Yeah!

91
05:22.660 --> 05:23.750
I am.

92
05:29.200 --> 05:32.490
Aww. Enjoying their time.

93
05:32.860 --> 05:34.330
With each other.

94
05:34.700 --> 05:36.580
Up there together.

95
05:36.660 --> 05:37.580
I wonder what--

96
05:37.580 --> 05:39.870
I wonder what it's like.

97
05:42.000 --> 05:43.590
Up there.

98
05:48.800 --> 05:50.080
Right?

99
05:53.450 --> 05:55.630
Yeah. I guess so.

100
06:05.040 --> 06:06.620
Hey. I finished.

101
06:07.330 --> 06:09.040
Okay, then.

102
06:12.250 --> 06:14.200
Rock, paper, scissors.

103
06:16.040 --> 06:18.830
How did I end up losing every time?

104
06:20.420 --> 06:23.010
Well, that's finally done!

105
06:23.870 --> 06:25.580
Let's go. It's getting late.

106
06:25.910 --> 06:27.020
So casual.

107
06:27.020 --> 06:30.000
I hope you learned your lesson
and won't tease me in class now.

108
06:30.080 --> 06:31.080
I guess.

109
06:31.160 --> 06:32.580
I could always just be more discreet.

110
06:32.660 --> 06:34.790
We're gonna get in trouble no matter what!

111
06:34.870 --> 06:37.410
Yeah, well, if it happens, it happens.

112
06:39.040 --> 06:40.290
Not to mention.

113
06:40.370 --> 06:42.870
I wasn't even told to clean in the first place.

114
06:42.950 --> 06:44.920
Huh? You've gotta be kidding!

115
06:45.290 --> 06:46.700
Okay, for real.

116
06:46.700 --> 06:49.250
Why am I the only one who gets in trouble all the time?

117
06:49.330 --> 06:52.820
So you're just here to mess with me, like usual?

118
06:54.160 --> 06:55.580
There's that, but...

119
06:56.760 --> 06:59.870
...I wanted to enjoy my time, too.

120
06:59.950 --> 07:04.400
Huh? Enjoy...

121
07:05.080 --> 07:08.000
...your time?

122
07:09.620 --> 07:12.740
And on that note,
you're buying me juice on our way home.

123
07:12.790 --> 07:14.700
What? Why?

124
07:20.910 --> 07:22.500
The sun's killing me.

125
07:22.580 --> 07:23.830
Yeah, me too.

126
07:23.910 --> 07:25.450
I'm really thirsty.

127
07:27.700 --> 07:28.950
Oh! I know.

128
07:29.040 --> 07:31.710
How about a competition and the loser buys drinks.

129
07:34.500 --> 07:36.040
Yeah, why not?

130
07:36.120 --> 07:38.160
Can I decide what we compete in then?

131
07:38.250 --> 07:39.730
Think I've got a good idea.

132
07:40.910 --> 07:42.220
The high bar?

133
07:42.450 --> 07:47.070
Uh-huh. Whichever one of us can't do a
kickover on the high bar is the loser.

134
07:48.750 --> 07:51.880
I just happened to try doing a
kickover on the high bar recently.

135
07:52.040 --> 07:56.660
And bam! I was actually able to
for the first time in my life!

136
07:56.660 --> 08:00.720
Ever since then, I've been itching' for
my chance to show Takagi up in a duel!

137
08:01.000 --> 08:04.610
To be honest, I wouldn't be all that
surprised if she could do one, too.

138
08:05.950 --> 08:06.910
But!

139
08:07.000 --> 08:08.480
Hey, Nishikata.

140
08:08.830 --> 08:11.670
You realize, I'm wearing a skirt, right?

141
08:12.050 --> 08:13.790
Exactly!

142
08:13.870 --> 08:16.500
Can't flip over the bar wearing a skirt!

143
08:16.580 --> 08:18.080
She's unable to compete!

144
08:18.160 --> 08:20.040
I win!

145
08:20.120 --> 08:21.160
Oh, well.

146
08:21.250 --> 08:23.330
I call dibs on going first, then.

147
08:23.410 --> 08:25.080
Eh?

148
08:25.160 --> 08:27.040
Really? You want to?

149
08:27.120 --> 08:28.410
Yeah, it's fine.

150
08:28.500 --> 08:31.330
However, I'd like to add one extra rule.

151
08:31.410 --> 08:32.540
You can't watch me.

152
08:32.620 --> 08:33.500
Huh?

153
08:33.580 --> 08:34.750
You're surprised?

154
08:34.830 --> 08:36.870
I am wearing a skirt.

155
08:36.950 --> 08:40.970
So if you look at me on my turn, then you're the loser.

156
08:42.910 --> 08:44.320
Here I go!

157
08:54.700 --> 08:55.600
Okay.

158
08:55.870 --> 08:58.410
Your turn, show me what you got.

159
09:00.080 --> 09:01.540
Did she really do it?

160
09:01.620 --> 09:03.500
I have no way of knowing.

161
09:03.580 --> 09:05.660
Whatever, now's not the time.

162
09:06.660 --> 09:09.450
I've gotta focus on the task at hand!

163
09:13.950 --> 09:15.450
Whoa.

164
09:16.870 --> 09:18.580
Well, we both were able to do it.

165
09:18.660 --> 09:20.000
So what now?

166
09:20.080 --> 09:21.720
One more time. Do over.

167
09:22.450 --> 09:23.500
All right.

168
09:23.580 --> 09:25.860
Then I'll go first again, 'Kay?

169
09:27.660 --> 09:29.160
No hesitation.

170
09:29.250 --> 09:30.750
That's not a good sign.

171
09:30.830 --> 09:33.510
She's either really confident or hiding something.

172
09:34.200 --> 09:36.830
I bet she's not even doing a kickover.

173
09:36.910 --> 09:39.450
She said I lose if I look during her turn.

174
09:39.540 --> 09:42.000
But it's a different story if she's cheating.

175
09:42.080 --> 09:44.720
Today's the day that I finally beat her!

176
09:53.200 --> 09:54.370
No way!

177
09:54.410 --> 09:55.990
She's actually doing it?

178
10:03.660 --> 10:05.130
Shorts?!

179
10:09.250 --> 10:10.000
I'm done.

180
10:10.080 --> 10:11.750
You can turn around now.

181
10:14.910 --> 10:16.120
What's wrong?

182
10:16.200 --> 10:17.670
Sorry, Takagi.

183
10:18.410 --> 10:19.910
I lose.

184
10:25.620 --> 10:26.290
Here.

185
10:26.370 --> 10:28.370
Thanks.

186
10:28.450 --> 10:30.620
Though, I don't really feel like a winner.

187
10:30.700 --> 10:33.060
Since you disqualified yourself and all.

188
10:37.000 --> 10:38.080
Yeah, about that.

189
10:38.160 --> 10:42.050
If you had shorts on the whole time,
then why didn't you let me watch you do it?

190
10:48.170 --> 10:49.250
Pervert.

191
10:54.720 --> 10:56.830
Hey, don't get the wrong idea!

192
10:56.910 --> 11:00.080
I just wanted to make sure you were
actually swinging over the bar!

193
11:00.080 --> 11:01.160
Really?

194
11:01.250 --> 11:02.740
Yes, really!

195
11:03.250 --> 11:04.580
All right, then.

196
11:04.660 --> 11:07.200
So you thought I was cheating, is that it?

197
11:07.290 --> 11:10.750
What?! No, I just... Ugh...

198
11:29.040 --> 11:30.830
All right, what's the big idea?

199
11:30.910 --> 11:34.300
Why are you always picking on me, day in and day out?

200
11:38.540 --> 11:40.000
It's nothing.

201
11:41.370 --> 11:43.520
Huh? Ba-dump!

202
11:48.370 --> 11:51.590
Be straight. You like being treated this way, don't you?

203
11:52.000 --> 11:54.790
Ahh... Squeal!

204
11:54.870 --> 11:55.760
I said,

205
11:55.760 --> 11:58.080
"You like being treated this way, don't you?"

206
11:58.160 --> 12:00.840
Ahh... Squeal!

207
12:01.450 --> 12:04.580
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> is so good!

208
12:14.040 --> 12:16.200
Pay attention, this part's important.

209
12:16.620 --> 12:18.700
And you can bet it's gonna be on the test.

210
12:18.790 --> 12:20.670
So make sure you remember it.

211
12:35.700 --> 12:37.950
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

212
12:42.580 --> 12:43.640
Hey, Nishikata.

213
12:43.640 --> 12:45.990
I wasn't expecting you. I thought you were out sick.

214
12:46.160 --> 12:47.750
Are you feeling better?

215
12:47.830 --> 12:49.750
Yeah. I think so.

216
12:50.370 --> 12:52.460
Morning. You have a cold?

217
12:54.120 --> 12:54.920
Yeah.

218
12:55.490 --> 12:57.290
But it's nothing.

219
12:57.370 --> 12:58.660
I can handle it.

220
12:58.750 --> 13:00.200
No big deal.

221
13:00.290 --> 13:01.330
Nailed it!

222
13:02.290 --> 13:04.040
Huh?

223
13:04.120 --> 13:08.080
I bet you just stayed up watching <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

224
13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
How did she figure that out?

225
13:12.160 --> 13:13.700
Squeal, squeal!

226
13:13.790 --> 13:16.620
Don't say that so loud, it's embarrassing!

227
13:17.290 --> 13:19.540
Funny, I only heard you screaming.

228
13:19.620 --> 13:21.620
You're right. Sorry, sir!

229
13:23.040 --> 13:25.290
Come on, that was really low, Takagi.

230
13:27.290 --> 13:28.040
You okay?

231
13:28.120 --> 13:29.200
You're coughing.

232
13:29.290 --> 13:31.290
Yeah. It's not that bad.

233
13:33.580 --> 13:34.790
Man.

234
13:34.870 --> 13:38.040
She won't pull any punches even when I'm sick!

235
13:38.120 --> 13:38.560
Heh...

236
13:38.560 --> 13:42.480
But luckily, I have the ultimate
plan to defeat her today!

237
13:43.540 --> 13:46.330
Wait, what's a guy like him doing here?

238
13:46.410 --> 13:47.700
Him and his perfect hair!

239
13:47.790 --> 13:48.910
Now I'm really mad!

240
13:49.000 --> 13:51.290
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

241
13:51.370 --> 13:52.500
Hey!

242
14:02.580 --> 14:03.540
Oh wow.

243
14:03.620 --> 14:04.870
You're so cute.

244
14:06.580 --> 14:08.250
Squeal!

245
14:10.910 --> 14:12.700
I can do that!

246
14:15.290 --> 14:20.180
I may have caught a cold, but it was worth
it for the invaluable knowledge I've gained!

247
14:23.160 --> 14:25.410
Okay, Takagi. Come at me.

248
14:25.500 --> 14:26.450
Gimme your best shot!

249
14:26.540 --> 14:29.000
I'll counter it and make you blush!

250
14:32.120 --> 14:32.620
Ni--

251
14:45.890 --> 14:46.820
Come on!

252
14:46.900 --> 14:48.290
Whenever you're ready!

253
14:50.790 --> 14:52.290
Uh...

254
14:53.950 --> 14:54.830
Uh. What?

255
14:54.910 --> 14:57.330
Don't worry. 'S nothing.

256
15:06.160 --> 15:07.160
Weird.

257
15:07.250 --> 15:09.290
She isn't making her move.

258
15:09.370 --> 15:11.410
I can't stay in this pose forever.

259
15:11.500 --> 15:14.620
And my right hand's on my chin,
so I can't even take notes.

260
15:16.160 --> 15:18.450
Wait, what if she figured it out because of the pose?

261
15:18.540 --> 15:21.570
Is it too obvious I've got a
counter-trap ready to spring on her?

262
15:23.410 --> 15:25.410
One way to find out.

263
15:25.500 --> 15:27.330
Sit normally.

264
15:39.160 --> 15:41.540
What's her deal today?

265
15:41.620 --> 15:43.040
I don't understand!

266
15:43.120 --> 15:46.370
Any other day, she'd have teased me three times by now!

267
15:47.250 --> 15:48.990
Is she sick or something?

268
15:49.370 --> 15:50.680
Huh?

269
15:54.120 --> 15:58.750
When she's quiet, she's really...

270
16:15.370 --> 16:17.250
Uh-oh.

271
16:17.330 --> 16:20.950
I think I'm starting to second guess my plan here.

272
16:20.980 --> 16:24.850
Countering with "You're cute," when she
messes with me might be embarrassing.

273
16:24.870 --> 16:26.540
Duh, of course it is!

274
16:26.620 --> 16:28.980
How did I ever think I'd be able to say that?

275
16:29.330 --> 16:32.200
I bet it's because I'm sick,
and didn't get any sleep last night.

276
16:32.290 --> 16:33.250
Are you okay?

277
16:33.330 --> 16:34.160
Hey.

278
16:34.250 --> 16:36.040
Uh. Yeah.

279
16:36.120 --> 16:37.330
It's all good.

280
16:37.410 --> 16:39.120
Your face is a little red.

281
16:39.200 --> 16:39.830
Huh?

282
16:39.910 --> 16:40.870
And you look tired.

283
16:40.950 --> 16:43.250
Sure you're good?

284
16:43.330 --> 16:45.040
Yes, I'm fine.

285
16:45.120 --> 16:46.580
But you're getting even redder.

286
16:46.660 --> 16:48.120
Do you have a fever?

287
16:48.200 --> 16:50.950
Why are you being so nice to me today, Takagi?

288
16:51.040 --> 16:52.620
How many times do I have to tell you?

289
16:52.620 --> 16:54.040
I'm totally okay!

290
16:54.120 --> 16:54.870
Really?

291
16:54.950 --> 16:56.000
Really!

292
16:56.080 --> 16:57.580
When I said I was feeling sick,

293
16:57.660 --> 16:59.660
it was more like an excuse, anyway.

294
16:59.750 --> 17:02.910
I really just woke up at like,
eight-thirty, so that's why I was late.

295
17:02.910 --> 17:04.790
I'm fine! Promise!

296
17:04.870 --> 17:05.500
Okay.

297
17:05.580 --> 17:07.500
I guess I believe you.

298
17:07.580 --> 17:09.120
It's about time!

299
17:10.910 --> 17:13.160
So... I can tease you again.

300
17:13.250 --> 17:14.950
Huh? What do you mean?

301
17:16.200 --> 17:20.130
And of course, she ended up making
fun of me more than usual that day.

302
17:21.250 --> 17:22.650
Young love!

303
17:23.040 --> 17:24.290
Squeal!

304
17:24.370 --> 17:26.620
Yukari, Sanae, what's with the snail's pace?

305
17:26.700 --> 17:27.950
Power walk, let's go!

306
17:28.040 --> 17:30.660
Why should I exert myself that much for a Popsicle?

307
17:30.750 --> 17:32.870
'Cus, it's the baked sweet potato flavor!

308
17:32.950 --> 17:34.580
It's a summer exclusive!

309
17:34.660 --> 17:36.450
That's a weird flavor for summer.

310
17:36.540 --> 17:38.540
They're sold out of it everywhere that I've looked.

311
17:38.620 --> 17:40.660
But I think this one snack store will have it.

312
17:40.750 --> 17:43.830
So we gotta check before they sell out too!

313
17:46.410 --> 17:47.160
What are you doing?

314
17:47.160 --> 17:50.980
There's no point in taking a shortcut if
you're gonna drag your feet the whole time!

315
17:51.790 --> 17:55.380
I just noticed Takagi and
Nishikata are inside the store.

316
17:55.950 --> 17:58.080
Oh hey. You're right.

317
17:58.160 --> 18:00.620
Could it be that those two are...?

318
18:01.370 --> 18:03.450
Mina, maybe we shouldn't get in their way--

319
18:03.540 --> 18:06.500
Hey! Takagi!

320
18:14.000 --> 18:14.870
Sha-bam!

321
18:14.950 --> 18:16.790
Got my sweet potato pop!

322
18:16.870 --> 18:19.120
Uh. I'm happy for you.

323
18:23.330 --> 18:25.080
See you tomorrow.

324
18:26.580 --> 18:27.840
They're so lucky.

325
18:28.370 --> 18:29.370
Lucky how?

326
18:29.450 --> 18:31.000
Well, look at the two of them.

327
18:31.080 --> 18:32.000
You know.

328
18:32.080 --> 18:33.700
A guy and a girl together.

329
18:33.790 --> 18:35.330
It's just nice.

330
18:37.200 --> 18:38.620
Huh? Why?

331
18:38.700 --> 18:41.600
You didn't notice?

332
18:42.200 --> 18:44.290
Don't blame me, it was your idea.

333
18:50.330 --> 18:52.580
Hey. Why exactly are we following them?

334
18:52.660 --> 18:54.410
We live in the opposite direction.

335
18:54.500 --> 18:55.410
Shhh!

336
18:55.500 --> 18:57.950
They're gonna notice us. Shut up!

337
18:58.040 --> 18:59.410
Just tell me what you think.

338
18:59.500 --> 19:00.750
Don't you feel,

339
19:00.830 --> 19:03.080
I dunno, like something's going on between them?

340
19:03.160 --> 19:04.200
Hmm...

341
19:04.290 --> 19:06.370
Oh! They've got a bike right there!

342
19:06.450 --> 19:08.750
They should be riding it together, right?

343
19:08.830 --> 19:10.870
That is so romantic!

344
19:10.950 --> 19:12.700
Riding home together after school.

345
19:12.790 --> 19:14.710
Oh, but that's a tough decision, because you can

346
19:14.730 --> 19:16.750
spend a lot more time together if you walk instead!

347
19:16.750 --> 19:19.580
Maybe if you trade off every other day?

348
19:19.660 --> 19:21.080
Can I have a bite of that?

349
19:21.160 --> 19:24.370
Uh. Yeah, but just one bite, okay?

350
19:25.750 --> 19:26.700
Hey, Takagi.

351
19:26.790 --> 19:28.450
You wanna race somewhere?

352
19:28.540 --> 19:30.000
Are you challenging me?

353
19:30.080 --> 19:31.040
Uh-huh!

354
19:31.120 --> 19:32.580
We'll start once we turn that corner.

355
19:32.660 --> 19:35.450
The first one to make it all the way to the shrine wins.

356
19:35.540 --> 19:37.790
Hmm. Okay, why not?

357
19:37.870 --> 19:41.000
Haha. She either has to ride her bike or pull it.

358
19:41.080 --> 19:43.160
With that flat tire, she'll lose either way.

359
19:43.250 --> 19:45.450
You have way too wild an imagination!

360
19:45.540 --> 19:48.080
I guarantee you they're not talking about a race!

361
19:48.160 --> 19:50.240
They're talking about something more intimate than that.

362
19:50.240 --> 19:52.000
I just know it!

363
19:58.620 --> 19:59.910
Nishikata.

364
20:00.000 --> 20:02.280
I'm up for us racing to the shrine.

365
20:02.750 --> 20:04.080
But before that...

366
20:04.160 --> 20:05.580
Hmm?

367
20:13.750 --> 20:15.200
They're gone?

368
20:15.290 --> 20:17.370
Did they make it all the way to the shrine already?

369
20:17.450 --> 20:19.000
No way!

370
20:20.080 --> 20:22.370
Maybe they realized we were tailing them.

371
20:22.450 --> 20:25.740
Ugh, come on, let's go home already.

372
20:26.250 --> 20:29.160
Uh. Yeah.

373
20:31.160 --> 20:33.620
I say we buy more popsicles on the way.

374
20:33.700 --> 20:35.160
Will you let me have a bite?

375
20:35.250 --> 20:38.250
Just buy your own if you're gonna keep eating mine!

376
20:44.250 --> 20:46.120
So close.

377
20:52.250 --> 20:53.540
Hmm?

378
20:53.620 --> 20:56.620
Ah. Did we lose them?

379
20:59.410 --> 21:02.500
Any idea why they were following us in the first place?

380
21:02.500 --> 21:04.080
No.

381
21:04.160 --> 21:05.410
Hey, uh...

382
21:05.500 --> 21:08.600
Now that I think about it,
we should have gone around that corner too.

383
21:08.730 --> 21:11.040
It would have been a lot easier to hide over there.

384
21:11.120 --> 21:12.410
Huh.

385
21:12.500 --> 21:14.110
I hadn't thought about that, guess you're right.

386
21:14.790 --> 21:16.660
But I wonder...

387
21:16.750 --> 21:19.120
Would you have preferred if we did?

388
21:21.250 --> 21:22.110
Well, no.

389
21:22.500 --> 21:24.000
It doesn't really matter.

390
21:24.080 --> 21:24.950
Good!

391
21:25.040 --> 21:26.000
I'm glad.

392
21:26.250 --> 21:27.750
Oh, I almost forgot!

393
21:27.830 --> 21:29.570
We're racing to the shrine, yeah?

394
21:29.890 --> 21:32.870
Ready, set go!

395
21:32.950 --> 21:35.500
Huh?! Hey, hold on!

396
21:35.580 --> 21:36.370
I'm calling' you out!

397
21:36.450 --> 21:38.660
That's a false start, Takagi!

398
23:11.540 --> 23:14.650
Tailing those two turned out to be kinda fun in the end.

399
23:15.200 --> 23:17.160
Taking' the long way home.

400
23:17.250 --> 23:19.950
They probably did notice us following them.

401
23:20.040 --> 23:22.290
I better apologize to Takagi tomorrow.

402
23:24.290 --> 23:27.500
They're out of the baked sweet potato flavor!

403
23:28.530 --> 23:29.500
It's okay!

404
23:29.580 --> 23:31.500
They got red bean soup!

405
23:31.580 --> 23:34.500
What is with you wanting these flavors in the summer?

406
23:34.580 --> 23:36.390
So you gonna let me have a bite?

407
01:56.990 --> 02:00.700
<b>"Cleaning Duty"</b>

408
07:15.970 --> 07:19.980
<b>"Kickover"</b>

409
12:09.890 --> 12:13.850
<b>"Cold"</b>

410
18:09.750 --> 18:13.550
<b>"Tailing"</b>
