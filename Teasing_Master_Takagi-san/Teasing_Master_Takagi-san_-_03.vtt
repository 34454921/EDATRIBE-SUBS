00:08.540 --> 00:10.040
Ugh. Bitter.

2
00:10.120 --> 00:11.870
What's going' on with your face?

3
00:11.950 --> 00:13.160
Ugh.

4
00:13.250 --> 00:15.910
Huh? Wait. Isn't that coffee?

5
00:16.000 --> 00:17.830
I thought you hated the stuff, Mina.

6
00:17.910 --> 00:20.330
Why would you buy it you hate it?

7
00:20.410 --> 00:25.370
Well, I'm becoming more of an adult now,
so I thought I should try to get myself used to it.

8
00:25.370 --> 00:26.620
Huh?

9
00:31.870 --> 00:33.910
How exactly are you more of adult now?

10
00:34.000 --> 00:37.950
Ah! Hey, I may not be tall,
but I'm growing in some ways!

11
00:38.040 --> 00:40.450
I'd like to see you drink this, Sanae!

12
00:41.120 --> 00:42.290
No problem.

13
00:42.370 --> 00:43.500
I like it black.

14
00:43.580 --> 00:44.630
Huh?

15
00:46.830 --> 00:49.950
You like it black?

16
00:51.910 --> 00:54.150
Do you wanna trade with me, then?

17
00:55.500 --> 00:57.820
I do. But I'm an adult, so...

18
00:57.840 --> 01:00.870
Three, two, one--

19
01:00.950 --> 01:02.790
Okay, whatever, let's trade!

20
01:02.870 --> 01:04.410
Yes!

21
01:08.450 --> 01:11.250
Ahhh... So good.

22
01:11.330 --> 01:12.950
You sure you're okay with this?

23
01:13.040 --> 01:13.680
Yeah.

24
01:13.680 --> 01:16.120
There's gotta be some adults who can't drink coffee.

25
01:16.200 --> 01:18.080
You know you're a kid right?

26
01:19.080 --> 01:21.370
Why're you so mean?

27
01:21.450 --> 01:22.330
Ahh!

28
01:22.410 --> 01:24.950
Ahhh! Ow!

29
01:27.450 --> 01:29.410
Oh great.

30
01:29.500 --> 01:32.250
Adults don't try to tackle their friends, Mina.

31
03:14.010 --> 03:18.310
As I've come to expect,
Takagi made fun of me a ton today.

32
03:27.080 --> 03:28.780
But I'll get her tomorrow!

33
03:28.820 --> 03:30.620
Nishikata.

34
03:31.910 --> 03:33.500
Takagi!

35
03:34.750 --> 03:36.040
Oh.

36
03:37.000 --> 03:37.950
On your own today?

37
03:38.040 --> 03:38.870
Yeah.

38
03:38.950 --> 03:40.950
Cool. Let's walk home together.

39
03:41.040 --> 03:43.500
Uh. Wait, why?

40
03:44.950 --> 03:45.500
What?

41
03:45.580 --> 03:46.950
Um, sorry.

42
03:46.970 --> 03:48.330
I thought I heard something.

43
03:48.410 --> 03:51.040
But, um, you're on your bike, and all.

44
03:51.120 --> 03:52.700
I'll just push.

45
04:01.580 --> 04:03.950
That's that new drink that just came out, isn't it?

46
04:04.040 --> 04:05.830
Is it good?

47
04:05.910 --> 04:07.410
What is this?

48
04:07.500 --> 04:09.370
Some kind of trap?

49
04:09.450 --> 04:10.830
I like it.

50
04:10.910 --> 04:12.450
You wanna have a sip?

51
04:12.540 --> 04:13.330
Can I?

52
04:13.410 --> 04:15.410
Mm-hmm.

53
04:16.540 --> 04:18.250
Great. Thank you.

54
04:20.160 --> 04:21.580
Not that I really mind,

55
04:21.660 --> 04:26.160
but won't it be like we're
indirectly kissing or something?

56
04:27.830 --> 04:29.000
How's that, Takagi?

57
04:29.080 --> 04:30.420
Super embarrassing, right?

58
04:30.420 --> 04:32.000
You're so embarrassed!

59
04:33.580 --> 04:35.620
Wha...? How?

60
04:35.700 --> 04:38.450
She's not embarrassed in the slightest!

61
04:38.540 --> 04:40.080
What is with her?

62
04:40.160 --> 04:41.330
Ahh...

63
04:41.410 --> 04:42.750
Boy, that was good.

64
04:42.830 --> 04:44.450
Thanks again.

65
04:52.660 --> 04:54.910
Can't drink it?

66
04:55.000 --> 04:57.750
No. Of course I can drink it.

67
04:58.120 --> 04:59.410
It's nothing.

68
04:59.500 --> 05:01.450
No big deal.

69
05:05.290 --> 05:06.790
It's like an indirect kiss.

70
05:06.870 --> 05:08.290
Aah!

71
05:12.580 --> 05:15.330
You're so jumpy.

72
05:16.410 --> 05:20.330
There's gotta be a trash can around here.

73
05:20.410 --> 05:22.950
Man!

74
05:23.040 --> 05:24.120
Wow!

75
05:24.200 --> 05:26.790
That was a pretty good shot, Nishikata.

76
05:26.870 --> 05:28.580
I just threw it without thinking.

77
05:28.660 --> 05:31.000
I didn't expect to make it in.

78
05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
This is crazy!

79
05:42.080 --> 05:44.750
I didn't know I was such a good shot!

80
05:44.830 --> 05:45.790
All right.

81
05:45.870 --> 05:47.910
I wanna give this a go.

82
05:58.250 --> 05:59.830
What are you aiming at?

83
05:59.910 --> 06:01.000
You weren't even close!

84
06:01.080 --> 06:02.500
You're terrible at this!

85
06:02.580 --> 06:05.330
Oh? Care to make it interesting?

86
06:05.410 --> 06:07.290
Yeah, fine.

87
06:07.370 --> 06:09.750
I can't say "no" when winning's a sure-thing.

88
06:09.830 --> 06:12.120
Then, we'll each throw one can at a time.

89
06:12.200 --> 06:14.910
The first person to make it in, wins.

90
06:16.700 --> 06:19.750
Challenging me to a match she can't possibly win.

91
06:19.830 --> 06:22.540
Takagi's really lost her cool this time.

92
06:22.620 --> 06:25.200
And it feels awesome!

93
06:25.290 --> 06:26.620
So if you somehow win,

94
06:26.700 --> 06:29.290
then I guess I'll do anything you want me to.

95
06:29.370 --> 06:31.330
I'm gonna hold you to that.

96
06:31.410 --> 06:33.370
You better not chicken out later.

97
06:33.450 --> 06:34.700
No way.

98
06:34.790 --> 06:37.950
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna lose to you.

99
06:38.040 --> 06:41.000
Glad to hear it.

100
06:50.500 --> 06:53.910
If you miss, that means I win.

101
06:56.040 --> 06:56.830
Ugh.

102
06:56.910 --> 07:00.250
She totally tricked me again.

103
07:01.250 --> 07:04.080
Just stand at the same place and use the same angle.

104
07:06.700 --> 07:07.910
Okay.

105
07:09.290 --> 07:10.450
I can do this.

106
07:10.540 --> 07:12.620
It's a walk in the park!

107
07:12.700 --> 07:13.950
Oh, yeah.

108
07:14.040 --> 07:16.620
So, uh, if you happen to win,

109
07:16.700 --> 07:19.750
then I'll let you have my first kiss.

110
07:32.790 --> 07:34.120
Looks like I win!

111
07:34.200 --> 07:35.620
That wasn't fair.

112
07:35.700 --> 07:37.450
What wasn't?

113
07:37.540 --> 07:38.910
Whaddya mean "what wasn't"?

114
07:39.000 --> 07:40.580
As I threw it, you said--

115
07:40.660 --> 07:42.660
Hmm? Said what?

116
07:42.750 --> 07:44.330
Oh, forget it.

117
07:44.410 --> 07:45.200
Okay.

118
07:45.290 --> 07:46.700
Well, a promise is a promise.

119
07:46.790 --> 07:49.620
Now what should I make you do?

120
07:56.450 --> 07:59.250
I don't even want to think about what she might say.

121
07:59.330 --> 08:01.080
Know what?

122
08:01.160 --> 08:02.620
How about this?

123
08:02.700 --> 08:04.660
You can do whatever.

124
08:07.330 --> 08:10.000
Wait, where are you going Takagi?!

125
08:10.080 --> 08:10.750
Don't pity me!

126
08:10.790 --> 08:12.200
I need consequences!

127
08:12.290 --> 08:13.700
Letting me off like this makes me feel like

128
08:13.700 --> 08:14.870
I'll never beat you at anything.

129
08:14.950 --> 08:16.870
You never will beat me at anything.

130
08:16.950 --> 08:18.700
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

131
08:18.790 --> 08:20.080
Hey!

132
08:25.580 --> 08:27.290
Ahh!

133
08:27.370 --> 08:28.950
So fizzy.

134
08:29.040 --> 08:30.370
What is it this time?

135
08:30.450 --> 08:32.750
Huh? You're drinking soda?

136
08:32.830 --> 08:35.580
I thought you didn't like soda, though.

137
08:37.790 --> 08:40.910
Why do sodas have to be so fizzy? It stings!

138
08:40.910 --> 08:43.870
Is there a reason you keep buying
drinks you don't even like?

139
08:43.870 --> 08:46.040
Pretending to be an adult again?

140
08:46.120 --> 08:47.370
No, not that.

141
08:47.450 --> 08:50.540
I just love the flavor.

142
08:51.830 --> 08:53.580
But it stings bad!

143
08:53.660 --> 08:57.220
My poor tongue is hurting so bad!

144
08:55.870 --> 08:57.120
You're so annoying.

145
08:57.200 --> 08:58.290
What?

146
08:58.370 --> 08:59.370
Don't act like it doesn't hurt your tongue

147
08:59.450 --> 09:00.700
when you have this stuff!

148
09:00.790 --> 09:01.750
It doesn't.

149
09:01.830 --> 09:03.660
Prove it. Have some right now.

150
09:03.750 --> 09:05.620
All right.

151
09:07.290 --> 09:08.330
Ahh!

152
09:08.410 --> 09:10.290
The pain'll bubble up inside you soon.

153
09:10.370 --> 09:12.200
Yeah, not likely.

154
09:19.950 --> 09:20.750
Tell the truth.

155
09:20.830 --> 09:22.250
You're feeling it, aren't you?

156
09:22.330 --> 09:24.000
No, I'm not.

157
09:24.080 --> 09:26.290
Hmm...

158
09:26.370 --> 09:28.000
What pain is she talking about?

159
09:28.080 --> 09:30.370
I'm fine.

160
09:30.450 --> 09:31.540
Oh no.

161
09:31.620 --> 09:33.370
I'm about to burp.

162
09:33.450 --> 09:34.790
Ha! You feeling' it now?

163
09:34.870 --> 09:36.120
Nuh-uh.

164
09:36.200 --> 09:39.870
If I burp right now, she's gonna make fun of me.

165
09:44.200 --> 09:46.750
But this stupid fizz is still coming up.

166
09:46.830 --> 09:51.250
I can't hold it much longer!

167
09:53.830 --> 09:56.410
Agh! It's so tingly, I hate it!

168
09:56.500 --> 09:58.160
Ahhh...

169
10:01.370 --> 10:02.660
What's your problem?

170
10:02.750 --> 10:04.290
Nothing.

171
10:05.830 --> 10:10.120
Why am I still drinking this?

172
10:11.330 --> 10:13.950
See you tomorrow!

173
10:18.700 --> 10:22.080
Just you wait, Takagi.

174
10:22.160 --> 10:26.020
Including the walk home,
she teased me 15 times in total today.

175
10:29.540 --> 10:33.000
Each time I make a mistake during a
game, I make a note of it.

176
10:33.000 --> 10:35.700
Then I train ten times harder for each one.

177
10:35.790 --> 10:38.610
I believe that will lead me to my next victory.

178
10:39.260 --> 10:40.830
That's it!

179
10:40.910 --> 10:43.200
Today I had 15 losses.

180
10:43.290 --> 10:46.370
And that times ten is 150!

181
10:46.450 --> 10:49.700
Uh... That might be too much for my first go.

182
10:49.790 --> 10:50.700
Okay.

183
10:50.790 --> 10:52.560
Let's try three times first.

184
10:54.120 --> 10:57.790
One, two, three.

185
11:01.700 --> 11:04.040
Eighteen.

186
11:04.120 --> 11:05.750
Nineteen.

187
11:10.830 --> 11:13.040
This is a lot harder than I thought!

188
11:13.120 --> 11:15.120
Maybe I shouldn't do so many.

189
11:15.200 --> 11:16.450
No, I have to!

190
11:16.540 --> 11:20.380
This is my punishment for letting
Takagi mess with me so many times!

191
11:22.330 --> 11:28.480
I'll savor this agony and use it as
motivation to get back at her next time!

192
11:29.290 --> 11:31.120
I can do this!

193
11:38.330 --> 11:39.200
What's wrong?

194
11:39.290 --> 11:40.450
Is your arm hurt?

195
11:40.540 --> 11:41.500
Pull a muscle?

196
11:41.580 --> 11:43.290
Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

197
11:43.370 --> 11:45.500
It's just extra sore is all.

198
11:45.580 --> 11:46.870
Huh?

199
11:49.500 --> 11:50.870
I just said it was sore!

200
11:50.950 --> 11:52.910
That really hurts!

201
11:53.000 --> 11:55.660
Does that count as her first teasing of the day?

202
11:55.750 --> 11:58.580
I should probably be holding myself accountable.

203
11:58.660 --> 12:00.410
So I guess that's one.

204
12:01.750 --> 12:02.910
Hey!

205
12:04.500 --> 12:06.040
That was way too easy!

206
12:06.120 --> 12:09.040
You must be really sore if flinching hurts.

207
12:09.120 --> 12:12.340
Okay, well that was definitely
teasing, no doubt about it.

208
12:12.870 --> 12:15.790
So... wanna tell me why you're sore all of a sudden?

209
12:15.870 --> 12:18.790
Uhh. I started to work out yesterday, so you know.

210
12:18.870 --> 12:20.040
Interesting.

211
12:20.120 --> 12:23.040
I hope you don't quit after like, three days.

212
12:23.120 --> 12:24.540
Hah. Go ahead.

213
12:24.620 --> 12:26.750
Laugh it up now.

214
12:29.500 --> 12:30.450
Why?

215
12:30.540 --> 12:32.580
She teased me 23 times today!

216
12:32.580 --> 12:34.080
Is that a record?

217
12:34.160 --> 12:37.160
Either way, it's much more than yesterday!

218
12:38.910 --> 12:43.120
One, two, three.

219
12:44.500 --> 12:47.200
Hey, whatever happened to working out, Nishikata?

220
12:47.290 --> 12:49.000
Nothing, I still do it daily.

221
12:49.080 --> 12:50.290
Oh wow.

222
12:50.370 --> 12:52.080
So you didn't quit three days in?

223
12:52.160 --> 12:54.620
Yes, thanks to you.

224
12:54.700 --> 12:56.450
Oh! But you know what I heard?

225
12:56.540 --> 12:58.000
Huh? No, what?

226
12:58.080 --> 13:02.790
They say if you work out too much during your
growth spurt, it'll stop you from getting taller.

227
13:02.790 --> 13:04.290
Uh, wait?

228
13:04.370 --> 13:06.580
Huh?! Oh no!

229
13:06.660 --> 13:08.700
I think I did hear that somewhere before!

230
13:08.790 --> 13:10.120
That's not good!

231
13:10.200 --> 13:12.000
If she ends ups taller than me because I'm stunting

232
13:12.000 --> 13:13.750
my own growth, I'll never heard the end of it!

233
13:13.750 --> 13:15.200
She'll make fun of me forever!

234
13:15.290 --> 13:18.580
What do I do, what do I do?

235
13:18.660 --> 13:21.160
But that is just a rumor.

236
13:21.250 --> 13:23.040
Just a rumor?

237
13:23.120 --> 13:28.200
In fact, I've also heard moderate
exercise actually supports your growth.

238
13:28.200 --> 13:31.000
So, that being the case, you should keep working out.

239
13:31.080 --> 13:32.870
Nothing to worry about.

240
13:32.950 --> 13:34.290
It's a good idea.

241
13:34.370 --> 13:35.410
And to be honest,

242
13:35.500 --> 13:37.870
you kinda look a bit more muscular.

243
13:39.160 --> 13:40.450
You think?

244
13:44.830 --> 13:45.870
What's wrong?

245
13:45.950 --> 13:47.580
You're quiet.

246
13:49.290 --> 13:51.160
Don't tell me that you're blushing.

247
13:51.250 --> 13:53.870
I'm not blushing.

248
13:53.950 --> 13:55.950
But your face is red.

249
13:57.250 --> 13:59.700
Yeah, you're definitely blushing all right.

250
13:59.790 --> 14:02.450
Why do you always have to tease me every single day?

251
14:02.540 --> 14:05.370
Because I like seeing your reactions, duh.

252
14:05.450 --> 14:06.660
By the way,

253
14:06.750 --> 14:09.700
I wasn't lying when I said you look muscular.

254
14:09.790 --> 14:12.830
Honestly, you've looked pretty good lately.

255
14:14.750 --> 14:16.120
You're even redder now!

256
14:16.200 --> 14:18.830
Whatever! It's just because it's hot outside!

257
14:18.910 --> 14:19.580
Hey!

258
14:19.660 --> 14:20.500
Takagi!

259
14:20.580 --> 14:21.950
Come back!

260
14:22.040 --> 14:24.330
The count is 54 today.

261
14:24.410 --> 14:27.250
Oh, 55 including this last one.

262
14:27.330 --> 14:29.700
But I'm starting to think that I should keep working out

263
14:29.790 --> 14:32.500
even if Takagi doesn't tease me.

264
14:38.000 --> 14:40.540
Chester dear, are you eating dinner at home tonight?

265
14:40.620 --> 14:42.910
Well, I reckon' that depends on work.

266
14:43.000 --> 14:46.370
If we go too late,
I'll just eat with Jirou on my way home.

267
14:46.450 --> 14:48.500
I'm glad you've found a close friend in Jirou,

268
14:48.500 --> 14:51.200
but you should have dinner at home sometimes.

269
14:51.290 --> 14:53.290
It's starting to feel lonely without you.

270
14:53.370 --> 14:56.410
Yeah, but it's mah job, what can yah do?

271
14:57.830 --> 14:59.580
Can we please just go home?

272
14:59.660 --> 15:01.620
No way! We're having' fun!

273
15:01.700 --> 15:04.080
Why are you still talking like that?

274
15:04.160 --> 15:05.160
So annoying.

275
15:05.250 --> 15:06.000
Uh...

276
15:06.080 --> 15:07.040
You jerk!

277
15:07.120 --> 15:09.700
Am I really so unimportant to you?

278
15:09.790 --> 15:12.200
Aww, Pudding', don't be like that.

279
15:12.290 --> 15:13.330
I'm doing' mah best here.

280
15:15.620 --> 15:17.500
Why are you crying' mah darling'?

281
15:17.580 --> 15:21.540
Well, it's as if Jirou and your
work have taken you away from me.

282
15:21.540 --> 15:22.280
I just...

283
15:22.280 --> 15:24.660
I don't think I can take it any longer.

284
15:24.750 --> 15:26.830
Emotions are running high.

285
15:26.910 --> 15:29.200
Ahh jeez, I'm sick o' this!

286
15:29.290 --> 15:32.370
How could you say such a thing, Chester? Oh!

287
15:32.450 --> 15:33.370
Listen here.

288
15:33.450 --> 15:35.000
If yer gonna act like this.

289
15:35.080 --> 15:37.410
Then so will I!

290
15:37.500 --> 15:40.500
Uh... Hold on.

291
15:40.580 --> 15:43.870
Did you realize those cats are both male?

292
15:45.200 --> 15:48.790
Hey, whaddya know, it's Chester!

293
15:48.870 --> 15:50.450
Well, if it ain't Jirou!

294
15:50.540 --> 15:52.330
Wanna grab a bite to eat?

295
15:52.410 --> 15:54.910
I really want to go home.

296
16:06.750 --> 16:10.250
Aww! Of course it starts raining right when school ends.

297
16:10.330 --> 16:13.000
Huh?! No one told me it was gonna rain today!

298
16:13.080 --> 16:15.410
If I knew, I would have brought my raincoat!

299
16:15.500 --> 16:17.660
Dummy.

300
16:17.750 --> 16:20.330
Hey, don't be so mean to Mina.

301
16:21.160 --> 16:22.870
You want to take the bus home, then?

302
16:22.950 --> 16:25.250
I don't have any bus money either.

303
16:25.330 --> 16:27.040
See what I mean, dumb.

304
16:27.120 --> 16:28.660
Oh, you be quiet.

305
16:28.750 --> 16:30.770
I'll lend you some cash, don't worry.

306
16:32.050 --> 16:33.330
Man.

307
16:33.410 --> 16:36.120
I got teased a ton today, too.

308
16:37.750 --> 16:40.620
Huh? Aren't you heading home, Takagi?

309
16:40.700 --> 16:41.790
Not yet.

310
16:41.870 --> 16:44.830
I didn't bring a raincoat or an umbrella.

311
16:48.580 --> 16:50.120
You are such an airhead!

312
16:50.200 --> 16:52.450
You really didn't know it was gonna rain today?

313
16:52.540 --> 16:54.790
How ditzy can you be?

314
16:58.870 --> 17:00.000
No comeback?

315
17:00.080 --> 17:01.500
Oh.

316
17:01.580 --> 17:04.450
Come to think of it, your umbrella is pretty big, right?

317
17:04.540 --> 17:05.790
Huh?

318
17:09.910 --> 17:12.790
We look like a couple under this umbrella together.

319
17:12.790 --> 17:15.120
How in the world did this happen?

320
17:15.390 --> 17:16.700
I feel so weird!

321
17:16.790 --> 17:18.580
It's super awkward!

322
17:18.660 --> 17:20.080
What should I do?

323
17:20.160 --> 17:22.700
Fill the silence, I guess.

324
17:22.790 --> 17:25.540
So, uh, what about your bike?

325
17:25.620 --> 17:28.290
It's still at school, but I'll walk tomorrow.

326
17:28.370 --> 17:30.450
Oh. Okay.

327
17:32.290 --> 17:36.870
It's even more awkward now that I tried to fill
the silence, and it worked for all of five seconds!

328
17:36.870 --> 17:40.040
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed that
it's getting hard to breathe.

329
17:40.120 --> 17:42.750
I need to distract myself somehow.

330
17:48.750 --> 17:50.410
Hey, Takagi!

331
17:52.330 --> 17:53.660
How's this?

332
17:53.750 --> 17:54.660
Are you scared?

333
17:54.750 --> 17:55.290
Surprised?

334
17:55.370 --> 17:59.330
Give me something!

335
17:59.410 --> 18:01.040
Aww. He's so cute!

336
18:01.120 --> 18:02.830
Excuse me?

337
18:02.910 --> 18:04.700
Ugh, what was I thinking?

338
18:04.790 --> 18:08.330
This is Takagi I'm dealing with, of course she's fine!

339
18:08.410 --> 18:10.000
Wait, what?

340
18:14.200 --> 18:16.080
Don't freak, it's just a frog.

341
18:24.370 --> 18:25.950
By the way, Nishikata.

342
18:26.040 --> 18:27.950
Is your shoulder getting wet over there?

343
18:28.040 --> 18:29.080
Yeah, sort of.

344
18:29.160 --> 18:30.660
It's not that bad, though.

345
18:30.750 --> 18:32.910
Getting wet at all can lead to a cold.

346
18:32.960 --> 18:36.000
I'm gonna scoot closer,
so get yourself all the way under the umbrella.

347
18:44.330 --> 18:47.450
My heart's pounding so fast.

348
18:47.540 --> 18:50.370
It feels like it's about to burst!

349
18:50.450 --> 18:52.910
Calm down, calm down, Nishikata!

350
18:53.000 --> 18:57.750
If she finds out you're nervous,
she's gonna make fun of you again!

351
18:57.750 --> 18:59.410
Just talk about something.

352
18:59.500 --> 19:00.790
Anything!

353
19:00.870 --> 19:02.290
So hey, uh...

354
19:02.370 --> 19:03.660
Hmm?

355
19:03.750 --> 19:08.430
It's pretty unusual for you to forget
your umbrella when it's supposed to rain.

356
19:08.700 --> 19:12.230
Could it be that you really are an
airhead, and I was right all along?

357
19:14.370 --> 19:16.500
Was that too harsh?

358
19:16.580 --> 19:19.370
Hmmm...

359
19:19.450 --> 19:20.750
Yeah, maybe.

360
19:20.830 --> 19:23.790
I do tend to be sort of forgetful.

361
19:25.620 --> 19:27.040
Did I hear that right?

362
19:27.120 --> 19:29.500
Did she just admit she has a fault?

363
19:29.580 --> 19:31.540
What a rare occasion!

364
19:31.620 --> 19:34.540
I feel like I've won for once!

365
19:34.620 --> 19:38.200
I'm having trouble remembering
something right now, actually.

366
19:38.290 --> 19:39.290
Oh, yeah?

367
19:39.370 --> 19:40.660
Do you need help?

368
19:40.750 --> 19:41.370
Mm-hmm.

369
19:41.370 --> 19:44.120
The two of us, all close, sharing the same umbrella.

370
19:44.200 --> 19:45.950
We must look like a...

371
19:46.040 --> 19:48.410
What was the word for it?

372
19:49.410 --> 19:51.700
I just can't seem to remember it.

373
19:51.790 --> 19:52.660
Uhh.

374
19:52.750 --> 19:54.700
Wait, you don't mean...

375
19:54.790 --> 19:57.290
It's on the tip of my tongue!

376
19:57.370 --> 19:59.620
Uh... We look like a couple?

377
19:59.700 --> 20:02.580
Huh? What was that?

378
20:02.660 --> 20:05.370
I didn't quite hear you.

379
20:08.370 --> 20:10.750
Oh, I remember!

380
20:10.830 --> 20:12.250
It was "couple"!

381
20:12.330 --> 20:14.830
Come on, there's no way you forgot that!

382
20:14.910 --> 20:18.700
Oh, what about that thing that couples do?

383
20:18.790 --> 20:19.830
You know.

384
20:19.910 --> 20:21.910
It's a way they express their love.

385
20:21.960 --> 20:24.690
When they take their lips and then
press them up against each other?

386
20:26.330 --> 20:28.700
If I don't answer her, then I lose!

387
20:29.290 --> 20:31.200
A... A kiss?

388
20:31.290 --> 20:34.160
Huh? I can't hear you, the rain's too loud.

389
20:34.250 --> 20:35.160
What do you mean?

390
20:35.250 --> 20:37.080
It's not raining that hard anymore.

391
20:37.160 --> 20:38.120
Hmm?

392
20:38.200 --> 20:40.660
So don't pretend you didn't hear me.

393
20:40.750 --> 20:42.330
I said it's a kiss.

394
20:42.410 --> 20:44.250
Ahh. That was it.

395
20:44.330 --> 20:48.580
So how about that phrase they
always use to show their feelings?

396
20:48.580 --> 20:50.330
Know that?

397
20:50.410 --> 20:51.160
You know.

398
20:51.250 --> 20:52.040
That one.

399
20:52.120 --> 20:54.790
Not I "like" you, but...

400
20:55.250 --> 20:56.790
Pretty sure it starts out the same.

401
20:56.870 --> 20:58.620
"I" something.

402
20:58.700 --> 21:00.660
Uh, I dunno.

403
21:00.750 --> 21:03.330
I think the next word starts with "L" too.

404
21:03.410 --> 21:05.250
I said I don't know!

405
21:05.330 --> 21:08.450
Nah, you know this one.

406
21:08.540 --> 21:10.040
"I"...

407
21:10.120 --> 21:12.700
The next word starts with "L-O."

408
21:15.870 --> 21:20.160
"I lo"... What's the next letter?

409
21:20.250 --> 21:21.700
You know it.

410
21:21.790 --> 21:23.290
Th-That's enough.

411
21:23.370 --> 21:25.250
Oh! The last word is "you."

412
21:25.330 --> 21:28.080
You're not gonna let up, are you?

413
21:28.160 --> 21:30.410
Ugh, man!

414
21:40.120 --> 21:41.620
Hey, check it out, the rain stopped!

415
21:41.700 --> 21:43.230
Yeah, you're right.

416
21:43.230 --> 21:45.000
I'm saved!

417
21:45.080 --> 21:49.830
There was no way I could survive that
treatment until we reached her house!

418
21:49.830 --> 21:51.620
Well, my place is this way.

419
21:51.700 --> 21:54.500
Now that the skies are clear, I'll be going.

420
21:56.500 --> 21:57.830
Where are we?

421
21:57.910 --> 22:00.330
I don't know how to get home from here.

422
22:00.410 --> 22:01.410
Ugh!

423
22:01.500 --> 22:03.370
Will you ever give me a break?
