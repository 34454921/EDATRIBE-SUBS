1
00:02.580 --> 00:04.410
Forget the test!

2
00:04.500 --> 00:07.160
I'm gonna die if I have to study any longer!

3
00:07.250 --> 00:08.540
I'm hitting' the arcade.

4
00:08.620 --> 00:10.330
Well, we can't let you go alone!

5
00:10.410 --> 00:12.500
Hey, Nishikata, are you coming'?

6
00:12.580 --> 00:13.910
I don't know about you,

7
00:14.000 --> 00:15.700
but when I study for too long, it just doesn't stick.

8
00:15.790 --> 00:16.580
Uhh.

9
00:16.660 --> 00:18.080
Sorry, I think I'm gonna stay.

10
00:18.160 --> 00:19.700
You've made your choice!

11
00:20.620 --> 00:22.080
Later!

12
00:23.080 --> 00:24.450
What are you guys gonna play?

13
00:24.540 --> 00:26.660
Whichever gets me one of those cute figures.

14
00:26.750 --> 00:27.620
Man.

15
00:27.650 --> 00:28.620
I'm jealous.

16
00:28.700 --> 00:30.700
But I can't think about them.

17
00:30.790 --> 00:33.040
I have to get a good grade on my next test!

18
00:33.120 --> 00:34.120
Or else!

19
00:34.200 --> 00:35.700
Hey.

20
00:35.790 --> 00:37.950
Can I sit here?

21
00:41.500 --> 00:43.080
Studying for the test?

22
00:43.160 --> 00:44.540
Yeah. I am.

23
02:19.330 --> 02:22.830
I just saw your friends leaving as I came in.

24
02:22.910 --> 02:24.040
Yeah.

25
02:24.120 --> 02:26.450
We were all studying together for a while.

26
02:27.450 --> 02:28.910
Ahh...

27
02:29.000 --> 02:30.290
Well I heard them talking,

28
02:30.370 --> 02:32.750
and I figured they were on their way to the arcade.

29
02:32.830 --> 02:34.910
Are you not going with them?

30
02:35.000 --> 02:37.650
I don't have time to play around like they do.

31
02:38.660 --> 02:42.450
If I don't score within the top
fifty of my grade on this test.

32
02:42.540 --> 02:45.250
My parents are taking away my video games.

33
02:45.330 --> 02:47.200
Huuuh.

34
02:47.290 --> 02:48.950
I see.

35
02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
Oh, no!

36
02:52.250 --> 02:53.870
Why am I telling her everything?

37
02:53.950 --> 02:56.770
Now that she knows, she's totally
gonna distract me from studying!

38
02:57.040 --> 02:58.450
Nice going, me.

39
03:02.370 --> 03:05.950
I.. was just kidding?

40
03:06.040 --> 03:07.620
About what?

41
03:07.700 --> 03:09.650
Ugh. Forget it.

42
03:10.410 --> 03:12.300
Anyway, don't interrupt me this time.

43
03:12.830 --> 03:14.080
That's mean.

44
03:14.160 --> 03:16.250
You say that like I'm always getting in your way.

45
03:16.330 --> 03:18.370
That's because you are!

46
03:18.450 --> 03:23.500
Well, yeah. It's 'cuz it's so
fun to tease you, Nishikata!

47
03:24.540 --> 03:26.410
Should I study somewhere else?

48
03:26.500 --> 03:29.120
No, if I did that, I'd basically be letting her win.

49
03:32.830 --> 03:34.040
I just realized.

50
03:34.120 --> 03:35.280
You're not studying?

51
03:35.660 --> 03:36.510
Nope.

52
03:36.510 --> 03:39.700
I like to limit myself to two hours of studying a day.

53
03:39.790 --> 03:40.870
Oh.

54
03:42.040 --> 03:43.830
I shouldn't be surprised.

55
03:43.910 --> 03:47.540
She easily scores in the top
ten of our grade all the time.

56
03:47.620 --> 03:51.370
But, what does she have up her sleeve?

57
03:51.450 --> 03:53.200
This is Takagi we're talking about.

58
03:53.290 --> 03:55.350
She's definitely gonna try to mess with me.

59
03:55.680 --> 03:57.330
I mean, how could she not?

60
03:57.410 --> 03:59.750
It's practically in her blood!

61
03:59.830 --> 04:00.830
Hmm? What's up?

62
04:00.830 --> 04:03.250
Huh? Oh, nothing, just thinking.

63
04:03.330 --> 04:05.200
It's not like I was looking at you.

64
04:05.290 --> 04:06.940
I just kinda spaced out--

65
04:06.330 --> 04:08.590
By the way, you got that one wrong.

66
04:09.370 --> 04:14.450
Problem six, where it says, "Solve for x
over negative two plus three y." That one.

67
04:15.250 --> 04:16.750
You mean it's not 15?

68
04:16.830 --> 04:17.870
Mm-hmm.

69
04:17.950 --> 04:19.080
What? Really?

70
04:19.160 --> 04:21.040
Mm-hmm.

71
04:21.870 --> 04:23.410
Substitute the numbers.

72
04:23.500 --> 04:24.580
Was that wrong?

73
04:24.660 --> 04:26.790
No. So then...

74
04:30.620 --> 04:32.330
Here we go.

75
04:32.410 --> 04:35.080
Uh... What are you...?

76
04:38.290 --> 04:40.260
It's easier to teach you this way.

77
04:40.870 --> 04:43.120
So, x equals negative 16...

78
04:43.200 --> 04:44.290
"Easier to."

79
04:44.370 --> 04:46.370
She's teaching me?

80
04:46.450 --> 04:48.500
What is she planning?

81
04:48.580 --> 04:50.450
Write it out. Go ahead.

82
04:51.910 --> 04:55.450
There's a negative times a negative
and don't forget order of operations.

83
04:55.450 --> 04:57.000
It's "PEMDAS" remember?

84
04:57.080 --> 04:58.120
Oh yeah!

85
04:58.200 --> 04:59.250
Then let's see.

86
05:00.700 --> 05:01.580
It's five!

87
05:01.660 --> 05:03.200
Yep. That's right!

88
05:03.290 --> 05:05.000
Oh! And for these next ones, you should be able...

89
05:05.080 --> 05:06.370
She's amazing.

90
05:06.450 --> 05:09.000
She can figure it out with just a glance.

91
05:09.080 --> 05:10.790
Hey. I appreciate this.

92
05:10.870 --> 05:13.410
I was really struggling with this page before.

93
05:14.080 --> 05:16.290
Why don't I teach you from the beginning?

94
05:17.830 --> 05:19.950
She's gonna teach me the whole thing?

95
05:20.040 --> 05:22.330
I'm saved!

96
05:22.410 --> 05:24.620
No, something's fishy here!

97
05:24.700 --> 05:25.870
Why is she being so nice?

98
05:25.950 --> 05:28.730
She's never this nice unless she's teasing me!

99
05:29.160 --> 05:30.870
Hey, Takagi.

100
05:30.950 --> 05:33.790
Why are you being so nice to me today?

101
05:33.870 --> 05:34.540
Hmm?

102
05:34.620 --> 05:36.120
What do you mean?

103
05:36.200 --> 05:39.750
Well, you're just being kinder than usual.

104
05:39.830 --> 05:40.950
So...

105
05:41.040 --> 05:43.370
Oh... Right.

106
05:43.450 --> 05:46.700
I am always teasing you in the middle of class.

107
05:46.790 --> 05:51.080
I would feel really bad if your
grades went down because of me.

108
05:52.080 --> 05:54.620
Nishikata.

109
05:54.700 --> 05:57.160
I'm sorry for teasing you every single day.

110
05:57.250 --> 05:59.830
Let me help you get a better grade.

111
06:00.910 --> 06:02.500
Takagi.

112
06:03.540 --> 06:05.000
I don't believe it.

113
06:05.080 --> 06:08.200
You've finally seen the error in your ways!

114
06:08.290 --> 06:11.120
All right, let's go for it!

115
06:13.250 --> 06:14.540
Thanks for the juice.

116
06:14.620 --> 06:16.120
No, thank you.

117
06:16.200 --> 06:19.010
I made huge progress on my math
today, because I had your help.

118
06:19.970 --> 06:23.020
Now I'm less likely to have my games taken away.

119
06:25.040 --> 06:28.300
Maybe Takagi is actually a good person, after all.

120
06:29.410 --> 06:30.160
Really.

121
06:30.250 --> 06:31.700
Thank you so much for today.

122
06:31.790 --> 06:32.700
Oh, no.

123
06:32.790 --> 06:35.040
You shouldn't thank me.

124
06:35.120 --> 06:40.080
Since what I taught you, won't be on the test.

125
06:44.500 --> 06:46.790
Wha... Hey! Hold on!

126
06:46.870 --> 06:48.870
You're good at substitution now, right?

127
06:48.950 --> 06:50.370
Yeah, and a lot of good that'll do!

128
06:50.450 --> 06:52.160
Gimme back that juice right now!

129
06:52.250 --> 06:53.370
Oops, I already opened it.

130
06:53.450 --> 06:55.080
You literally just opened it!

131
06:58.330 --> 07:00.790
Pass your answer sheets forward.

132
07:03.580 --> 07:05.040
I think I did pretty well.

133
07:05.120 --> 07:07.540
I should've gotten a 90 at least.

134
07:09.080 --> 07:10.160
Hey, Yukari?

135
07:10.250 --> 07:12.120
Can you teach me this?

136
07:12.200 --> 07:14.450
I just can't seem to do well in English.

137
07:14.540 --> 07:17.800
Huh? You make it sound like
you're good at everything else.

138
07:18.700 --> 07:20.700
No, I'm just extra bad at English!

139
07:20.790 --> 07:21.620
Anyway!

140
07:21.700 --> 07:22.580
Help me out here!

141
07:22.660 --> 07:24.040
In this part--

142
07:25.620 --> 07:26.790
Sorry, no can do.

143
07:26.870 --> 07:28.830
I want to review before the next test, too.

144
07:28.910 --> 07:31.910
Huh?! But you always help me study between tests!

145
07:32.000 --> 07:33.410
This time is different.

146
07:33.500 --> 07:37.990
If I can get a 90 or above on everything,
my parents are buying me any game I want.

147
07:39.950 --> 07:42.290
Cool. So this part's been really tripping me up.

148
07:42.290 --> 07:43.870
Were you listening?

149
07:43.950 --> 07:46.750
I don't have the time to teach
you guys this stuff last minute.

150
07:46.750 --> 07:47.250
Meanie!

151
07:47.330 --> 07:48.500
Buzz off. Shoo.

152
07:48.580 --> 07:49.540
What's more important?

153
07:49.620 --> 07:51.540
Our friendship or some stupid game?

154
07:51.620 --> 07:52.700
Yeah, what she said.

155
07:52.790 --> 07:54.290
Sure you can play video games,

156
07:54.370 --> 07:56.500
but you can't teach them like you can your best friends!

157
07:56.580 --> 07:58.080
Yeah, what she said.

158
08:00.290 --> 08:04.310
Now that those two academic train wrecks
will leave me alone, I should review.

159
08:05.370 --> 08:07.790
All right, I'm handing out the next test.

160
08:07.870 --> 08:09.580
Take one and pass it back.

161
08:09.660 --> 08:13.370
Okay, I've thoroughly reviewed the
material right before the test.

162
08:13.370 --> 08:16.770
Now that I've got English fresh in the
brain, this'll be a--

163
08:17.580 --> 08:19.040
Math?

164
08:24.750 --> 08:25.580
Here.

165
08:25.660 --> 08:28.140
Did you study at all this time?

166
08:28.540 --> 08:29.290
Next.

167
08:29.370 --> 08:30.830
Saitou.

168
08:30.910 --> 08:32.950
You're looking nervous over there.

169
08:33.040 --> 08:33.870
No, I'm not.

170
08:33.950 --> 08:35.200
Takagi.

171
08:35.290 --> 08:36.950
Yes!

172
08:39.410 --> 08:41.600
You did very well, as usual.

173
08:41.950 --> 08:44.290
She's so smart.

174
08:44.370 --> 08:47.120
Sounds like you did fine Takagi.

175
08:47.200 --> 08:48.700
Can we compare answers later?

176
08:48.790 --> 08:49.830
Sure.

177
08:49.910 --> 08:50.540
So.

178
08:50.620 --> 08:52.950
You get a good grade?

179
08:53.040 --> 08:54.790
Yeah, but not a hundred percent.

180
08:54.870 --> 08:56.450
That sounds about right.

181
08:56.540 --> 08:58.520
But I got this one in the bag, too.

182
08:58.520 --> 08:59.950
Next up, Nishikata!

183
09:00.040 --> 09:01.450
Right!

184
09:03.040 --> 09:05.450
You can do a little better next time.

185
09:09.040 --> 09:10.700
Was it that bad?

186
09:10.790 --> 09:12.330
As if you care at all!

187
09:12.410 --> 09:14.540
You're the one who taught me
stuff that wasn't on the test!

188
09:14.620 --> 09:16.580
All up on your high horse because you got a good score!

189
09:16.660 --> 09:17.450
Whatever!

190
09:17.540 --> 09:19.680
Hey. Hey!

191
09:20.370 --> 09:21.540
Guess my score.

192
09:21.620 --> 09:23.250
And I'll guess yours.

193
09:23.330 --> 09:25.290
Whoever gets closer will win.

194
09:25.370 --> 09:28.080
You're always proposing this stuff out of nowhere.

195
09:28.160 --> 09:29.790
But okay.

196
09:29.870 --> 09:32.870
Uh... Is it around 50?

197
09:32.950 --> 09:33.620
Hmph!

198
09:33.630 --> 09:35.800
You underestimate me too much, Takagi.

199
09:36.120 --> 09:37.260
You think so?

200
09:37.790 --> 09:41.260
Okay, then did you get above 60 percent?

201
09:43.370 --> 09:45.120
I'll take that as a no.

202
09:45.200 --> 09:46.700
How did she know?

203
09:46.790 --> 09:48.250
Give her your poker face.

204
09:48.260 --> 09:51.330
Confuse her with your world
class, unwavering poker face!

205
09:51.410 --> 09:53.830
Did you get above 55?

206
09:56.290 --> 09:57.620
That's a yes.

207
09:57.650 --> 09:59.160
Why?

208
09:59.250 --> 10:02.580
That leaves everything between 55 and 59.

209
10:02.660 --> 10:05.630
I have to keep her from guessing the exact score!

210
10:05.910 --> 10:08.410
Okay, then.

211
10:08.500 --> 10:10.080
Fifty-six?

212
10:10.160 --> 10:11.620
Or...

213
10:11.700 --> 10:14.120
Fifty-seven?

214
10:14.200 --> 10:15.810
Fifty-eight?

215
10:16.620 --> 10:19.120
Fifty-nine?

216
10:19.200 --> 10:20.750
Yup.

217
10:20.830 --> 10:22.830
I got it.

218
10:22.910 --> 10:24.750
You got a 56.

219
10:24.830 --> 10:27.500
Uhh. Is that the answer you're going with?

220
10:27.580 --> 10:30.160
Mm-hmm.

221
10:30.250 --> 10:32.200
Ready to know the truth?

222
10:33.950 --> 10:35.700
I got a 59!

223
10:35.790 --> 10:36.910
Sucks to be you!

224
10:37.000 --> 10:39.040
I guess you were sorta close, though.

225
10:39.790 --> 10:40.870
Hey, quiet down.

226
10:40.950 --> 10:43.000
The only thing that sucks is your grade.

227
10:43.080 --> 10:44.660
You're right; I'm sorry.

228
10:48.120 --> 10:49.290
Fifty-nine, huh?

229
10:49.370 --> 10:52.200
Looks like I was off by three.

230
10:53.040 --> 10:54.290
All right.

231
10:54.370 --> 10:56.540
Now it's your turn to try and guess my score okay?

232
10:56.620 --> 10:58.160
If it's within two percent.

233
10:58.250 --> 10:59.830
Then you're the winner.

234
10:59.910 --> 11:01.080
Bring it on!

235
11:01.160 --> 11:03.500
I'm gonna figure it out based on her reactions.

236
11:03.580 --> 11:05.160
The teacher praised her a second ago,

237
11:05.250 --> 11:08.870
so I bet that means she got above a 90.

238
11:08.950 --> 11:11.450
Is it... like, a 92?

239
11:11.540 --> 11:12.830
Uh...

240
11:12.910 --> 11:13.830
Huh?

241
11:13.910 --> 11:16.660
What kinda reaction was that?

242
11:16.750 --> 11:20.410
How about a 95?

243
11:20.500 --> 11:22.080
Ninety?

244
11:23.790 --> 11:25.540
Or was it 92?

245
11:25.620 --> 11:27.250
Uh...

246
11:30.000 --> 11:31.580
She is so faking it!

247
11:31.660 --> 11:33.020
I'm not gonna fall for that!

248
11:33.020 --> 11:35.580
She'd never make her reaction so obvious!

249
11:35.660 --> 11:36.950
She's mocking me.

250
11:37.040 --> 11:40.020
I'm gonna do everything within my power to win this!

251
11:40.950 --> 11:43.520
Maybe if I focus more on her expression.

252
11:46.080 --> 11:47.930
What? What's wrong?

253
11:48.910 --> 11:51.000
Hmm? Oh, nothing.

254
11:51.080 --> 11:53.010
I was just thinking about something.

255
11:53.580 --> 11:56.730
We've been staring at each other for a long time.

256
12:01.160 --> 12:02.540
Why are you turning away?

257
12:02.620 --> 12:04.580
Aww come on, that was a cheap shot!

258
12:04.660 --> 12:06.830
I can't look at you after you say that!

259
12:06.910 --> 12:08.200
Think. Just think.

260
12:08.290 --> 12:10.290
Anything that could clue you in.

261
12:10.790 --> 12:14.580
That reaction she gave me
before was so fake it's painful,

262
12:14.670 --> 12:17.870
which means she probably wants me to think she got a 92.

263
12:17.950 --> 12:20.660
That also means it won't be between 90 and 94

264
12:20.660 --> 12:23.360
because they're all within a two point difference of 92!

265
12:23.660 --> 12:27.380
And like I thought before, the teacher
praised her so it must be above 90 percent.

266
12:27.540 --> 12:29.040
And she said it wasn't 100,

267
12:29.120 --> 12:33.700
so that means it's gotta be between 95 and 99!

268
12:34.080 --> 12:34.910
Perfect.

269
12:35.000 --> 12:36.750
Flawless victory!

270
12:38.040 --> 12:39.140
Takagi.

271
12:39.450 --> 12:41.750
I know what grade you got on the test.

272
12:41.830 --> 12:44.160
You scored a 97 percent!

273
12:46.500 --> 12:48.840
Wrong. I got a 92.

274
12:49.160 --> 12:51.110
Wha?! Come on!

275
12:51.730 --> 12:53.920
You really don't trust me enough.

276
12:54.180 --> 12:57.380
I guess I gave you that three-point
handicap for nothing, huh?

277
13:20.760 --> 13:22.370
Coast is clear.

278
13:25.120 --> 13:26.700
Find everything okay?

279
13:29.040 --> 13:31.830
Four hundred and twenty yen is your total.

280
13:32.660 --> 13:34.200
You're quick with that exact change.

281
13:34.290 --> 13:35.080
Want a cov--?

282
13:35.160 --> 13:35.750
No, thank you.

283
13:35.830 --> 13:36.450
A bag--?

284
13:36.500 --> 13:37.410
No, thank you.

285
13:37.840 --> 13:39.000
A rece--? -- No, thank you.

286
13:40.330 --> 13:41.830
Operation successful.

287
13:41.910 --> 13:44.490
Now to begin phase two: Get home and read it!

288
13:44.540 --> 13:45.450
Oh hey.

289
13:45.540 --> 13:46.640
Good morning.

290
13:49.140 --> 13:50.200
Takagi?

291
13:50.290 --> 13:51.620
What is she doing here?

292
13:51.700 --> 13:52.750
I'm taking a walk.

293
13:52.830 --> 13:54.160
Did she just read my mind?

294
13:54.250 --> 13:56.090
What are you doing here all by yourself?

295
13:56.370 --> 13:57.450
This is bad!

296
13:57.540 --> 13:59.330
I can't let her see what I just bought.

297
13:59.410 --> 14:01.410
I'll have to deny it all the way to my grave.

298
14:01.870 --> 14:02.770
Oh, nothing.

299
14:02.830 --> 14:05.620
It's just that I wanted to buy a
book, but they were sold out--

300
14:05.700 --> 14:07.080
Wait, wait!

301
14:07.160 --> 14:08.620
What if she saw me at the register?

302
14:08.700 --> 14:09.520
Reel it in!

303
14:09.650 --> 14:14.040
So I decided to buy <i>Fierce!!
Ultimate Soccer!!</i> volume eleven instead!

304
14:14.290 --> 14:15.330
The perfect answer!

305
14:15.410 --> 14:18.750
Boys love that series, but I've never
met a girl who'd give it the time of day.

306
14:18.830 --> 14:20.580
You won't care to ask more about it.

307
14:20.660 --> 14:22.200
I'm on a roll today.

308
14:22.290 --> 14:24.230
<i>Fierce-Soccer</i> ? Cool, let me see!

309
14:24.330 --> 14:25.370
Huh?!

310
14:25.750 --> 14:28.210
Uh, but I haven't read it yet.

311
14:28.580 --> 14:30.250
Can I at least see the front cover?

312
14:30.330 --> 14:31.320
No!

313
14:31.410 --> 14:33.410
'Cuz I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, either.

314
14:33.500 --> 14:34.500
And it's my manga.

315
14:34.520 --> 14:35.830
Then, let's look at it together.

316
14:35.910 --> 14:38.120
I happen to like looking at it alone.

317
14:38.200 --> 14:39.500
Awww...

318
14:39.580 --> 14:41.830
I wouldn't have thought she'd be this interested.

319
14:41.830 --> 14:43.500
At this rate, she's gonna blow my cover.

320
14:43.580 --> 14:45.510
Better get away from her and quick.

321
14:45.910 --> 14:47.470
I'll see you around, Takagi.

322
14:47.950 --> 14:48.980
Huh?

323
14:54.110 --> 14:55.020
Hello?

324
14:55.580 --> 14:57.370
Hey, we ran into each other.

325
14:57.450 --> 14:58.840
Let's walk together.

326
14:59.080 --> 15:00.290
Okay, fine.

327
15:01.660 --> 15:03.920
It's pretty unusual to run into someone at the

328
15:03.930 --> 15:06.500
bookstore so far from home this early in the morning.

329
15:08.790 --> 15:13.370
I can't let Takagi see this manga and yet here it
is, three feet from her in my backpack!

330
15:13.370 --> 15:15.410
I feel like my heart's in my throat.

331
15:15.500 --> 15:17.580
I wish I were home already.

332
15:19.080 --> 15:19.790
Hey.

333
15:19.870 --> 15:21.060
Nishikata.

334
15:21.580 --> 15:23.740
Are you lying to me about anything?

335
15:26.410 --> 15:27.540
Are you lying?

336
15:27.910 --> 15:29.490
Uh, um...

337
15:30.830 --> 15:33.200
You didn't buy <i>Fierce-Soccer,</i> did you?

338
15:33.290 --> 15:36.830
I bet you bought something that you're so
embarrassed to have, you had to lie about it.

339
15:36.830 --> 15:37.620
Shut up.

340
15:37.700 --> 15:39.160
That's not...

341
15:39.250 --> 15:41.450
It's just some manga for girls, right?

342
15:41.540 --> 15:43.920
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

343
15:44.200 --> 15:46.590
Okay. There's no point in denying it now, but...

344
15:46.690 --> 15:49.380
...how in the world did you figure it out?

345
15:49.580 --> 15:50.450
Just luck.

346
15:50.540 --> 15:53.950
I happened to be passing by when I
saw you at the register checking out.

347
15:53.950 --> 15:55.790
And I could see what you got.

348
15:55.870 --> 15:58.370
She knew the whole time and was playing me.

349
15:58.450 --> 15:59.830
Is it because you like the anime?

350
15:59.910 --> 16:01.950
I didn't know you read that kind of stuff.

351
16:02.040 --> 16:03.620
Uh, wait up!

352
16:03.700 --> 16:06.950
Please keep it a secret,
I really don't want anyone to know.

353
16:06.950 --> 16:09.420
Catching it on TV is one thing, but if people found

354
16:09.430 --> 16:11.630
out I'm actually buying and reading the manga,

355
16:11.630 --> 16:12.790
I'll be a laughingstock.

356
16:12.870 --> 16:13.580
Hmm...

357
16:13.660 --> 16:15.080
What should I do?

358
16:15.160 --> 16:17.040
I mean, you did lie to me.

359
16:17.190 --> 16:20.660
And that's extra bad,
considering I've never lied to you before.

360
16:22.000 --> 16:23.370
But I won't tell.

361
16:24.120 --> 16:27.330
Huh? You're messing with me.

362
16:27.410 --> 16:28.250
What do you mean?

363
16:28.330 --> 16:29.040
I'm serious.

364
16:29.120 --> 16:31.620
Please don't tell anyone!

365
16:31.700 --> 16:32.790
Yes, sir!

366
16:32.870 --> 16:34.450
Why are you so enthusiastic?

367
16:34.540 --> 16:35.620
It feels fake!

368
16:35.700 --> 16:37.470
You're so persistent.

369
16:37.830 --> 16:41.410
Uh... Then how about this?

370
16:41.500 --> 16:42.700
I know your secret,

371
16:42.790 --> 16:45.540
so it's only fair that I tell you mine, too.

372
16:45.620 --> 16:47.700
That'll make you feel better, right?

373
16:47.790 --> 16:49.660
Since you'll have collateral.

374
16:49.750 --> 16:50.750
Huh?

375
16:50.830 --> 16:52.700
I guess.

376
16:52.790 --> 16:53.580
All right.

377
16:53.660 --> 16:54.870
Come closer.

378
16:54.950 --> 16:58.040
Okay.

379
16:58.120 --> 17:01.500
Truth is I've always kind of liked you.

380
17:04.000 --> 17:05.330
Huh?

381
17:07.750 --> 17:09.160
Huh?! What did she--?

382
17:09.250 --> 17:10.040
What?

383
17:12.500 --> 17:14.040
You're bright red!

384
17:14.120 --> 17:15.620
You blush so quickly.

385
17:15.700 --> 17:17.330
It's classic.

386
17:17.410 --> 17:19.660
Since you lied to me at the bookstore.

387
17:19.750 --> 17:22.390
I figured I'd lie to you as payback.

388
17:24.370 --> 17:25.580
Oh, a lie.

389
17:25.660 --> 17:27.450
You shocked me for a second.

390
17:27.540 --> 17:28.870
That was a lie.

391
17:28.950 --> 17:30.980
Of course it was. Duh, right?

392
17:31.750 --> 17:32.620
See yah!

393
17:32.700 --> 17:34.450
I'm turning this way now.

394
17:34.540 --> 17:35.830
"Duh," right.

395
17:35.910 --> 17:37.680
I'll see you later, bye.

396
17:39.370 --> 17:40.900
A lie, huh?

397
17:41.710 --> 17:43.520
Oh, and Nishikata?

398
17:43.830 --> 17:46.020
I want to read <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> too,

399
17:46.030 --> 17:48.780
so let me know when you're done and I'll borrow it!

400
17:50.580 --> 17:54.050
Ahh! Don't say it so loud, Takagi!

401
18:00.790 --> 18:03.260
This downpour came out of nowhere.

402
18:03.700 --> 18:05.440
I wonder if it'll stop soon.

403
18:05.580 --> 18:06.330
Hmm...

404
18:06.540 --> 18:07.920
Well, I hope so.

405
18:09.620 --> 18:12.790
Aww. Even my socks got wet.

406
18:13.600 --> 18:15.290
How about you? Are you dry?

407
18:15.370 --> 18:17.760
Oh man, I can kinda see through her shirt.

408
18:19.160 --> 18:20.160
You hear me?

409
18:20.250 --> 18:21.830
Uh. Yeah, I heard you.

410
18:21.910 --> 18:22.370
Yeah.

411
18:22.430 --> 18:24.120
Calm down, just calm down!

412
18:24.200 --> 18:27.200
If she realizes I'm panicking,
I'll be branded a pervert!

413
18:27.290 --> 18:29.710
Boy, I sure hope this rain will stop soon.

414
18:30.160 --> 18:33.250
I wanna be home before five,
so I can catch an anime that's on then.

415
18:33.370 --> 18:35.120
It's <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> , by the way.

416
18:35.330 --> 18:36.350
Oh yeah?

417
18:36.660 --> 18:38.580
That's the one you bought at the bookstore, right?

418
18:38.660 --> 18:42.040
Or no, I'm mistaken. That's <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

419
18:42.120 --> 18:44.870
You promised me you were never
going to bring that up again!

420
18:44.870 --> 18:46.200
What, I can't talk about it?

421
18:46.290 --> 18:47.910
You know your own secret.

422
18:49.660 --> 18:51.290
I hope this clears up fast.

423
18:54.500 --> 18:57.000
Uhh. Yeah.

424
18:58.870 --> 19:00.040
Aw man.

425
19:00.120 --> 19:02.120
This got a little wet, too.

426
19:02.200 --> 19:04.250
Hey, do you have your P.E. shirt on you?

427
19:04.330 --> 19:06.000
Uh. Yeah, why?

428
19:06.080 --> 19:07.700
Do you mind if I borrow it?

429
19:07.790 --> 19:08.910
I'll give it back.

430
19:09.000 --> 19:10.290
I want to change out of this.

431
19:10.370 --> 19:11.790
Huh? Wait, what?

432
19:11.870 --> 19:13.620
You want to change into my P.E. shirt?

433
19:13.700 --> 19:14.660
Like, right here?

434
19:14.700 --> 19:17.660
Yup. My shirt's wet; I feel all gross.

435
19:17.750 --> 19:18.660
But aren't you--?

436
19:18.750 --> 19:22.120
And besides, I know you're having
trouble deciding where to look.

437
19:22.120 --> 19:23.620
Busted.

438
19:24.250 --> 19:25.790
Can you turn the other way?

439
19:25.870 --> 19:28.080
Y-Yeah.

440
19:28.160 --> 19:30.750
You managed to stay pretty dry, huh?

441
19:32.370 --> 19:33.580
How? Oh.

442
19:33.660 --> 19:35.700
Did you use your bag as an umbrella?

443
19:35.790 --> 19:38.370
Mm-hmm.

444
19:38.450 --> 19:39.620
Good thinking.

445
19:39.700 --> 19:42.250
I had to hold my bike, so I couldn't do that.

446
19:42.330 --> 19:44.250
Yeah, that makes sense.

447
19:45.830 --> 19:47.540
You know, you can look if you want.

448
19:47.620 --> 19:49.620
Huh? I can look?

449
19:49.700 --> 19:51.450
What are you trying to say?

450
19:51.540 --> 19:53.200
Because I'm done changing.

451
19:55.200 --> 19:56.790
Why are you so flustered?

452
19:56.870 --> 19:59.500
She's screwing with me.

453
19:59.580 --> 20:00.500
Hey.

454
20:00.580 --> 20:01.920
Wanna make a bet?

455
20:02.870 --> 20:07.410
We can bet on whether or not the rain will
stop by the time the town clock strikes five.

456
20:07.410 --> 20:09.830
The loser has to do anything the winner wants.

457
20:09.910 --> 20:10.580
Why not?

458
20:10.660 --> 20:12.200
Okay, what's your bet?

459
20:12.290 --> 20:13.950
That it won't stop in time.

460
20:14.040 --> 20:14.660
Cool.

461
20:14.750 --> 20:16.170
Then I bet it will.

462
20:17.910 --> 20:20.950
If the rain stops,
I can go home and watch <i>Fierce-Soccer.</i>

463
20:20.950 --> 20:23.250
If it doesn't, I get to order Takagi around.

464
20:23.330 --> 20:25.160
It's win-win!

465
20:26.000 --> 20:27.290
There we go.

466
20:27.370 --> 20:29.200
I feel much better now that I've changed my shirt.

467
20:29.290 --> 20:30.910
Thanks a bunch, Nishikata.

468
20:31.000 --> 20:32.790
Yeah, don't mention it.

469
20:32.870 --> 20:34.750
It does smell kinda sweaty, though.

470
20:34.830 --> 20:37.660
Of course it does, it's been super-hot out!

471
20:40.000 --> 20:41.370
Whoa.

472
20:41.450 --> 20:43.700
That shirt touched my skin and now it's touching hers.

473
20:43.790 --> 20:45.830
Agh! Stop it! What am I thinking?

474
20:47.830 --> 20:49.400
--A cat. -- Oh. Hey.

475
20:49.620 --> 20:51.200
Are you trying to get out of the rain?

476
20:51.290 --> 20:52.750
Come here.

477
20:52.830 --> 20:54.620
He's cute, but be careful.

478
20:54.700 --> 20:56.080
He scratches.

479
20:59.330 --> 21:01.250
Do you want me to give you your shirt back?

480
21:01.330 --> 21:02.830
No. I'm fine.

481
21:04.910 --> 21:06.910
Why don't you wear my P.E. shirt?

482
21:07.000 --> 21:07.530
Huh?

483
21:07.600 --> 21:10.840
It did get a little wet,
but it's better than what you've got on.

484
21:12.040 --> 21:13.080
And now,

485
21:13.080 --> 21:17.060
The shirt that touched Takagi's
skin will be touching mine.

486
21:17.410 --> 21:18.450
Are you done yet?

487
21:20.040 --> 21:22.580
Come on, you're not supposed to look!

488
21:23.080 --> 21:25.970
For some reason this feels naughty.

489
21:29.290 --> 21:30.980
It smells good.

490
21:42.450 --> 21:43.840
I guess I win.

491
21:44.530 --> 21:46.100
What should I make you do?

492
21:47.380 --> 21:48.540
Oh, well.

493
21:48.660 --> 21:51.370
At least, <i>Fierce-Soccer</i> 'll be on when I get home.

494
21:51.450 --> 21:53.620
I'll do what she wants and hurry back.

495
21:53.700 --> 21:54.750
Oh, I know!

496
21:54.830 --> 21:56.000
Huh?

497
21:56.700 --> 21:58.000
Now that it's stopped raining,

498
21:58.080 --> 21:59.790
let's go somewhere before we head home.

499
21:59.870 --> 22:01.330
Wait, I wanted to--

500
22:01.410 --> 22:03.790
The bet was, the loser does what the winner wants!

501
22:03.870 --> 22:04.700
Let's go.

502
22:04.790 --> 22:06.330
Why?!

503
02:15.010 --> 02:19.010
<b>"Studying for the Test"</b>

504
06:54.950 --> 06:57.950
<b>"Test"</b>

505
08:19.950 --> 08:23.960
