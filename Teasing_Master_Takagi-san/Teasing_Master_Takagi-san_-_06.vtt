1
00:02.250 --> 00:02.830
Well...

2
00:02.830 --> 00:05.620
As I'm sure you know, summer vacation starts tomorrow.

3
00:05.700 --> 00:07.910
Try not to get into any trouble.

4
00:12.620 --> 00:14.450
Summer vacation is gonna be awesome!

5
00:14.540 --> 00:15.270
Hey.

6
00:15.850 --> 00:17.950
We're thinking of going to the beach tomorrow, you in?

7
00:18.040 --> 00:19.450
Yeah, you know it, dude.

8
00:19.540 --> 00:22.290
I suddenly have a huge craving for watermelon!

9
00:22.370 --> 00:23.500
I'd eat some watermelon.

10
00:23.580 --> 00:24.950
Perfect! Let's get one for tomorrow!

11
00:25.040 --> 00:25.950
Good idea!

12
02:06.040 --> 02:07.080
Summer vacation.

13
02:07.160 --> 02:08.500
You excited?

14
02:08.580 --> 02:09.750
Yeah.

15
02:09.810 --> 02:12.000
It feels like I've been waiting for it forever.

16
02:12.080 --> 02:14.000
Now I can play as much as I want!

17
02:14.080 --> 02:15.200
I'm a free man!

18
02:15.200 --> 02:17.540
You better not forget about your homework.

19
02:17.620 --> 02:19.290
Knowing you, you'll put it off.

20
02:19.370 --> 02:21.830
I bet you're thinking "play first, work later."

21
02:22.200 --> 02:23.080
How'd you know?

22
02:23.160 --> 02:24.830
Haha! So I was right?

23
02:24.910 --> 02:25.870
Well yeah.

24
02:25.870 --> 02:28.700
But the whole point of a break is to relax, right?

25
02:28.790 --> 02:31.750
I wanna go to the pool, hit the
beach, and go camping and stuff.

26
02:31.830 --> 02:34.390
Man, I barely have enough time to do all that!

27
02:35.250 --> 02:39.160
I wish we could just have summer vacation forever.

28
02:39.250 --> 02:40.660
Yeah?

29
02:40.750 --> 02:42.960
I like going to school, too, though.

30
02:43.370 --> 02:44.480
Because...

31
02:48.290 --> 02:49.150
It's fun.

32
02:51.080 --> 02:53.500
No more of that for a while, huh?

33
02:54.410 --> 02:55.550
So hot!

34
02:55.680 --> 02:57.500
But the breeze feels great!

35
02:57.580 --> 02:59.750
Can you go faster? This rocks!

36
02:59.830 --> 03:02.410
You wouldn't be saying that if you were pedaling!

37
03:07.750 --> 03:09.220
It's hot out.

38
03:15.500 --> 03:17.370
Should we do what they were doing?

39
03:17.450 --> 03:18.160
Huh?!

40
03:18.160 --> 03:20.000
Of course, you'd have to be in the front.

41
03:20.080 --> 03:21.700
No. We can't!

42
03:21.790 --> 03:24.850
Uh. 'Cuz it'd be dangerous
with cars driving by, you know?

43
03:25.120 --> 03:26.410
There are no cars around.

44
03:26.500 --> 03:28.240
It's not even a public road.

45
03:28.700 --> 03:29.910
Yeah, but.

46
03:30.000 --> 03:30.950
Hold on.

47
03:31.040 --> 03:32.540
Are you embarrassed or something?

48
03:32.620 --> 03:34.330
No! Of course I'm not embarrassed!

49
03:34.410 --> 03:35.080
Oh.

50
03:35.160 --> 03:36.750
You can't do it, then?

51
03:36.830 --> 03:38.000
What are you talking about?

52
03:38.080 --> 03:40.330
Tandem riding is super easy.

53
03:40.410 --> 03:43.360
I just don't think we should do it, 'cuz it's not safe.

54
03:45.410 --> 03:46.870
Let's go to the vacant lot, then.

55
03:46.950 --> 03:48.040
Huh?!

56
03:53.830 --> 03:56.910
If you can't do it, then you owe me a juice.

57
03:57.000 --> 03:58.540
I hope you're not too thirsty,

58
03:58.620 --> 04:00.600
because I got this, no sweat.

59
04:03.290 --> 04:04.450
Hmm?

60
04:04.540 --> 04:06.250
That was just the practice run!

61
04:06.330 --> 04:07.640
I can do this!

62
04:10.750 --> 04:11.750
I'll take grape.

63
04:11.830 --> 04:13.160
Could ya gimme a second?!

64
04:13.250 --> 04:16.800
Is it really this hard to ride with
someone sitting on the back of a bike?

65
04:17.160 --> 04:20.870
Just checking, but you're not trying to
throw us off balance on purpose, are you?

66
04:20.870 --> 04:22.250
Of course not.

67
04:22.330 --> 04:23.290
Are you sure.

68
04:23.370 --> 04:25.570
I'm just sitting how I usually sit.

69
04:25.830 --> 04:27.080
If we can't get it to work,

70
04:27.160 --> 04:28.950
then it's gotta be your fault.

71
04:29.040 --> 04:30.790
I mean...

72
04:30.870 --> 04:32.620
...the last time I did this with someone.

73
04:32.700 --> 04:35.490
They didn't have any trouble peddling.

74
04:36.000 --> 04:36.910
Oh, really?

75
04:37.000 --> 04:37.860
That's cool.

76
04:38.450 --> 04:40.000
I take it they were a girl?

77
04:40.500 --> 04:41.040
Nope.

78
04:41.500 --> 04:42.450
Not a girl.

79
04:42.740 --> 04:43.690
I see.

80
04:50.580 --> 04:51.450
One more time.

81
04:51.540 --> 04:53.500
I think I've almost got it!

82
04:53.660 --> 04:56.750
This time for sure!

83
04:56.830 --> 04:57.580
What's going on?

84
04:57.660 --> 04:58.700
Why do I feel so frustrated?

85
04:58.740 --> 05:01.750
I'm just riding a bike!

86
05:01.830 --> 05:02.540
What's up?

87
05:02.620 --> 05:03.620
You're getting into this.

88
05:03.700 --> 05:04.790
No, I'm not!

89
05:04.790 --> 05:07.370
I just don't wanna waste my hard earned money on you!

90
05:07.450 --> 05:08.620
Yeah, that's it!

91
05:08.700 --> 05:10.910
I just don't want to buy her a drink! That's all!

92
05:15.290 --> 05:16.620
Hey!

93
05:16.700 --> 05:17.950
We're moving!

94
05:18.040 --> 05:19.870
By the way, Nishikata,

95
05:19.950 --> 05:22.580
the last time I rode on the back of someone's bike,

96
05:22.660 --> 05:24.830
it was my dad's.

97
05:24.910 --> 05:26.790
I think I was four at the time.

98
05:34.750 --> 05:35.500
Take it.

99
05:35.580 --> 05:37.540
Why, thank you.

100
05:42.290 --> 05:43.160
Ahh...

101
05:43.250 --> 05:44.870
That's good!

102
05:46.160 --> 05:48.250
Are you not gonna get yourself a drink, too?

103
05:48.330 --> 05:49.640
Uh. Nope.

104
05:49.830 --> 05:52.690
I'm, uhh, not thirsty.

105
05:52.910 --> 05:55.200
I can't tell her I have no money to buy my own.

106
05:55.290 --> 05:57.040
How would that look?

107
05:58.620 --> 05:59.620
Want some?

108
06:03.700 --> 06:04.750
No.

109
06:04.830 --> 06:06.080
I'm fine, thanks.

110
06:06.410 --> 06:09.710
She'd just call it an indirect
kiss again to get me to blush.

111
06:10.410 --> 06:12.080
Come on, I know you're thirsty.

112
06:12.160 --> 06:12.870
Have some.

113
06:12.950 --> 06:14.690
I really don't want any.

114
06:17.500 --> 06:18.610
Endure it.

115
06:19.370 --> 06:21.410
You can do it.

116
06:21.500 --> 06:22.760
Endure.

117
06:25.830 --> 06:27.080
Drink this.

118
06:27.160 --> 06:29.570
We can't have you getting heatstroke.

119
06:29.910 --> 06:31.410
I can have it?

120
06:31.500 --> 06:33.000
Yeah.

121
06:34.040 --> 06:35.910
Besides.

122
06:36.000 --> 06:37.330
I know you.

123
06:37.410 --> 06:39.750
You don't want mine because it's an indirect kiss.

124
06:39.830 --> 06:41.620
Huh?!

125
06:41.700 --> 06:43.120
Tha-That's not it!

126
06:43.200 --> 06:44.910
I'm just not thirsty!

127
06:45.000 --> 06:46.160
Right.

128
06:46.250 --> 06:47.700
But you'll drink yours?

129
06:47.790 --> 06:49.750
Well, you already bought it.

130
06:49.830 --> 06:52.070
It'd be a waste when it's this hot.

131
06:54.950 --> 06:56.370
Thanks for the drink.

132
06:59.540 --> 07:01.620
We won't be walking home from school for a while.

133
07:01.700 --> 07:02.580
Ahhh...

134
07:02.660 --> 07:03.450
Got that right.

135
07:03.540 --> 07:05.370
We're on vacation, after all.

136
07:07.250 --> 07:08.540
I know!

137
07:08.620 --> 07:12.660
How about starting tomorrow,
we practice tandem riding here until noon?

138
07:12.660 --> 07:15.160
Okay, I guess.

139
07:15.250 --> 07:16.200
But not on the road.

140
07:16.290 --> 07:17.330
That's what I meant.

141
07:17.410 --> 07:19.040
We'll just ride here.

142
07:19.120 --> 07:23.660
If we're only ever gonna ride here,
there's no point in practicing.

143
07:23.660 --> 07:25.910
Yeah, there is.

144
07:26.000 --> 07:27.040
You know.

145
07:27.120 --> 07:28.580
Summer vacation.

146
07:28.660 --> 07:30.830
It starts tomorrow.

147
07:31.950 --> 07:33.700
What does that mean?

148
07:34.500 --> 07:35.660
All right!

149
07:35.750 --> 07:38.080
Well, we should head home.

150
07:41.160 --> 07:42.370
Summer vacation.

151
07:42.450 --> 07:43.620
Huh?

152
07:43.700 --> 07:44.540
I'm excited.

153
07:44.620 --> 07:46.400
It'll be fun!

154
07:47.080 --> 07:48.870
Yeah, obviously.

155
07:54.080 --> 07:56.200
Why'd it have to rain on our first day off?

156
07:56.290 --> 07:57.330
I know.

157
07:57.410 --> 08:00.950
Summer vacation's barely even started,
and my plans are already ruined!

158
08:00.950 --> 08:02.750
It's not like it's supposed to rain tomorrow.

159
08:02.830 --> 08:05.160
I wanted to go to the pool today.

160
08:05.250 --> 08:07.700
And I'm never getting that time back!

161
08:07.790 --> 08:09.490
Please stop crying.

162
08:10.790 --> 08:13.160
You know we can't do anything about the rain.

163
08:13.250 --> 08:15.000
Let's just start our homework.

164
08:15.080 --> 08:16.250
--Huh? --Huh?

165
08:16.330 --> 08:17.950
What's with those faces?

166
08:18.040 --> 08:20.750
Don't tell me you two didn't bring yours.

167
08:21.540 --> 08:24.580
I told you guys to bring your
homework over since it's raining out!

168
08:24.580 --> 08:26.450
I figured I must have misheard you.

169
08:26.540 --> 08:27.660
Unbelievable!

170
08:27.750 --> 08:31.120
Why do we get assigned homework during
summer vacation in the first place?

171
08:31.120 --> 08:32.950
It's a violation of human rights.

172
08:33.040 --> 08:34.870
It's hardly a break with homework.

173
08:34.950 --> 08:36.250
Right?

174
08:36.330 --> 08:39.000
Dream all you want, we still have to do it.

175
08:49.580 --> 08:51.540
Ugh! Do me a personal favor,

176
08:51.620 --> 08:53.830
Quit doing your homework and relax!

177
08:53.910 --> 08:58.200
Seeing you do yours reminds me that I have to do
mine, and now I can't enjoy myself!

178
08:58.200 --> 08:59.160
Whatever!

179
08:59.250 --> 09:00.830
Maybe you need the reminder!

180
09:01.950 --> 09:03.660
It's only the first day still.

181
09:03.750 --> 09:06.210
Just forget about school.

182
09:09.250 --> 09:14.040
Typical, from a person who will be crying
with regret on August thirty-first.

183
09:14.040 --> 09:15.440
You're so stubborn.

184
09:15.870 --> 09:17.950
Forget you. I'm gonna read manga.

185
09:19.000 --> 09:19.910
Yeah?

186
09:20.000 --> 09:21.160
Fine.

187
09:24.370 --> 09:25.700
Hey, Yukari?

188
09:25.790 --> 09:27.000
Hmm?

189
09:27.080 --> 09:28.250
I got a great idea.

190
09:28.330 --> 09:30.370
Can we write our book report on manga?

191
09:30.450 --> 09:32.330
Yes, please.

192
09:32.410 --> 09:35.040
Can you two just go home already?

193
09:44.950 --> 09:45.910
It stopped raining.

194
09:46.000 --> 09:47.110
Awesome!

195
09:47.660 --> 09:50.790
Wait, why exactly am I happy about that again?

196
09:56.290 --> 09:57.460
Nishikata.

197
10:04.160 --> 10:05.450
You're here.

198
10:05.540 --> 10:07.660
Yeah, we made a promise, didn't we?

199
10:07.750 --> 10:09.120
Guess so.

200
10:12.040 --> 10:13.200
Something wrong?

201
10:13.290 --> 10:14.200
Uh.

202
10:14.290 --> 10:15.330
No.

203
10:15.410 --> 10:17.160
It's nothing.

204
10:17.250 --> 10:18.200
Whoa.

205
10:18.290 --> 10:20.120
There are so many puddles here.

206
10:20.200 --> 10:21.450
Well, you know what they say.

207
10:21.540 --> 10:23.200
When it rains, it pours.

208
10:23.290 --> 10:26.000
I didn't recognize her for a second there.

209
10:26.080 --> 10:29.910
Come to think of it, I've run into her
a few times on our days off by chance,

210
10:29.910 --> 10:32.540
but this is our first time meeting up.

211
10:33.750 --> 10:34.660
No way!

212
10:34.750 --> 10:36.910
This isn't like, a date, is it?

213
10:37.000 --> 10:38.700
No, obviously not!

214
10:38.790 --> 10:41.370
We're just here to practice tandem
riding, like we agreed to!

215
10:41.370 --> 10:42.450
Nishikata?

216
10:42.540 --> 10:44.910
Huh?! What's up?

217
10:45.000 --> 10:45.870
You hear me?

218
10:45.950 --> 10:46.750
Hello?

219
10:46.830 --> 10:48.790
No. Sorry.

220
10:48.870 --> 10:50.750
What did you say?

221
10:50.830 --> 10:53.250
This place is in pretty bad riding condition.

222
10:53.330 --> 10:55.580
Uh, yeah.

223
10:55.660 --> 10:56.910
Actually,

224
10:57.000 --> 10:59.910
I was planning to go out after we practiced today.

225
11:00.000 --> 11:01.450
No sense going back home.

226
11:01.540 --> 11:04.000
Do you wanna hang out with me to kill some time?

227
11:04.080 --> 11:05.910
Okay.

228
11:06.000 --> 11:07.040
Is this a date?

229
11:07.120 --> 11:09.750
No, no, no.

230
11:09.830 --> 11:10.750
No way!

231
11:10.830 --> 11:12.790
Uh. Yeah, that's fine.

232
11:12.870 --> 11:15.620
But let's go someplace where
there aren't too many people.

233
11:15.700 --> 11:18.830
There's no telling what our
classmates would say if they saw us!

234
11:18.830 --> 11:20.450
Hmmm...

235
11:20.540 --> 11:22.040
How about...

236
11:22.120 --> 11:23.430
That's it!

237
11:26.330 --> 11:27.790
A test of courage?

238
11:27.870 --> 11:29.660
Perfect for summer, right?

239
11:29.750 --> 11:31.950
Wouldn't it be scarier if we did it at night?

240
11:32.040 --> 11:33.330
Not by much.

241
11:33.410 --> 11:35.790
I heard it gets pitch black when you're in there.

242
11:38.660 --> 11:41.410
Some say, there's a presence.

243
11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
Sorry.

244
11:42.580 --> 11:43.200
What?

245
11:43.290 --> 11:44.330
A presence?

246
11:44.410 --> 11:45.800
Well, that's what I heard.

247
11:46.200 --> 11:48.660
This tunnel doesn't have any sharp turns.

248
11:48.750 --> 11:52.910
But for some reason, a lot of cars ended
up crashing straight into the walls.

249
11:52.910 --> 11:55.500
So they had to make a new road nearby.

250
11:57.540 --> 12:02.790
And since then, every night, without
fail, a bloodthirsty ghost appears.

251
12:02.790 --> 12:05.120
Looking for cars to prey upon.

252
12:05.200 --> 12:07.040
But there's even more to it.

253
12:07.120 --> 12:08.120
Rumor has it.

254
12:08.200 --> 12:10.620
People are spirited away here.

255
12:10.700 --> 12:11.450
Dozens.

256
12:11.650 --> 12:14.590
Maybe more have disappeared right in this very tunnel.

257
12:15.830 --> 12:17.410
Are you going in?

258
12:17.830 --> 12:20.290
Or are you chicken?

259
12:21.040 --> 12:22.940
I am so not chicken!

260
12:23.250 --> 12:24.390
It's the middle of the day!

261
12:24.390 --> 12:29.500
Why would I be scared of going in some
dusty, stupid, old tunnel?

262
12:29.500 --> 12:33.330
It's way darker than I thought.

263
12:36.290 --> 12:39.120
Why is the wind making such a weird noise?

264
12:39.200 --> 12:40.040
Hey.

265
12:40.120 --> 12:42.160
Check out what's on the wall.

266
12:42.250 --> 12:43.750
A talisman?

267
12:43.830 --> 12:44.750
For spirits.

268
12:44.830 --> 12:46.160
It keeps them away.

269
12:46.250 --> 12:47.700
So clearly,

270
12:47.790 --> 12:50.660
there must be something evil in here.

271
12:53.540 --> 12:55.110
I'm not surprised you're scared.

272
12:55.110 --> 12:55.810
I'm not!

273
12:55.810 --> 12:56.910
I was just shocked, that's all!

274
12:57.000 --> 12:57.950
Look!

275
12:58.040 --> 13:00.410
Uh, great; what is it this time?

276
13:02.290 --> 13:03.500
Weird.

277
13:03.580 --> 13:05.750
I wonder what this steel barrel is doing here.

278
13:05.830 --> 13:07.870
Uh. Yeah.

279
13:07.950 --> 13:08.660
All right.

280
13:08.750 --> 13:10.200
I vote you look inside.

281
13:10.290 --> 13:12.120
Huh?

282
13:12.200 --> 13:13.290
Are you scared?

283
13:13.370 --> 13:14.950
Will you stop saying that?

284
13:15.040 --> 13:16.120
I'll look.

285
13:16.200 --> 13:18.410
It's not that big of a deal.

286
13:33.200 --> 13:34.250
Ah!

287
13:39.580 --> 13:42.040
That's what I was really worried about!

288
13:43.700 --> 13:44.850
Takagi?

289
13:47.250 --> 13:48.500
Takagi?

290
13:48.750 --> 13:50.260
Where'd you run off to?

291
13:54.290 --> 13:56.500
Quit messing with me.

292
13:57.080 --> 14:00.620
Didn't she mention something about being spirited away?

293
14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
But that couldn't...

294
14:02.700 --> 14:03.950
Takagi!

295
14:04.040 --> 14:05.830
Answer me!

296
14:05.910 --> 14:07.580
Takagi!

297
14:15.870 --> 14:17.410
What are you freaking out for?

298
14:17.500 --> 14:18.620
It's just me.

299
14:18.700 --> 14:20.290
Where'd you come from?

300
14:20.370 --> 14:21.540
Hey.

301
14:21.620 --> 14:24.250
You were looking for me just now, weren't you?

302
14:24.330 --> 14:25.950
Huh? Yeah right.

303
14:26.040 --> 14:27.830
Why would I do that?

304
14:27.910 --> 14:30.630
So she lured me in here to jump-scare me a ton.

305
14:31.910 --> 14:32.500
Whoa.

306
14:32.580 --> 14:34.910
Look at that.

307
14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
That's a big hole.

308
14:37.080 --> 14:39.270
Why don't you take a peek inside it?

309
14:40.120 --> 14:42.200
Like I'd fall for the same trick twice.

310
14:42.290 --> 14:43.680
Don't make me laugh!

311
14:44.380 --> 14:45.870
Oh no, I'm stuck!

312
14:45.950 --> 14:47.950
My hand's stuck in the hole!

313
14:48.040 --> 14:49.370
How do you like my acting?

314
14:49.450 --> 14:50.450
I've been working on it.

315
14:50.540 --> 14:52.540
I'm gonna freak you out so bad!

316
14:52.620 --> 14:54.120
I don't know what,

317
14:54.200 --> 14:56.080
but it feels like something's
pulling me from the other side!

318
14:56.160 --> 14:57.250
Help me--!

319
14:57.330 --> 15:00.200
Nishikata.

320
15:02.910 --> 15:03.580
Did I scare you?

321
15:03.660 --> 15:04.250
No.

322
15:04.330 --> 15:05.250
What is that?

323
15:05.330 --> 15:06.750
I dunno, I found it on the ground.

324
15:09.580 --> 15:10.290
Oh!

325
15:10.370 --> 15:12.120
Glad your hand came loose.

326
15:13.620 --> 15:14.490
Man.

327
15:14.560 --> 15:16.870
I gotta find some way to get
her before we leave this tunnel!

328
15:19.620 --> 15:21.620
As jumpy as usual.

329
15:23.580 --> 15:24.750
Ahh...

330
15:24.830 --> 15:26.160
Some fresh air!

331
15:26.250 --> 15:27.410
This sucks.

332
15:27.500 --> 15:29.790
I couldn't find anything to get her back with.

333
15:30.830 --> 15:33.750
Must be another couple on a date in the spooky tunnel.

334
15:33.830 --> 15:35.330
Don't bother them.

335
15:35.410 --> 15:36.120
Let's go.

336
15:36.200 --> 15:38.040
Okay.

337
15:40.750 --> 15:42.200
She called it a "date."

338
15:42.290 --> 15:44.410
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

339
15:44.500 --> 15:46.120
Hmm?

340
15:46.200 --> 15:47.120
What is it?

341
15:47.200 --> 15:48.870
You're blushing again.

342
15:50.370 --> 15:51.870
Did you have fun back there?

343
15:51.950 --> 15:53.290
Because I did.

344
15:53.370 --> 15:54.750
I guess.

345
15:54.830 --> 15:56.450
Yeah, but...

346
15:56.540 --> 15:58.700
It's almost noon, we should go back home soon.

347
15:58.790 --> 16:00.540
Yeah, let's.

348
16:00.620 --> 16:02.120
What way are you going?

349
16:04.580 --> 16:07.200
You want to go back through there?

350
16:07.290 --> 16:08.250
Yeah, why not?

351
16:08.330 --> 16:09.330
Are you scared?

352
16:09.410 --> 16:10.700
When am I ever?

353
16:17.790 --> 16:20.150
I met my quota for the day.

354
16:20.950 --> 16:21.580
Wait.

355
16:21.660 --> 16:23.120
It's summer vacation.

356
16:23.200 --> 16:26.410
Why do I still have just as
many push-ups to do as normal?

357
16:30.290 --> 16:32.950
Yes, the consommé flavor is quite good.

358
16:33.040 --> 16:33.870
Don't lie.

359
16:33.950 --> 16:35.080
Your eyes are watering.

360
16:35.160 --> 16:36.500
No, they're not.

361
16:36.580 --> 16:38.870
And I know it's better than your kelp flavor.

362
16:38.950 --> 16:40.330
They both sound awful.

363
16:40.410 --> 16:43.870
There are so many flavors to choose from.
Why would you pick those?

364
16:43.870 --> 16:46.410
You wouldn't understand, miss watermelon.

365
16:46.500 --> 16:49.000
Take risks while you're still young, right?

366
16:49.080 --> 16:51.870
That's some philosophy to apply to popsicles.

367
16:51.950 --> 16:55.080
Hey, did you two decide on
subjects for the science project?

368
16:55.080 --> 16:56.000
Not yet.

369
16:56.080 --> 16:57.450
Me neither.

370
16:57.540 --> 16:58.540
You?

371
16:58.620 --> 17:00.500
I'm still thinking, too.

372
17:02.410 --> 17:04.540
Isn't there something easy I can do?

373
17:04.620 --> 17:06.500
Like, finish-in-a-day easy?

374
17:06.580 --> 17:08.450
Just do actual research.

375
17:08.540 --> 17:10.000
Hmm...

376
17:10.080 --> 17:12.000
A dog observation diary?

377
17:12.080 --> 17:13.580
Ah! Awesome idea!

378
17:13.660 --> 17:15.330
That sounds super easy!

379
17:15.410 --> 17:18.040
And dogs basically behave the same way every day.

380
17:18.120 --> 17:20.500
So I can just copy the entries and change the dates!

381
17:20.580 --> 17:23.000
If you're gonna lie, write it by hand at least.

382
17:23.080 --> 17:25.160
Besides, dogs barely do anything.

383
17:25.250 --> 17:28.080
They wake up, bark for a walk, bark to be fed,

384
17:28.160 --> 17:29.950
and sleep every chance they get.

385
17:30.040 --> 17:31.910
Maybe they'll wake up and bark for attention,

386
17:32.000 --> 17:34.250
but then they'll just bark for food again.

387
17:34.330 --> 17:36.620
Why would anyone want to observe that?

388
17:36.700 --> 17:38.790
You're such a stick in the mud, Yukari.

389
17:38.870 --> 17:40.870
Well she is the class president.

390
17:40.950 --> 17:42.660
It comes with the territory.

391
17:42.750 --> 17:44.250
Right?

392
17:44.330 --> 17:45.910
Shut up.

393
17:46.000 --> 17:49.080
Anyway, have you two started to do your homework yet?

394
17:51.290 --> 17:53.000
We've still got plenty of time.

395
17:53.080 --> 17:54.450
Right?

396
17:56.330 --> 17:57.160
Just so you know.

397
17:57.250 --> 17:59.040
You're not copying mine.

398
17:59.910 --> 18:02.440
Not even if I do your science project for you?

399
18:02.440 --> 18:03.250
On a dog?

400
18:03.250 --> 18:04.290
No, thank you.

401
18:04.370 --> 18:07.790
You say this now, but you're gonna end
up sharing your answers with us anyway.

402
18:07.790 --> 18:09.580
She wants the class to get good grades.

403
18:09.660 --> 18:11.160
Right?

404
18:11.250 --> 18:15.110
Maybe I should do an observation
diary on their procrastination habits.

405
18:20.000 --> 18:21.910
So hot.

406
18:23.500 --> 18:26.330
This is the worst day of vacation yet.

407
18:27.830 --> 18:28.660
Are you kidding?

408
18:28.750 --> 18:30.560
First, I overslept.

409
18:32.540 --> 18:34.660
And then I had a flat tire.

410
18:35.910 --> 18:39.290
But at least all this happened on a
day we're not practicing tandem riding.

411
18:39.290 --> 18:41.950
Takagi said she was going on a family vacation.

412
18:43.620 --> 18:45.280
When's she coming back from that?

413
18:46.000 --> 18:49.500
I was gonna stay home for a few hours and do
chores, so I could have the afternoon free,

414
18:49.500 --> 18:52.140
but of course I was sent on a shopping trip.

415
18:52.540 --> 18:55.370
Truly this is the darkest of vacations.

416
18:55.450 --> 18:57.930
That kinda sounded poetic, I should write it down.

417
19:01.200 --> 19:02.390
That looks like...

418
19:04.830 --> 19:06.620
Yeah, it's Takagi.

419
19:07.840 --> 19:08.500
Huh.

420
19:08.910 --> 19:11.000
I guess she's back.

421
19:11.080 --> 19:14.660
I might as well use this opportunity to follow her.

422
19:16.200 --> 19:19.410
Maybe I can find a weakness to exploit in the future.

423
19:34.120 --> 19:35.250
Uh oh.

424
19:35.330 --> 19:36.950
Did she see me there?

425
19:37.040 --> 19:39.120
Maybe it was my imagination.

426
19:40.330 --> 19:42.120
No, she did see me!

427
19:42.200 --> 19:44.880
But I can see her hat sticking out around the corner.

428
19:45.700 --> 19:47.700
You think you're gonna surprise me, don't you?

429
19:47.790 --> 19:49.750
Not while I still may breathe!

430
19:49.830 --> 19:51.620
I should write that down, too.

431
19:58.580 --> 20:01.160
She... She got me!

432
20:01.250 --> 20:02.160
Going somewhere?

433
20:02.250 --> 20:02.870
Yeah.

434
20:02.950 --> 20:04.700
Just grocery shopping.

435
20:04.790 --> 20:05.370
Hey.

436
20:05.450 --> 20:06.580
What a coincidence.

437
20:06.660 --> 20:08.290
I am too.

438
20:08.370 --> 20:10.620
We could take your bike, ride tandem?

439
20:10.700 --> 20:11.700
Come on.

440
20:11.790 --> 20:13.750
We agreed no doing that in the road.

441
20:14.370 --> 20:16.540
When did she find out I was following her?

442
20:16.620 --> 20:17.330
Fine.

443
20:17.410 --> 20:18.330
Let's walk together, then.

444
20:19.660 --> 20:21.160
Oh no! I gotcha!

445
20:24.370 --> 20:25.870
Are you okay?

446
20:26.410 --> 20:29.540
And the curse of today continues.

447
20:30.040 --> 20:31.370
You're hurt.

448
20:31.450 --> 20:34.080
Nah. It's nothing. I'll just let it be.

449
20:34.160 --> 20:35.450
Don't do that.

450
20:35.540 --> 20:37.030
You should wash it off.

451
20:46.200 --> 20:47.660
How embarrassing.

452
20:47.750 --> 20:49.620
Does your knee hurt that much?

453
20:49.700 --> 20:50.950
No.

454
20:51.040 --> 20:55.790
It's just that I was already having a bad
day, and now I got a cut, too.

455
20:55.790 --> 20:58.660
I'm wallowing in how much this vacation sucks.

456
20:58.750 --> 21:02.560
And it's not like I can write about
my misfortunes for my summer homework.

457
21:02.910 --> 21:03.410
Here.

458
21:03.500 --> 21:05.950
Huh?

459
21:06.040 --> 21:07.370
But it'll stain.

460
21:07.450 --> 21:09.500
Don't worry, just take it.

461
21:10.580 --> 21:11.540
Uh.

462
21:11.620 --> 21:12.910
Thank you.

463
21:25.120 --> 21:27.200
That feels nice!

464
21:27.790 --> 21:30.880
So you tried to catch me before, right?

465
21:32.410 --> 21:33.950
Thanks for that.

466
21:35.000 --> 21:36.200
You should come in.

467
21:36.290 --> 21:38.160
The cold water's really nice.

468
21:38.250 --> 21:40.580
Uh, No, I...

469
21:40.660 --> 21:42.300
You know you want to.

470
21:46.160 --> 21:47.660
Cooling you down?

471
21:47.750 --> 21:49.290
Uh.

472
21:50.290 --> 21:51.200
You know what?

473
21:51.290 --> 21:54.540
I had a good day.

474
21:54.620 --> 21:56.700
Because I got to see someone.

475
21:56.790 --> 21:58.290
Huh?

476
21:58.370 --> 21:59.870
Wh-Who do you mean?

477
21:59.950 --> 22:02.660
You'll get your souvenir tomorrow.

478
22:03.580 --> 22:04.240
Hey!

479
22:04.240 --> 22:07.000
Stop that Takagi, the water's really cold!
