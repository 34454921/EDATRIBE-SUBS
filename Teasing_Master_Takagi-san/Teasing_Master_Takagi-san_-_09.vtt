00:04.040 --> 00:05.330
The day has come.

2
00:05.470 --> 00:06.980
I've waited so long!

3
00:09.130 --> 00:12.920
And finally, I got my first cell phone!

4
01:48.330 --> 01:50.130
And contact added.

5
01:50.330 --> 01:51.410
Thanks, man.

6
01:51.500 --> 01:52.650
Sure thing.

7
02:01.370 --> 02:02.410
You got a cell phone?

8
02:02.660 --> 02:04.250
Right on cue!

9
02:04.330 --> 02:06.370
Oh cool, you got the latest model?

10
02:06.450 --> 02:08.790
I was thinking of upgrading to that one, myself.

11
02:08.870 --> 02:10.330
Do you mind if I take a look at it?

12
02:10.370 --> 02:11.410
Not at all.

13
02:13.540 --> 02:15.160
Wow. It's lighter than mine.

14
02:15.250 --> 02:16.830
I've been waiting for this!

15
02:16.910 --> 02:20.370
With a cell phone,
I can tease her in all sorts of new ways!

16
02:20.620 --> 02:23.660
Of course, I've got one plan in mind already.

17
02:23.750 --> 02:26.120
You're going' down, Takagi.

18
02:26.200 --> 02:27.080
Ooo.

19
02:27.160 --> 02:29.010
That's a cool feature.

20
02:30.250 --> 02:31.620
Thanks for letting me check it out.

21
02:31.700 --> 02:32.820
No prob.

22
02:42.090 --> 02:42.870
Uhh...

23
02:43.120 --> 02:43.870
Huh?

24
02:44.000 --> 02:45.670
Ah, it's nothing.

25
02:58.340 --> 03:02.100
I thought Takagi was gonna ask me for my email for sure.

26
03:02.290 --> 03:03.540
What now?

27
03:04.160 --> 03:05.040
Something wrong?

28
03:05.120 --> 03:08.200
Huh? Nope!

29
03:08.290 --> 03:09.980
Hmm?

30
03:10.290 --> 03:11.250
Man.

31
03:11.310 --> 03:14.910
If I can't get in touch with
her, I can't execute my plan!

32
03:19.540 --> 03:22.500
Wait a second, why don't I just ask her then?

33
03:22.580 --> 03:23.870
Why didn't I think of that earlier?

34
03:23.950 --> 03:25.420
It's so obvious!

35
03:26.290 --> 03:27.330
Hey, Takagi?

36
03:27.410 --> 03:28.200
What is it?

37
03:28.290 --> 03:29.610
I, uh...

38
03:31.870 --> 03:32.620
Uh...

39
03:33.700 --> 03:35.280
Your email address?

40
03:36.540 --> 03:37.330
Hmm?

41
03:37.410 --> 03:39.730
Never mind, wasn't important!

42
03:41.250 --> 03:42.290
What's going on?

43
03:42.370 --> 03:44.500
Why am I so nervous all of a sudden?

44
03:44.580 --> 03:45.950
Get it together!

45
03:46.040 --> 03:48.740
I'm just trying to get Takagi's email address!

46
03:50.830 --> 03:52.950
I didn't really think about it before.

47
03:53.040 --> 03:55.440
But if I'm asking a girl for her email.

48
03:57.080 --> 03:59.500
Isn't that kinda like...?

49
04:01.120 --> 04:02.250
Yes, it is!

50
04:04.160 --> 04:05.580
Hey, Nishikata.

51
04:05.660 --> 04:08.160
There isn't something you want to ask me, is there?

52
04:08.250 --> 04:09.200
No, not at all!

53
04:09.200 --> 04:11.060
Nope! Not a thing! Really!

54
04:13.950 --> 04:15.660
Hmm...

55
04:15.750 --> 04:16.910
Funny.

56
04:17.000 --> 04:19.700
I was certain you wanted to ask me for my email.

57
04:20.160 --> 04:21.290
She knows!

58
04:21.660 --> 04:22.830
Wait!

59
04:22.910 --> 04:24.410
This might be my chance!

60
04:24.500 --> 04:29.000
All I gotta do is say, "Actually,
you're right," and I'll get exactly what I want!

61
04:29.000 --> 04:30.910
You've grown too careless.

62
04:34.120 --> 04:34.910
Uh.

63
04:35.000 --> 04:36.370
Actually, yeah, you're right.

64
04:36.450 --> 04:38.410
I am? Then why'd you lie about it?

65
04:38.500 --> 04:39.410
Are you embarrassed?

66
04:39.500 --> 04:40.370
Or what?

67
04:40.950 --> 04:41.810
Huh?

68
04:41.810 --> 04:44.290
She found a way to flip this one on me.

69
04:44.370 --> 04:46.080
Uh. Who, me?

70
04:46.160 --> 04:48.450
Embarrassed? No way.

71
04:49.620 --> 04:51.330
Hmm?

72
04:51.410 --> 04:53.200
I think you are.

73
04:53.290 --> 04:55.790
It's just good to have in case something happens.

74
04:55.870 --> 04:57.250
If what happens?

75
04:57.330 --> 04:58.660
I dunno something.

76
04:58.750 --> 05:00.060
So who else did you ask?

77
05:00.060 --> 05:01.780
I'm not the only one, am I?

78
05:02.080 --> 05:03.180
Nah.

79
05:03.660 --> 05:05.640
So far Kimura and Takao.

80
05:06.120 --> 05:07.290
And Nakai.

81
05:07.370 --> 05:09.200
That's all?

82
05:09.290 --> 05:10.790
It's only been a day.

83
05:12.410 --> 05:14.950
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you've figured it out by now.

84
05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
You're the first girl I've asked, whatever!

85
05:17.120 --> 05:19.860
Just hurry up and give it already, this is killing me!

86
05:20.910 --> 05:22.000
So what?

87
05:22.080 --> 05:23.600
Do you want to message me?

88
05:26.580 --> 05:27.540
Of course not!

89
05:27.620 --> 05:31.080
I just want your stupid contact info,
so I can tease you when we're not at school!

90
05:31.080 --> 05:33.250
It has nothing to do with wanting to talk to you!

91
05:33.330 --> 05:34.000
Seriously!

92
05:34.080 --> 05:34.830
That's all!

93
05:34.910 --> 05:37.040
It's nothing weird, I swear!

94
05:45.870 --> 05:48.620
I knew it had to be something like that.

95
05:54.750 --> 05:57.750
Well, your plan to tease me has been thoroughly crushed.

96
05:57.910 --> 05:59.480
Do you still want my email?

97
06:07.040 --> 06:08.080
Yeah.

98
06:10.620 --> 06:12.160
To make up for teasing me.

99
06:12.250 --> 06:14.740
Help me clean up next week when I'm on day duty.

100
06:15.250 --> 06:16.870
I didn't tease you, though!

101
06:16.950 --> 06:18.970
I was going to tease you!

102
06:19.370 --> 06:20.300
Well, yeah.

103
06:20.320 --> 06:22.620
But if I hadn't found out, you would have eventually.

104
06:22.700 --> 06:24.100
Y-Yeah.

105
06:24.450 --> 06:26.230
Then it's a deal.

106
06:29.040 --> 06:30.450
I'll talk to you soon.

107
06:30.540 --> 06:31.550
When I get home.

108
06:37.500 --> 06:39.050
She'll talk to me when she gets home?

109
06:41.500 --> 06:45.250
Does that mean she's gonna
tease me when I'm at home too?

110
06:49.580 --> 06:51.540
I wish I had a cell phone.

111
06:53.200 --> 06:55.630
But I asked my mom if I could get one yesterday

112
06:55.640 --> 06:57.940
and she said I was too young to have a phone.

113
06:58.290 --> 07:00.870
Of course, she'll say no when
you ask her out of the blue.

114
07:00.950 --> 07:02.830
You do say things out of the blue a lot.

115
07:02.910 --> 07:04.750
Hey, that's not true!

116
07:04.830 --> 07:07.620
For your information, I've wanted one forevs.

117
07:07.700 --> 07:09.120
How long is "forevs"?

118
07:09.200 --> 07:10.870
Umm...

119
07:10.950 --> 07:13.360
If I had to put it into words,

120
07:13.620 --> 07:15.540
a week?

121
07:15.620 --> 07:18.910
So in not-Mina time, it's been three days, give or take?

122
07:19.000 --> 07:21.600
Either way, that's still way too sudden.

123
07:23.680 --> 07:25.040
Dude what's up with that picture?

124
07:25.120 --> 07:25.950
It's ridiculous!

125
07:25.980 --> 07:26.960
So dumb!

126
07:26.960 --> 07:28.700
It's Super Ponpoko!

127
07:28.790 --> 07:32.160
Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon! Pon, pon, Po-pon, pon!

128
07:32.250 --> 07:35.460
But there's no denying a lot
of kids have them these days.

129
07:35.910 --> 07:37.450
I guess I kinda want one, too.

130
07:37.540 --> 07:38.620
I know, right?

131
07:38.700 --> 07:40.410
I wish we all had 'em!

132
07:40.500 --> 07:43.540
We should totally all bug our
moms till they buy 'em for us!

133
07:43.620 --> 07:45.750
You want one too, right, Sanae?

134
07:45.830 --> 07:47.500
No. Not really.

135
07:47.580 --> 07:48.250
What?

136
07:48.330 --> 07:49.450
Why the heck not?

137
07:49.540 --> 07:51.340
We could message each other and stuff!

138
07:51.580 --> 07:53.580
Because, hold on,

139
07:54.750 --> 07:56.570
I have one.

140
07:57.120 --> 07:59.080
What? How did that happen?

141
07:59.160 --> 08:02.950
Sometimes I get home late from my club,
so my parents wanted me to have it.

142
08:03.160 --> 08:04.950
That makes sense.

143
08:05.040 --> 08:07.170
Still, you should have told us when you got it.

144
08:07.700 --> 08:08.900
I know!

145
08:09.290 --> 08:12.880
If I tell my parents Sanae has
one, maybe they'll buy one for me!

146
08:12.950 --> 08:14.950
Hey. That's not a bad idea.

147
08:15.040 --> 08:16.160
I'll do the same thing.

148
08:16.250 --> 08:18.250
This time my mom'll agree for sure!

149
08:18.330 --> 08:20.120
Then I can get a group chat going!

150
08:20.200 --> 08:23.480
And I can download tons of games
and play them until I fall asleep!

151
08:24.000 --> 08:25.830
Group chats are the worst

152
08:25.910 --> 08:29.620
That childish attitude is why your
parents don't wanna get you one.

153
08:29.620 --> 08:30.640
I'm not childish!

154
08:30.640 --> 08:31.830
Hit me with a scary story!

155
08:31.910 --> 08:35.000
What, you think not getting
scared means you're not childish?

156
08:35.000 --> 08:36.250
Mm-hmm.

157
08:37.080 --> 08:38.500
Yeah. So what? It's true!

158
08:38.580 --> 08:40.120
Just tell me one, okay?

159
08:41.490 --> 08:42.830
Late one night.

160
08:43.120 --> 08:46.120
You get a call from an unknown number on your new phone.

161
08:46.200 --> 08:48.410
You answer it and hear something soft.

162
08:48.500 --> 08:50.950
A faint groaning of some sort.

163
08:52.090 --> 08:54.410
You quickly hit "end call,"

164
08:54.500 --> 08:56.080
and never hear from that number again.

165
08:56.160 --> 08:56.910
That's goo--

166
08:57.000 --> 08:59.810
But you're just so curious, you have to call back.

167
08:59.950 --> 09:01.540
Why?

168
09:01.620 --> 09:02.560
But this time,

169
09:02.560 --> 09:04.910
you hear nothing on the other end of the line.

170
09:04.950 --> 09:06.720
What a relief.

171
09:07.200 --> 09:08.750
At the end of the month.

172
09:08.830 --> 09:12.680
You look at your phone bill and
find a hundred thousand yen charge.

173
09:14.160 --> 09:16.660
If that happened my parents would kill me!

174
09:18.080 --> 09:20.910
You're gonna kill me if you keep screaming like that!

175
09:31.200 --> 09:34.000
Huh? Good morning, Nishikata.

176
09:34.080 --> 09:35.620
Hey. Morning.

177
09:35.700 --> 09:38.200
I see you decided to keep your promise.

178
09:38.290 --> 09:39.910
I appreciate that.

179
09:40.000 --> 09:41.370
Well, yeah.

180
09:47.370 --> 09:48.410
Let me help.

181
09:48.500 --> 09:50.200
Sure, thank you.

182
09:57.870 --> 10:00.120
You're looking tired today.

183
10:00.450 --> 10:01.290
Really?

184
10:01.370 --> 10:03.250
Guess so.

185
10:03.330 --> 10:04.750
Were you up late again?

186
10:04.830 --> 10:07.580
Watching a recording of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> ?

187
10:07.660 --> 10:09.370
Huh? No!

188
10:09.450 --> 10:11.130
Really?

189
10:11.790 --> 10:12.670
What was it, then?

190
10:13.000 --> 10:14.850
Nothing worth mentioning.

191
10:15.120 --> 10:17.080
Were you messaging some of your friends?

192
10:17.160 --> 10:19.500
Uh. Kinda.

193
10:19.580 --> 10:20.770
What about?

194
10:21.620 --> 10:22.880
That's weird.

195
10:22.880 --> 10:25.660
It's unusual for her to pry into something this much.

196
10:25.750 --> 10:27.490
Wait a second.

197
10:28.950 --> 10:30.160
Fun, right?

198
10:30.250 --> 10:33.450
I mean, messaging your friends when
you get your very first cell phone.

199
10:33.450 --> 10:36.250
Honestly, I was hooked when I got mine, too.

200
10:37.410 --> 10:41.120
And then before you know it,
you end up getting in trouble for doing it too much.

201
10:41.120 --> 10:44.130
Takagi messaged someone enough times to get in trouble?

202
10:44.660 --> 10:46.620
Who does she know that well?

203
10:47.640 --> 10:48.660
Oh yeah?

204
10:48.910 --> 10:50.750
With a girl from class I assume?

205
10:50.830 --> 10:51.610
Nope.

206
10:54.540 --> 10:55.380
Calm down.

207
10:55.390 --> 10:57.860
She's tricked you with something like this before.

208
10:58.870 --> 11:00.980
The last time I rode on the back of someone's bike.

209
11:00.980 --> 11:03.110
I was riding with my dad.

210
11:04.250 --> 11:05.910
I know!

211
11:06.000 --> 11:07.160
Was it your dad?

212
11:07.210 --> 11:09.780
Why would I get in trouble for texting my dad?

213
11:10.830 --> 11:12.180
Touché.

214
11:12.830 --> 11:14.130
Curious?

215
11:14.700 --> 11:16.390
Not really.

216
11:17.910 --> 11:19.750
If you tell me what you chat about with the boys,

217
11:19.760 --> 11:21.830
I'll tell you who I was talking about.

218
11:21.910 --> 11:23.220
Sound like a deal?

219
11:23.910 --> 11:25.480
I don't care that much.

220
11:28.290 --> 11:29.290
Wait...

221
11:29.370 --> 11:31.990
I can kill two birds with one stone.

222
11:32.910 --> 11:36.930
Sorry about this, but your fun stops here, Takagi.

223
11:38.410 --> 11:41.500
Actually, yesterday we were sharing videos.

224
11:41.580 --> 11:44.450
Mostly funny ones,
but there were a couple others mixed in.

225
11:44.540 --> 11:45.660
Hmm?

226
11:45.750 --> 11:46.800
Like what?

227
11:46.980 --> 11:50.710
Yes, yes, by all means, keep taking the bait.

228
11:53.950 --> 11:56.790
I'll send her that link that Kimura sent me.

229
12:12.000 --> 12:13.040
It's thanks to this goat

230
12:13.120 --> 12:14.970
I didn't sleep well last night.

231
12:20.200 --> 12:21.410
Did you send me something?

232
12:21.500 --> 12:22.160
Yeah.

233
12:22.160 --> 12:25.240
It's a video of a cute animal
someone sent me last night.

234
12:25.500 --> 12:27.160
It's not some pervy site, right?

235
12:27.250 --> 12:28.700
Of course not!

236
12:28.790 --> 12:30.790
Huh...

237
12:32.040 --> 12:33.620
Let's see then.

238
12:36.080 --> 12:39.030
It's so scary that you'll be at a loss for words!

239
12:39.200 --> 12:41.000
Just give it a second.

240
12:41.080 --> 12:42.290
Nishikata?

241
12:42.370 --> 12:44.440
Yeah? What's up?

242
12:45.160 --> 12:46.500
Do you like this stuff?

243
12:46.580 --> 12:48.330
Like, do you look at it all the time?

244
12:48.410 --> 12:50.910
Huh? Huh?!

245
12:51.000 --> 12:53.120
Whoa, whoa, hold on, why is that on your phone?

246
12:53.200 --> 12:54.330
What even is that?

247
12:54.410 --> 12:57.500
It's definitely not what I sent you, is it?

248
12:57.690 --> 12:59.000
Nope. Just thought I'd ask.

249
12:59.080 --> 13:00.290
Huh?!

250
13:01.000 --> 13:03.580
Now then, let's take a look-see at what you sent.

251
13:03.670 --> 13:04.530
'Kay?

252
13:05.640 --> 13:08.980
This is pathetic, she got me again!

253
13:10.410 --> 13:13.660
Huh? It is an animal video.

254
13:13.750 --> 13:14.410
Aww.

255
13:14.500 --> 13:15.750
He's kinda cute.

256
13:15.830 --> 13:17.080
Is he a goat?

257
13:17.160 --> 13:19.370
Good, good, she's let her guard down.

258
13:19.450 --> 13:22.000
Here comes the fun part.

259
13:24.540 --> 13:25.580
That's it! That's the part!

260
13:25.660 --> 13:28.040
Cower in fear, Takagi!

261
13:29.160 --> 13:32.080
Oh. Scary.

262
13:32.160 --> 13:33.250
Huh?!

263
13:33.330 --> 13:35.660
Yeah. It is, right?

264
13:35.750 --> 13:36.950
Crazy scary.

265
13:37.040 --> 13:38.950
Yeah, then again.

266
13:39.040 --> 13:42.370
It's not that scary when you watch it in the morning.

267
13:45.410 --> 13:46.980
I'll give her that.

268
13:47.790 --> 13:51.160
Huh... So this is what you guys talk about.

269
13:51.250 --> 13:53.540
Boys are into such weird things.

270
13:53.620 --> 13:55.750
So I held up my end.

271
13:55.830 --> 13:58.120
What did you talk about with who exactly?

272
13:58.200 --> 13:59.500
Mmm...

273
13:59.580 --> 14:01.370
Just the usual stuff.

274
14:01.450 --> 14:04.080
That doesn't answer the question, and you know it!

275
14:04.160 --> 14:05.260
It doesn't?

276
14:05.260 --> 14:08.060
Well, I talk with someone that starts with "Kuh."

277
14:08.190 --> 14:09.200
Heh.

278
14:09.290 --> 14:10.870
That's your clue.

279
14:13.080 --> 14:14.450
"Kuh"?

280
14:14.540 --> 14:15.820
Like, Kaede?

281
14:16.290 --> 14:17.680
Wrong.

282
14:17.890 --> 14:19.700
After that, is "zih."

283
14:19.790 --> 14:20.910
Kuh-zih?

284
14:21.000 --> 14:21.830
Kazi?

285
14:21.910 --> 14:23.540
Wait, Kazi?

286
14:23.620 --> 14:24.700
That boy?

287
14:24.790 --> 14:28.120
No, it's not Kazi, either.

288
14:28.200 --> 14:31.250
But the last bit is "in."

289
14:31.330 --> 14:34.290
Kuh-zih-in?

290
14:36.580 --> 14:37.550
What?

291
14:45.750 --> 14:47.280
Ninety-seven.

292
14:47.750 --> 14:49.310
Ninety-eight.

293
14:50.290 --> 14:51.940
Ninety-nine!

294
14:52.660 --> 14:54.500
Freakin' Takagi.

295
14:54.580 --> 14:57.870
I really thought I'd be able to
get back at her for once, today.

296
14:58.450 --> 15:00.970
But somehow, she outplayed me yet again.

297
15:04.580 --> 15:05.200
No.

298
15:05.250 --> 15:06.640
The day's not over yet.

299
15:08.330 --> 15:11.710
It didn't work in the morning,
but I bet it will at night.

300
15:12.450 --> 15:16.420
There's an even scarier video Kimura
told me about after school today.

301
15:17.450 --> 15:19.940
Since it's scary, I haven't watched it myself.

302
15:20.410 --> 15:23.330
But this will surely freak her ou--

303
15:23.820 --> 15:25.500
How does she always know?

304
15:26.910 --> 15:28.250
Why do I get the feeling

305
15:28.280 --> 15:31.040
I'm gonna have to do more push-ups after this call?

306
15:34.330 --> 15:35.870
Hello? Nishikata?

307
15:35.950 --> 15:36.790
Yeah?

308
15:37.250 --> 15:39.250
I was thinking it's about time.

309
15:39.330 --> 15:41.070
Uh. About time for what?

310
15:41.370 --> 15:43.330
For you to send me a scary video.

311
15:43.410 --> 15:46.220
Huh? I dunno what you're talking about.

312
15:46.500 --> 15:47.910
Huh?

313
15:48.000 --> 15:49.330
Get real, Takagi.

314
15:49.410 --> 15:52.040
You think I'm gonna reveal my plan just like that?

315
15:52.120 --> 15:53.790
This battle is far from over--

316
15:53.870 --> 15:56.880
Just you wait until after we get off the phone.

317
15:57.750 --> 15:59.540
Huh?!

318
15:59.620 --> 16:00.790
That's what you were thinking.

319
16:00.870 --> 16:03.580
What? No. Not me, I wasn't.

320
16:03.660 --> 16:04.750
Really?

321
16:04.830 --> 16:06.950
Yes, of course, really.

322
16:09.910 --> 16:12.250
Then, are you going to go to sleep soon?

323
16:12.330 --> 16:15.100
Uh, yeah. Probably.

324
16:15.910 --> 16:17.190
I see.

325
16:17.620 --> 16:19.940
I was just about to do that, too.

326
16:20.330 --> 16:22.210
Oh. Cool.

327
16:26.410 --> 16:27.920
This feels kind of weird.

328
16:28.290 --> 16:28.910
Huh?

329
16:29.750 --> 16:32.720
I don't think we've ever talked
to each other at night before.

330
16:33.370 --> 16:35.490
Kind of makes my heart flutter.

331
16:37.540 --> 16:38.790
See you tomorrow, then.

332
16:38.870 --> 16:39.370
Good night.

333
16:39.450 --> 16:40.390
Yeah.

334
16:40.790 --> 16:42.450
G'night to you, too.

335
16:49.500 --> 16:50.880
Nishikata?

336
16:51.370 --> 16:52.580
Yeah?

337
16:52.660 --> 16:54.720
You haven't hung up yet.

338
16:55.160 --> 16:56.090
Why not?

339
16:56.700 --> 16:59.250
I dunno, I think you should hang up first.

340
16:59.330 --> 17:00.830
I called you.

341
17:00.910 --> 17:02.390
So you're supposed to hang up.

342
17:03.040 --> 17:04.000
And why's that?

343
17:04.650 --> 17:07.620
Okay, okay, on the count of three.

344
17:07.700 --> 17:08.520
We'll both hang up.

345
17:08.910 --> 17:10.820
One, two...

346
17:13.620 --> 17:15.040
Liar.

347
17:15.500 --> 17:17.000
C'mon, you didn't hang up either!

348
17:35.450 --> 17:38.890
Man. Two nights in a row I can't sleep.

349
17:46.040 --> 17:48.830
Those cats are fighting.

350
17:48.910 --> 17:51.250
Give me like two minutes, Takagi!

351
17:51.830 --> 17:52.750
What are you doing?

352
17:52.830 --> 17:54.750
Good. Just like that.

353
17:54.830 --> 17:57.750
Stay put right there for me, kitty-cats.

354
17:59.660 --> 18:01.570
Yes, that's perfect!

355
18:03.370 --> 18:06.480
Great. Add that to my collection of blurry photos.

356
18:06.480 --> 18:07.410
What's with you?

357
18:07.500 --> 18:09.370
Into photography now?

358
18:10.950 --> 18:12.540
No, not particularly.

359
18:12.620 --> 18:16.430
I'm just competing with the guys to
see who can take the best picture.

360
18:16.870 --> 18:19.290
Has anyone already taken the lead?

361
18:22.540 --> 18:24.410
Yeah, Kimura's unbeatable with this.

362
18:24.500 --> 18:25.910
Whoa!

363
18:26.000 --> 18:28.040
Gotta admire the commitment.

364
18:29.660 --> 18:31.360
Funny pictures are great.

365
18:31.700 --> 18:33.410
Mm-hmm.

366
18:33.500 --> 18:34.950
Wait! I've got an idea!

367
18:35.040 --> 18:37.080
Let me take a picture of that funny face you do!

368
18:37.160 --> 18:38.160
Huh?

369
18:38.250 --> 18:39.950
That can totally beat Super Ponpoko!

370
18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
Help me out!

371
18:41.120 --> 18:42.060
Hmmm...

372
18:42.060 --> 18:45.620
I'll agree on the condition that
you do anything I ask of you.

373
18:45.700 --> 18:47.910
Huh? What kind of "anything"?

374
18:48.000 --> 18:50.700
The word pretty much covers it all.

375
18:52.040 --> 18:53.330
Scary!

376
18:55.200 --> 18:58.330
She has what it takes for me to win, but...

377
18:58.410 --> 19:00.430
Oh. By the way...

378
19:03.370 --> 19:04.800
That's the one!

379
19:10.830 --> 19:11.910
I did the face.

380
19:12.000 --> 19:13.250
That was your chance.

381
19:13.330 --> 19:14.700
Wait! Do it again!

382
19:14.790 --> 19:16.160
No can do.

383
19:16.250 --> 19:19.330
No, it's okay.

384
19:19.410 --> 19:20.160
I know her.

385
19:20.250 --> 19:21.500
She enjoys this too much.

386
19:21.580 --> 19:23.280
She'll want to do it again!

387
19:24.660 --> 19:27.290
I'll just act as though I'm upset to lead her on.

388
19:27.370 --> 19:29.160
Hey, guess what?

389
19:29.250 --> 19:29.870
I knew it!

390
19:29.950 --> 19:31.870
Here's my chance!

391
19:38.620 --> 19:39.370
Really?

392
19:39.450 --> 19:40.700
You had a toy snake on you?

393
19:40.790 --> 19:42.480
That's a great picture.

394
19:42.480 --> 19:45.160
Huh!? Wait, you took my picture?!

395
19:45.250 --> 19:46.790
Hey! Delete that!

396
19:46.870 --> 19:47.870
No way!

397
19:47.950 --> 19:49.290
It's too good!

398
19:50.410 --> 19:51.830
If you do anything I ask,

399
19:51.910 --> 19:53.920
then I'll delete it for you.

400
19:55.410 --> 19:57.040
Come on, Takagi!

401
19:57.120 --> 19:59.090
That was a cheap shot, and you know it!

402
19:59.450 --> 20:02.250
Wow. I got such a great picture.

403
20:02.330 --> 20:03.160
Do you wanna see it?

404
20:03.250 --> 20:05.160
No, I definitely don't.

405
20:05.250 --> 20:06.620
Just look!

406
20:10.410 --> 20:11.660
You had burst mode on?

407
20:11.750 --> 20:13.120
Cool, huh?

408
20:13.200 --> 20:15.230
The way your face changes?

409
20:20.950 --> 20:23.630
Takagi, you're the worst!

410
20:24.790 --> 20:25.830
I know!

411
20:25.910 --> 20:30.500
I'll take a picture of her laughing with
her mouth hanging wide open, just like that!

412
20:30.500 --> 20:33.250
That'll teach her!

413
20:37.080 --> 20:38.260
Do I look okay?

414
20:39.690 --> 20:41.290
Well, we're even now.

415
20:41.370 --> 20:43.690
We're not even close to even!

416
20:45.660 --> 20:49.200
If you want me to delete this shot,
then you gotta delete yours, too.

417
20:49.200 --> 20:50.290
Nuh-uh.

418
20:50.370 --> 20:51.620
I'll keep it.

419
20:51.700 --> 20:54.030
So you don't have to delete my picture, either.

420
20:54.580 --> 20:55.250
Wait.

421
20:55.910 --> 20:57.670
But that's not the point.

422
21:03.120 --> 21:04.250
Well, see ya.

423
21:04.330 --> 21:05.440
Yeah.

424
21:07.290 --> 21:08.960
She had fun.

425
21:09.250 --> 21:12.420
But I didn't get a single
funny picture to show the guys.

426
21:14.910 --> 21:16.030
Hey, Nishikata?

427
21:16.540 --> 21:20.400
Do me a favor, and don't show my picture to anyone.

428
21:21.370 --> 21:23.190
It's embarrassing.

429
21:32.200 --> 21:33.120
Yeah, right.

430
21:33.200 --> 21:35.120
Like I could show this to anyone!

431
21:35.200 --> 21:38.450
What would people say about me having a photo like this?

432
21:38.540 --> 21:39.830
It's not worth keeping!

433
21:39.910 --> 21:40.970
Better delete it.

434
21:46.410 --> 21:48.430
She did say it's embarrassing.

435
21:49.160 --> 21:52.200
So maybe I can use it for some
kind of blackmail one day.

436
21:56.200 --> 21:57.890
Might as well keep it.

437
01:43.020 --> 01:47.020

438
09:23.020 --> 09:27.020
<b>"Horror"</b>

439
17:39.970 --> 17:43.980
<b>"Picture"</b>
