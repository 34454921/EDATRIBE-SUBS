1
00:04.580 --> 00:06.250
If you're ready, hold on tight.

2
00:06.330 --> 00:07.060
Sure.

3
00:10.830 --> 00:12.290
When we first started practicing

4
00:12.370 --> 00:15.750
tandem riding, the hardest part
was Takagi holding on to me.

5
00:27.080 --> 00:29.580
Don't tickle me; you're gonna make us fall over!

6
00:29.660 --> 00:31.130
I wasn't tickling you.

7
00:31.450 --> 00:33.060
I just held on a little.

8
00:35.700 --> 00:38.540
But if you thought I was, your ribs are ticklish.

9
00:38.620 --> 00:41.040
It's just because of how your hands are touching them.

10
00:41.330 --> 00:42.830
Change the way you're holding on.

11
00:43.450 --> 00:44.250
How's this?

12
00:45.620 --> 00:47.700
Don't you think that's a bit too close?

13
00:47.790 --> 00:48.660
No.

14
00:48.750 --> 00:51.450
I'll fall if I'm not close.

15
00:51.540 --> 00:52.330
Oh, come on.

16
00:52.410 --> 00:53.660
Don't get self-conscious.

17
00:54.620 --> 00:56.920
I'm not! I'm just overheating when you're right

18
00:56.930 --> 00:59.210
up against me, it's already a thousand degrees.

19
00:59.410 --> 01:02.330
Anyway, just do me a favor and don't grab on so tight.

20
01:02.410 --> 01:05.230
But you literally told me to hold on tight a minute ago.

21
01:08.500 --> 01:09.530
All right, then.

22
01:09.580 --> 01:11.940
Why don't you just show me how
you want me to hold onto you?

23
01:21.530 --> 01:22.610
Hurry it up.

24
01:22.650 --> 01:24.820
We're gonna run out of time to practice.

25
01:28.950 --> 01:30.980
Uh. I guess something like this works?

26
01:31.600 --> 01:33.910
But now we've overcome our hurdles!

27
01:34.000 --> 01:35.120
And finally...

28
01:42.410 --> 01:44.390
...we've mastered tandem riding.

29
01:45.000 --> 01:45.670
Yeah.

30
01:46.290 --> 01:47.390
Looks like we're done.

31
01:50.620 --> 01:53.620
I mean, we wanted to learn to ride together, and we did.

32
01:53.700 --> 01:55.660
So there's no need to practice anymore.

33
01:55.750 --> 01:58.500
Uh. Mm-hmm.

34
01:58.580 --> 02:02.450
Are you, by any chance, like, kinda bummed?

35
02:02.540 --> 02:04.790
Huh?! I dunno.

36
02:04.870 --> 02:06.500
Relieved, then?

37
02:07.790 --> 02:10.200
It'd be rude to say I'm relieved we're done,

38
02:10.290 --> 02:13.430
but if I say I'm bummed out,
she's just gonna tease me even more.

39
02:14.370 --> 02:16.250
A little bit of both options.

40
02:16.330 --> 02:18.000
Hey. No fair.

41
02:18.080 --> 02:20.160
Well, what about you, huh?

42
02:20.250 --> 02:22.040
What about me?

43
02:22.120 --> 02:25.040
Well, I'd say I'm not that bummed out.

44
02:26.950 --> 02:28.430
Oh, cool.

45
02:35.000 --> 02:37.870
Tomorrow, let's finish up our homework at the library.

46
02:38.370 --> 02:39.830
Huh?

47
02:42.080 --> 02:43.620
We can check each other's work.

48
02:43.700 --> 02:45.210
Uh. Okay.

49
02:49.830 --> 02:51.890
Vacation's ending. Real soon.

50
02:54.330 --> 02:56.820
On the other hand, our next term is starting.

51
02:57.450 --> 02:58.290
Yeah.

52
02:59.870 --> 03:02.220
I wonder when we're actually getting that typhoon.

53
04:45.120 --> 04:47.120
Oh man, it's so windy!

54
04:53.330 --> 04:54.850
Whoa, that's really high!

55
04:55.380 --> 04:56.910
This typhoon is crazy!

56
04:58.250 --> 05:01.160
I don't know why, but I feel really excited!

57
05:03.370 --> 05:06.250
Now wind, blow harder and harder!

58
05:07.620 --> 05:08.790
Perfect timing!

59
05:08.870 --> 05:11.160
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust!

60
05:11.250 --> 05:12.760
So awesome!

61
05:14.250 --> 05:15.160
Now, gale.

62
05:15.250 --> 05:16.910
I command thee...!

63
05:23.950 --> 05:25.950
Morning, Nishikata.

64
05:26.950 --> 05:28.620
Good morning, Takagi.

65
05:28.700 --> 05:30.690
This wind is really something, huh?

66
05:31.000 --> 05:33.290
I probably should have tied my hair back.

67
05:33.370 --> 05:36.000
Uh. Yeah, I bet that would have helped.

68
05:36.870 --> 05:39.650
I was just checking the direction of the wind.

69
05:40.160 --> 05:42.550
You realize I didn't ask what you were doing.

70
05:43.650 --> 05:44.850
Come on!

71
05:44.850 --> 05:48.230
Why does she always have to see
me at the worst possible times?

72
05:48.560 --> 05:50.450
So what were you doing?

73
05:50.450 --> 05:52.540
I just said, I was checking the direction of the wind.

74
05:52.620 --> 05:53.450
Weird.

75
05:53.450 --> 05:55.910
That's not what it looked like to me.

76
05:57.750 --> 06:00.860
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

77
06:01.540 --> 06:03.410
I could have sworn I heard that.

78
06:03.500 --> 06:06.410
Me? No way, that would just be ridiculous.

79
06:06.500 --> 06:09.960
Watching someone else do it makes
me realize how embarrassing it is.

80
06:10.330 --> 06:13.630
So, why were you checking the
direction of the wind, then?

81
06:14.120 --> 06:16.500
I just thought it'd be good to know.

82
06:16.580 --> 06:18.200
Given that the wind's so strong.

83
06:18.290 --> 06:20.500
So I won't fall over!

84
06:20.580 --> 06:21.480
Yeah?

85
06:21.750 --> 06:24.500
But you had both hands raised up so high.

86
06:24.850 --> 06:26.500
Like, "Wow!

87
06:26.580 --> 06:29.250
I feel like I'm controlling this huge gust of wind!

88
06:29.330 --> 06:32.250
So awesome!"

89
06:32.330 --> 06:34.080
I'd bet that's what you were thinking.

90
06:34.160 --> 06:36.080
That's even more embarrassing.

91
06:36.160 --> 06:40.200
By the way, do you notice anything different?

92
06:46.040 --> 06:48.540
You're not riding your bike?

93
06:48.620 --> 06:49.160
That it?

94
06:49.250 --> 06:50.530
Uh-huh.

95
06:51.120 --> 06:52.250
Question is:

96
06:52.330 --> 06:54.330
Why do you think I'm not riding it today?

97
06:54.410 --> 06:55.950
Because there's a typh--

98
06:56.040 --> 06:57.250
If you guess right,

99
06:57.290 --> 06:59.660
I'll keep quiet about your little performance earlier.

100
06:59.750 --> 07:01.000
I won't tell a soul.

101
07:02.320 --> 07:05.040
We've been over this,
I was checking the wind's direction.

102
07:05.870 --> 07:08.120
You have until that plastic bag gets here.

103
07:08.200 --> 07:08.910
Are you serious?

104
07:09.000 --> 07:10.580
I have a time limit?

105
07:10.660 --> 07:12.620
I have no choice but to get this right.

106
07:12.700 --> 07:16.210
She wouldn't be asking such a simple
question if there wasn't a twist.

107
07:16.660 --> 07:20.660
So I can rule out anything obvious like,
"It's dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon."

108
07:22.580 --> 07:24.580
Think. Think!

109
07:24.660 --> 07:27.700
Some other problem that a strong wind would cause.

110
07:27.790 --> 07:28.950
Bike.

111
07:29.040 --> 07:30.250
Wind.

112
07:31.500 --> 07:34.870
Could it be her skirt?

113
07:35.950 --> 07:38.660
Your... Your...

114
07:39.660 --> 07:41.540
I can't bring myself to say that out loud!

115
07:41.620 --> 07:43.040
It's too awkward!

116
07:45.750 --> 07:48.290
And... you are out of time.

117
07:48.370 --> 07:51.910
The correct answer is that it's
dangerous to ride a bike in a typhoon.

118
07:51.910 --> 07:52.830
Sorry!

119
07:52.910 --> 07:53.790
Huh?

120
07:53.870 --> 07:54.750
What?

121
07:54.830 --> 07:56.040
Seriously?

122
07:56.120 --> 07:58.280
You read into things too much.

123
08:00.870 --> 08:01.620
Okay.

124
08:01.680 --> 08:02.880
Let's get going.

125
08:11.540 --> 08:13.370
This wind is so strong.

126
08:13.700 --> 08:14.370
Yeah.

127
08:17.910 --> 08:20.030
Kinda gets you excited, doesn't it?

128
08:20.370 --> 08:24.540
Yeah. I mean, I don't really
know what you're talking about.

129
08:24.620 --> 08:25.910
Hmm?

130
08:26.000 --> 08:27.080
Come on.

131
08:27.160 --> 08:28.910
Doesn't it make you want to shout?

132
08:29.000 --> 08:30.750
Raise your hands to the sky!

133
08:32.160 --> 08:34.290
"Now wind, blow harder and harder!"

134
08:35.450 --> 08:36.540
This sensation!

135
08:36.620 --> 08:39.040
It's like I'm controlling the storm!

136
08:40.540 --> 08:43.950
I am the great Wind King, ruler of this world!

137
08:44.040 --> 08:47.620
I shall blow the school away
to the far ends of the earth!

138
08:50.370 --> 08:52.700
Hey, I never went that far!

139
08:57.790 --> 09:00.080
So you weren't just checking the wind's direction.

140
09:00.160 --> 09:01.290
Uh...

141
09:01.370 --> 09:02.410
Well, whatever.

142
09:04.160 --> 09:05.450
Let's race to school!

143
09:05.540 --> 09:06.510
Hurry up!

144
09:07.830 --> 09:08.790
So strong!

145
09:08.870 --> 09:11.160
Huh? Wait up, Takagi!

146
09:11.250 --> 09:12.500
You always try to get a head start!

147
09:12.500 --> 09:15.580
For some reason,
Takagi was really energetic this morning.

148
09:23.250 --> 09:24.040
All right!

149
09:24.120 --> 09:25.250
Let's do this!

150
09:25.330 --> 09:27.160
How are you so full of energy?

151
09:27.250 --> 09:29.040
I thought you hated marathons.

152
09:29.120 --> 09:29.830
Nah.

153
09:29.910 --> 09:31.330
I'm looking forward to it!

154
09:31.410 --> 09:33.250
In fact, let's race, Sanae!

155
09:33.330 --> 09:34.420
Okay.

156
09:34.700 --> 09:37.910
How about if I win, you don't get to eat any lunch?

157
09:38.000 --> 09:38.950
Yeah.

158
09:39.040 --> 09:40.570
Bring it on!

159
09:40.950 --> 09:42.580
Wait. You sure?

160
09:42.660 --> 09:45.290
You know Sanae is really fast, don't you?

161
09:45.370 --> 09:46.910
Yeah, but I'm in the zone!

162
09:47.000 --> 09:49.160
Uh-huh...

163
09:51.120 --> 09:53.620
What's the point of running a marathon?

164
09:53.700 --> 09:57.790
It's not like we're ever gonna run this
much after we're finished with school.

165
09:57.790 --> 09:59.330
It doesn't make any sense.

166
09:59.410 --> 10:00.660
So lame.

167
10:00.750 --> 10:02.450
You said it, dude.

168
10:03.410 --> 10:05.950
You look enthusiastic, Nishikata.

169
10:08.700 --> 10:09.660
Nishikata.

170
10:13.160 --> 10:14.450
You sure you're up to this?

171
10:14.540 --> 10:16.540
Ha! 'Course I am.

172
10:16.620 --> 10:18.660
It was my idea to begin with.

173
10:18.750 --> 10:19.910
'Kay.

174
10:20.000 --> 10:21.660
See ya later!

175
10:23.830 --> 10:26.250
You and Takagi sure are close.

176
10:26.330 --> 10:27.870
Huh?!

177
10:27.950 --> 10:29.500
Are you going out with her?

178
10:29.580 --> 10:30.900
What are you talking about?

179
10:30.900 --> 10:32.620
Don't get the wrong idea, Kimura!

180
10:32.700 --> 10:36.900
I'm only competing with her because the
winner gets to order the loser around!

181
10:37.040 --> 10:39.920
Wait. You're racing each other in the marathon? But...

182
10:40.040 --> 10:41.600
It's none of your business.

183
10:43.160 --> 10:47.370
Judging by that reaction,
I wouldn't put money on the two of them going out.

184
10:47.370 --> 10:50.200
Yeah, I mean, if they were going out...

185
10:50.290 --> 10:53.000
Nakai! How are you feeling?

186
10:53.080 --> 10:54.120
Pretty darn good!

187
10:54.200 --> 10:57.520
And it's all thanks to you
training with me every single day!

188
10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Let's destroy this marathon!

189
11:00.080 --> 11:01.440
Yeah!

190
11:04.290 --> 11:06.650
They'd be acting something like that.

191
11:07.410 --> 11:09.470
All right, gather 'round!

192
11:11.370 --> 11:14.200
I'll never understand why we have to do this.

193
11:14.290 --> 11:16.620
Just accept it already, Kimura.

194
11:25.330 --> 11:26.920
Empty your mind.

195
11:27.120 --> 11:29.210
Run with an empty mind.

196
11:29.790 --> 11:33.230
Calm yourself and avoid wasting unnecessary energy.

197
11:37.160 --> 11:39.620
I've got you this time, Takagi.

198
11:39.700 --> 11:43.460
I've jogged every evening for
over two weeks just for this day!

199
11:44.770 --> 11:46.500
Come rain.

200
11:46.580 --> 11:48.050
Come wind!

201
11:48.500 --> 11:51.870
There's no way I'm gonna lose after all that prep.

202
11:53.790 --> 11:56.000
Oh! Empty your mind.

203
11:56.080 --> 11:57.790
Empty your mind.

204
11:59.750 --> 12:01.250
Hey, Nishikata!

205
12:02.250 --> 12:05.120
I figured you would have sprinted way ahead of the pack.

206
12:05.200 --> 12:06.320
Oh yeah?

207
12:06.910 --> 12:09.450
Sorry, but pacing yourself is the key.

208
12:09.540 --> 12:11.220
But clearly you don't get it.

209
12:12.120 --> 12:14.410
You look unfazed, but you sped up because you

210
12:14.430 --> 12:16.890
couldn't see me ahead of you and panicked, right?

211
12:17.950 --> 12:18.910
Hmm?

212
12:19.000 --> 12:23.040
I was running slow until now because
I wanted to give you a handicap.

213
12:23.040 --> 12:23.950
Handicap?

214
12:24.040 --> 12:25.860
Wait, did she just read my mind?

215
12:26.290 --> 12:28.200
Well, I'm going on ahead.

216
12:28.410 --> 12:29.790
Huh?

217
12:36.200 --> 12:38.580
I can't have lunch.

218
12:38.660 --> 12:40.480
And I'm already so hungry.

219
12:40.870 --> 12:43.240
I started out too fast.

220
12:43.620 --> 12:44.910
That's right.

221
12:45.000 --> 12:46.040
You'll see, Takagi.

222
12:46.120 --> 12:49.420
If you keep running that fast,
you're gonna lose your pace just like her!

223
12:49.750 --> 12:52.240
And all I have to do is keep up my pace.

224
12:54.080 --> 12:54.960
Wait.

225
12:55.090 --> 12:58.420
But what if Takagi is actually
good at running marathons?

226
12:59.250 --> 13:01.670
If she is, I'm screwed!

227
13:02.560 --> 13:05.250
I don't have the time to empty my mind!

228
13:07.500 --> 13:08.830
Is she already running back?

229
13:08.910 --> 13:11.050
She's that much faster than the boys?

230
13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
I lost my pace, but I caught up.

231
13:26.620 --> 13:28.080
If you manage to touch me,

232
13:28.160 --> 13:30.400
then you can be the winner.

233
13:37.910 --> 13:40.080
I can't touch her in front of all these people!

234
13:40.160 --> 13:42.320
Who knows what they'd think was going on?

235
13:43.080 --> 13:45.220
Takagi, you sneaky little...

236
13:45.770 --> 13:48.770
You deliberately made me lose my pace!

237
13:49.200 --> 13:50.420
Ugh...

238
13:53.950 --> 13:55.200
Takagi.

239
13:55.660 --> 13:57.700
I'll give you a different win condition, too.

240
13:57.790 --> 14:00.290
If you can run 50 meters ahead of
me, the crown is yours!

241
14:00.580 --> 14:01.700
You mean that?

242
14:01.790 --> 14:03.750
Hook, line, and sinker!

243
14:04.580 --> 14:05.830
I hope you're ready!

244
14:05.910 --> 14:08.620
Because I'm gonna destroy your pace this time!

245
14:08.700 --> 14:09.870
You're finished!

246
14:09.950 --> 14:10.660
Cool!

247
14:10.750 --> 14:11.750
I win, then.

248
14:12.140 --> 14:14.220
All the girls are supposed to turn back here.

249
14:14.460 --> 14:15.330
Good luck!

250
14:15.370 --> 14:18.980
You boys still need to run two more kilometers.

251
14:19.370 --> 14:22.290
Oh, that is so not fair, Takagi!

252
14:22.580 --> 14:24.540
That's why I asked if you were sure!

253
14:24.620 --> 14:27.650
We're recording your time Nishikata; don't stop running!

254
14:35.580 --> 14:36.700
What'd I say?

255
14:36.790 --> 14:39.280
Your sides start to hurt and you get hungry.

256
14:39.450 --> 14:44.230
As far as I'm concerned, absolutely nothing
positive comes from running a marathon.

257
14:44.540 --> 14:46.980
If you used all that energy to run instead of

258
14:46.990 --> 14:49.830
complaining, you might be able to go a little faster.

259
14:49.830 --> 14:52.200
Why would I do something so pointless?

260
14:52.290 --> 14:56.160
You really think running is
more pointless than complaining?

261
14:57.000 --> 14:59.250
I just wanna eat lunch.

262
15:00.040 --> 15:01.580
I'm hungry too.

263
15:01.660 --> 15:03.200
I'm starving.

264
15:14.620 --> 15:17.160
Takagi messed with me a ton today.

265
15:17.250 --> 15:18.440
Again.

266
15:18.830 --> 15:19.790
Man.

267
15:19.870 --> 15:21.540
You'll get yours.

268
15:21.870 --> 15:22.830
What's up?

269
15:22.910 --> 15:24.260
Stop staring.

270
15:26.440 --> 15:27.580
I can't get over that.

271
15:27.660 --> 15:29.370
You have such ticklish ribs!

272
15:29.920 --> 15:32.790
She does this every time there's an opportunity.

273
15:32.870 --> 15:34.830
Yeah, sure, my ribs are ticklish.

274
15:34.910 --> 15:35.950
But aren't everybody's?

275
15:36.040 --> 15:37.250
I'm not special.

276
15:38.750 --> 15:40.040
Hey, Takagi.

277
15:40.120 --> 15:40.730
Hmm?

278
15:41.330 --> 15:42.310
Wanna make a bet?

279
15:42.400 --> 15:45.540
I'm thinking whichever one of
us laughs first is the loser.

280
15:45.910 --> 15:47.410
Yeah, why not?

281
15:47.500 --> 15:50.410
If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to start right now.

282
15:50.500 --> 15:51.460
Okay.

283
15:52.120 --> 15:53.620
I've got you now!

284
15:53.700 --> 15:56.660
You have no idea what I've got in store, do you?

285
15:57.370 --> 16:00.160
Looks like both your hands are
occupied holding your bike.

286
16:00.250 --> 16:00.950
Too bad.

287
16:01.040 --> 16:02.340
You're at a disadvantage.

288
16:02.750 --> 16:05.340
If you think you can protect your ribs with only

289
16:05.350 --> 16:07.700
your elbows you've got another thing coming!

290
16:07.700 --> 16:09.200
Oh. By the way,

291
16:09.290 --> 16:13.580
so you know, my ribs happen to not be ticklish.

292
16:16.000 --> 16:17.580
Made you look!

293
16:25.120 --> 16:27.370
Wow. No laugh?

294
16:27.450 --> 16:29.660
That was too close for comfort.

295
16:29.750 --> 16:31.790
And did she say she's not ticklish?

296
16:31.870 --> 16:34.200
That's a bluff if I've ever heard one.

297
16:34.290 --> 16:35.950
She's wide open!

298
16:36.830 --> 16:39.450
Then could she be telling the truth?

299
16:41.250 --> 16:42.370
No.

300
16:42.450 --> 16:46.230
My best option remaining is to just
go for it and find out that way.

301
16:51.120 --> 16:52.410
Is something wrong?

302
16:52.500 --> 16:53.490
Huh?

303
16:53.950 --> 16:57.290
All good. It's, uh, nothing.

304
16:59.000 --> 17:01.620
This is kinda embarrassing.

305
17:01.950 --> 17:04.070
Should I really touch her like that?

306
17:05.000 --> 17:07.450
Wouldn't it be sexual harassment?

307
17:09.120 --> 17:10.310
Hmm?

308
17:11.540 --> 17:13.870
Better hurry up, or I'll get you again.

309
17:13.950 --> 17:14.850
Huh?!

310
17:17.540 --> 17:19.080
What the heck?

311
17:19.160 --> 17:21.410
I thought I had the perfect plan all worked out.

312
17:21.500 --> 17:23.890
How did I not realize it had such a pitfall!

313
17:24.330 --> 17:26.000
It's too risky to go through with.

314
17:26.080 --> 17:29.560
I'll keep my distance and maybe this can end in a draw.

315
17:33.250 --> 17:35.160
Hey.

316
17:41.620 --> 17:44.160
That face isn't fair!

317
17:44.610 --> 17:45.540
I win.

318
17:48.750 --> 17:51.000
I'm really dropping the ball today.

319
17:51.080 --> 17:54.900
I can't believe I forgot that
Takagi makes such good funny faces.

320
17:56.370 --> 18:01.040
Well then, what should I make you do this time?

321
18:01.120 --> 18:03.790
Huh? There's a penalty for the loser?

322
18:03.870 --> 18:05.450
You said, "Wanna make a bet."

323
18:05.540 --> 18:07.160
Of course there is!

324
18:08.540 --> 18:10.240
Now, let's see...

325
18:11.870 --> 18:14.200
You can't eat rice for the rest of your life.

326
18:14.290 --> 18:15.200
Huh?

327
18:15.290 --> 18:17.440
That's brutal!

328
18:17.790 --> 18:20.040
Don't worry, I'm just kidding.

329
18:23.410 --> 18:25.660
You can't read <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

330
18:25.750 --> 18:27.030
Huh?

331
18:28.830 --> 18:30.450
That's pretty cruel, too.

332
18:35.620 --> 18:37.330
Well how about this, then?

333
18:37.410 --> 18:39.280
You have to poke my ribs.

334
18:39.790 --> 18:40.800
Uh?

335
18:43.330 --> 18:45.870
Uhh. Wait, that's my punishment?

336
18:45.950 --> 18:46.940
Mm-hmm.

337
18:47.520 --> 18:48.930
Okay, then.

338
18:54.290 --> 18:55.280
Hmm?

339
18:58.500 --> 18:59.500
That's it!

340
18:59.580 --> 19:01.120
I see what's going' on here!

341
19:01.200 --> 19:04.610
She wants to enjoy me getting
embarrassed and struggling to touch her.

342
19:05.000 --> 19:06.830
Not on my watch!

343
19:08.870 --> 19:09.890
Come to think of it.

344
19:10.410 --> 19:13.200
This might actually be the first
time I've ever touched her.

345
19:13.450 --> 19:15.400
Anywhere but her shoulder, I mean.

346
19:16.450 --> 19:18.580
No, don't think about it.

347
19:18.660 --> 19:19.660
You're just poking her!

348
19:19.750 --> 19:21.570
It's not a big deal!

349
19:22.040 --> 19:23.270
You okay?

350
19:31.790 --> 19:32.500
See?

351
19:32.580 --> 19:33.660
Told you.

352
19:33.750 --> 19:36.290
My ribs aren't ticklish in the slightest.

353
19:36.370 --> 19:37.620
Yeah.

354
19:45.080 --> 19:47.000
My armpits are pretty ticklish, though.

355
19:50.040 --> 19:52.330
I definitely can't touch her there!

356
20:00.870 --> 20:02.290
I totally forgot!

357
20:02.370 --> 20:03.120
About?

358
20:03.200 --> 20:05.040
This is absolutely terrible!

359
20:05.120 --> 20:06.450
What's terrible?

360
20:06.540 --> 20:10.540
We didn't do our test of courage over the summer--ah...

361
20:12.370 --> 20:14.200
Oh yeah, I guess we didn't.

362
20:14.290 --> 20:15.750
Let's do it today after school!

363
20:15.830 --> 20:16.830
We just gotta!

364
20:16.910 --> 20:19.410
Uh, I guess that's okay.

365
20:26.290 --> 20:28.250
You feel that? It's so haunted!

366
20:28.330 --> 20:29.330
Ooooh...

367
20:29.410 --> 20:31.450
Are we really going in there?

368
20:31.540 --> 20:33.870
Yes!

369
20:35.750 --> 20:39.000
They're too excited for this to be a test of courage.

370
20:41.750 --> 20:42.790
It's so dark!

371
20:42.870 --> 20:43.620
Uh-huh.

372
20:43.700 --> 20:45.580
Oh!

373
20:45.660 --> 20:47.250
A hole!

374
20:48.830 --> 20:49.660
Oooh.

375
20:49.750 --> 20:52.000
Huh? A paper talisman!

376
20:52.080 --> 20:53.370
For the spirits!

377
20:53.450 --> 20:54.950
Yeah.

378
20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
Look at that!

379
20:56.120 --> 20:58.120
What's a steel barrel doing in here?

380
20:58.200 --> 20:59.370
Uhh?

381
20:59.450 --> 21:01.330
This isn't scary at all.

382
21:01.410 --> 21:03.370
What? No.

383
21:03.450 --> 21:04.950
It's super scary!

384
21:05.040 --> 21:06.450
Yeah, no.

385
21:11.410 --> 21:13.330
Whoa, look!

386
21:13.410 --> 21:15.000
I found a Frisbee!

387
21:15.080 --> 21:16.000
Lucky!

388
21:16.080 --> 21:17.790
That's weird to find this deep in.

389
21:17.870 --> 21:19.290
It's kinda chilly in here!

390
21:19.370 --> 21:20.870
You think it's a ghost?

391
21:20.950 --> 21:23.160
No, we're just out of the sun
and the wind is blowing through.

392
21:23.250 --> 21:25.580
This is so fun!

393
21:25.660 --> 21:28.370
Oooo!

394
21:28.450 --> 21:31.500
Whaddya doing; don't chase me!

395
21:37.620 --> 21:39.410
Are you happy we did it?

396
21:39.500 --> 21:41.000
Mm-hmm.

397
21:41.830 --> 21:44.870
It was such a classic summer vacation adventure!

398
21:44.950 --> 21:47.290
Sure, whatever that means.

399
21:47.370 --> 21:48.950
But it sucks.

400
21:51.950 --> 21:55.490
Summer vacation isn't coming back any time soon.

401
21:56.410 --> 21:57.260
Yeah.

402
21:58.830 --> 22:01.620
I'm not used to you being so bummed out Mina.

403
22:01.700 --> 22:03.700
Talk about a downer.

404
04:36.020 --> 04:40.030
<b>"Typhoon"</b>

405
09:18.970 --> 09:22.970
<b>"Marathon"</b>

406
15:10.030 --> 15:14.030
<b>"Ribs"</b>

407
19:57.020 --> 20:00.030
<b>"Regret”</b>
