1
00:36.660 --> 00:38.650
A brand new issue.

2
00:40.960 --> 00:42.620
Day-one purchase.

3
00:47.540 --> 00:48.440
Here you go.

4
00:49.070 --> 00:50.260
Thanks, Mom.

5
00:52.750 --> 00:56.420
I have a few stores I want to browse,
so let's meet back here when you're done.

6
00:56.660 --> 00:57.770
Gotcha.

7
00:58.450 --> 01:01.310
And don't get anything too showy, okay?

8
01:02.700 --> 01:03.990
I won't.

9
01:04.180 --> 01:05.970
Thank you, come again.

10
01:06.470 --> 01:10.210
Volume five of <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

11
02:45.330 --> 02:47.910
I wonder what type I should try on first.

12
02:52.040 --> 02:53.660
Hmm...

13
02:55.830 --> 02:57.910
Actually, what type does he like?

14
02:59.790 --> 03:01.330
Hmm...

15
03:05.250 --> 03:08.790
I can't wait to get home and read this cover to cover!

16
03:10.890 --> 03:12.020
Nishikata!

17
03:13.830 --> 03:15.620
What are you doing here?

18
03:15.700 --> 03:16.500
Uh, shopping?

19
03:16.580 --> 03:17.620
Same as you.

20
03:17.700 --> 03:18.800
Again?

21
03:18.800 --> 03:21.910
Why does she always have to show
up at the worst possible time?

22
03:22.000 --> 03:24.950
I swear, she's gotta be following me or something!

23
03:25.040 --> 03:26.080
No.

24
03:26.160 --> 03:28.290
Now's not the time to think about that.

25
03:28.370 --> 03:32.420
I need to focus my energy into making
sure she doesn't find out what I bought.

26
03:33.540 --> 03:36.330
Anyway, I saw you leaving the bookstore.

27
03:36.350 --> 03:37.250
Here it comes!

28
03:37.330 --> 03:39.040
Gotta think quick!

29
03:39.120 --> 03:40.130
Did you buy something--?

30
03:40.130 --> 03:43.040
So you're shopping? That's cool! Whatcha getting?

31
03:46.040 --> 03:47.840
That was too close a call.

32
03:48.120 --> 03:51.140
I hope changing the subject is
enough to get out of this alive.

33
03:52.540 --> 03:54.950
Mainly, a bathing suit.

34
04:00.330 --> 04:01.460
A bathing suit?

35
04:04.410 --> 04:05.520
Are you blushing?

36
04:05.520 --> 04:07.340
No, it's just hot in here!

37
04:08.080 --> 04:08.850
Hey.

38
04:09.830 --> 04:12.540
What kind of girl's bathing
suit do you think looks best?

39
04:12.620 --> 04:15.330
Uh, what kind of...? Why you asking me?

40
04:15.410 --> 04:18.560
I-I don't know, they're all probably fine.

41
04:18.870 --> 04:19.830
You've seen 'em all?

42
04:19.910 --> 04:21.290
You're quite the connoisseur.

43
04:21.370 --> 04:22.540
No, you don't get it!

44
04:22.620 --> 04:24.040
I mean that I couldn't care less!

45
04:24.040 --> 04:26.080
I'm not some expert!

46
04:26.160 --> 04:26.950
Hot in here?

47
04:27.040 --> 04:29.160
Yes, it's hot in here.

48
04:29.250 --> 04:34.200
Typical. Of course, she messes with
me the second we bump into each other.

49
04:34.870 --> 04:37.290
All right, I'm gonna go home now.

50
04:37.370 --> 04:38.830
'Kay.

51
04:38.910 --> 04:41.700
At least, I was able to hide the manga from her.

52
04:41.790 --> 04:44.330
You just bought the new volume
of <i>Unrequited Love,</i> right?

53
04:44.410 --> 04:45.580
Could I borrow it?

54
04:46.950 --> 04:48.250
I was so close!

55
04:48.330 --> 04:50.120
Was she watching me?

56
04:52.480 --> 04:55.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
04:55.160 --> 04:57.410
You don't? Was I wrong?

58
04:57.500 --> 04:59.550
Hey, wait.

59
05:00.160 --> 05:04.000
There's no way she could have seen from
outside with the register where it is.

60
05:05.620 --> 05:07.380
She's bluffing.

61
05:09.580 --> 05:11.030
Dodged a bullet there.

62
05:11.870 --> 05:13.200
Yeah, totally wrong.

63
05:13.290 --> 05:14.830
You couldn't be more off.

64
05:14.910 --> 05:15.790
Oh yeah?

65
05:15.870 --> 05:17.460
Then what did you buy?

66
05:19.410 --> 05:21.410
Uh, <i>Robot Zombie</i> ?

67
05:30.080 --> 05:32.120
Yeah, sure, whatever, that!

68
05:32.200 --> 05:34.620
It's like, the last thing a girl would be interested in!

69
05:34.700 --> 05:36.830
It's way too ridiculous!

70
05:38.580 --> 05:39.700
Yeah, right.

71
05:39.790 --> 05:41.660
You bought <i>Unrequited Love,</i> didn't you?

72
05:41.750 --> 05:43.330
Yup! Sure did!

73
05:43.410 --> 05:44.910
Gah!

74
05:45.000 --> 05:47.450
N-No.

75
05:47.540 --> 05:49.200
Let me see it, then.

76
05:50.660 --> 05:53.660
Man. She backed me into a corner again.

77
05:54.680 --> 05:56.410
This is what always happens.

78
05:56.500 --> 06:00.160
No matter what I do,
I can never beat Takagi at her own game.

79
06:03.000 --> 06:05.590
Wait, I take that back.

80
06:06.540 --> 06:10.750
Okay, but first, shall we make a bet?

81
06:10.830 --> 06:12.000
Hmm?

82
06:12.910 --> 06:17.470
We can bet on whether or not the book
I bought is <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

83
06:18.750 --> 06:21.000
I say our usual condition applies.

84
06:21.080 --> 06:24.290
If you're wrong, you have to do whatever I tell you to.

85
06:24.440 --> 06:25.650
Fine with me.

86
06:25.680 --> 06:28.580
And if I get it right, then you do whatever I want.

87
06:28.660 --> 06:29.950
Yeah, okay.

88
06:31.290 --> 06:34.330
So, then what is it you think I purchased?

89
06:34.410 --> 06:35.500
Heh.

90
06:35.580 --> 06:37.540
It's all in the presentation.

91
06:37.620 --> 06:39.780
It's your move, Takagi.

92
06:40.120 --> 06:43.790
I'm sure my level of confidence will
have you second guessing yourself.

93
06:43.790 --> 06:44.540
Huh?

94
06:44.670 --> 06:47.840
Nishikata sounds so much more confident than normal.

95
06:48.250 --> 06:51.540
Maybe it's actually not <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

96
06:53.100 --> 06:56.260
Oh yeah. If she's gonna find out anyway,

97
06:56.260 --> 06:58.960
I might as well teach her a lesson in the process.

98
06:59.360 --> 07:01.410
Think you can just get me like that again?

99
07:01.500 --> 07:03.410
Nuh-uh. I've learned.

100
07:03.500 --> 07:04.540
Know what?

101
07:04.620 --> 07:06.580
I'm gonna bet that it's <i>Unrequited Love.</i>

102
07:06.600 --> 07:07.870
Huh?

103
07:08.330 --> 07:10.500
Y-You sure about that?

104
07:10.580 --> 07:11.510
Mm-hmm.

105
07:13.870 --> 07:14.860
Let's see it.

106
07:21.410 --> 07:22.540
Awesome!

107
07:22.620 --> 07:23.810
I got it right!

108
07:26.620 --> 07:29.160
I don't know how she saw through me that time.

109
07:29.250 --> 07:31.080
I should just go home and read this.

110
07:31.160 --> 07:32.870
That'll make me feel better.

111
07:33.750 --> 07:35.750
Ugh. I'll see yah around.

112
07:35.750 --> 07:37.620
Where do you think you're going?

113
07:40.000 --> 07:40.950
Help me out.

114
07:41.040 --> 07:43.120
I need a bathing suit.

115
07:47.410 --> 07:48.540
We said if I won.

116
07:48.620 --> 07:51.420
I'd get to tell you what to do, didn't we?

117
07:51.580 --> 07:54.060
I have to help her pick one?

118
07:54.450 --> 07:55.160
Hot in here?

119
07:55.250 --> 07:56.670
Yes, it's still hot!

120
08:07.540 --> 08:09.450
Which one do you like most?

121
08:11.730 --> 08:14.410
Uh. They all look nice to me.

122
08:14.830 --> 08:16.830
Will you actually look and pick one?

123
08:16.910 --> 08:18.620
You did lose our bet.

124
08:21.200 --> 08:23.910
I don't think she realizes what she's asking of me.

125
08:23.910 --> 08:25.450
It's embarrassing just being here!

126
08:25.540 --> 08:27.950
I can't look directly at the bathing suits!

127
08:28.040 --> 08:31.200
Oh. Check it out.

128
08:31.290 --> 08:33.620
What do you think of this one?

129
08:34.750 --> 08:38.300
I guess I just have to pick one
if I want to get this over with.

130
08:38.560 --> 08:41.370
I-I think that one's nice.

131
08:41.450 --> 08:42.870
Oh?

132
08:42.950 --> 08:47.040
In that case, I might as well try it on.

133
08:47.250 --> 08:48.280
Huh?

134
08:48.880 --> 08:50.080
Stay right there.

135
08:50.160 --> 08:52.040
I'll only be a minute.

136
08:53.620 --> 08:54.950
What am I doing?

137
08:55.040 --> 08:57.360
How did I end up in this situation?

138
08:58.500 --> 09:00.950
Right now, just beyond that curtain.

139
09:01.040 --> 09:05.540
Takagi is taking off her...

140
09:11.610 --> 09:13.040
How's it look?

141
09:15.250 --> 09:16.750
I dunno, fine?

142
09:16.830 --> 09:17.600
That's all?

143
09:18.200 --> 09:19.840
I'll try on another, then.

144
09:20.620 --> 09:22.100
You mean you're not done?

145
09:23.120 --> 09:25.330
Until you tell me I look good in one.

146
09:25.410 --> 09:26.560
No, I'm not.

147
09:28.100 --> 09:30.520
Huh? Tell her she looks good?

148
09:30.600 --> 09:32.960
That's way too embarrassing for me to say!

149
09:36.160 --> 09:37.700
Hey, Nishikata.

150
09:39.080 --> 09:42.000
Sorry, can you hand me that bathing suit?

151
09:42.080 --> 09:42.690
Huh?!

152
09:42.690 --> 09:44.830
The yellow one I was looking at.

153
09:47.430 --> 09:50.910
She's covering herself, does that mean?

154
09:51.000 --> 09:52.820
It's to the left of that one.

155
09:53.120 --> 09:54.430
Uh-huh, that's it.

156
09:54.580 --> 09:56.450
Just a few feet to my right.

157
09:56.540 --> 09:58.480
She's totally naked.

158
10:12.620 --> 10:13.770
Sorry again.

159
10:22.040 --> 10:23.660
Thanks a bunch.

160
10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
Oh, gimme a break!

161
10:29.290 --> 10:31.860
That was totally on purpose!

162
10:32.410 --> 10:36.130
But forget that, I need to get out
of this store as soon as possible.

163
10:36.250 --> 10:38.660
If someone from school sees me here with Takagi,

164
10:38.750 --> 10:40.330
I'll never hear the end of it.

165
10:41.450 --> 10:42.950
Wow, there are so many!

166
10:48.450 --> 10:50.720
All right! How's this one?

167
10:52.500 --> 10:53.650
Uh.

168
10:55.040 --> 10:57.170
Oh. Hi, Takagi!

169
10:57.620 --> 10:59.000
Hey, Mano!

170
11:00.760 --> 11:02.690
Hey, Nakai.

171
11:03.290 --> 11:05.440
Uh, hey, what's going' on?

172
11:06.500 --> 11:08.120
You're here to get a bathing suit?

173
11:08.200 --> 11:10.450
Yeah, I assume that's why you're here, too?

174
11:10.540 --> 11:11.690
Ow...

175
11:12.330 --> 11:14.640
Hey, Mano, it's embarrassing being here.

176
11:14.640 --> 11:16.020
Can we hurry it up already?

177
11:16.250 --> 11:19.490
Wha?! We've barely been here five minutes!

178
11:20.120 --> 11:22.700
If I rush, I might miss something I'd really like!

179
11:23.290 --> 11:24.480
Hmm?

180
11:39.250 --> 11:40.970
How 'bout we come back later?

181
11:41.160 --> 11:42.620
What? But you said--

182
11:42.700 --> 11:44.200
It doesn't matter.

183
11:44.290 --> 11:45.930
See you later, Takagi!

184
11:46.160 --> 11:47.100
'Kay!

185
11:58.870 --> 12:00.830
Don't worry, the coast is clear.

186
12:00.910 --> 12:02.250
They're gone.

187
12:02.330 --> 12:04.500
Oh. Is that so?

188
12:05.290 --> 12:07.120
You get so shy sometimes

189
12:07.200 --> 12:07.870
What do you mean?

190
12:07.950 --> 12:09.120
No I don't.

191
12:09.830 --> 12:11.080
Well then.

192
12:11.160 --> 12:13.440
Back to trying on more, I assume.

193
12:14.950 --> 12:17.700
We should probably hurry up and pick one of these out.

194
12:19.540 --> 12:21.910
Otherwise, you'll die of embarrassment.

195
12:22.000 --> 12:23.930
Oh, shut up. I'm fine.

196
12:26.160 --> 12:27.210
So...

197
12:28.040 --> 12:29.750
...which of these do you like better?

198
12:29.830 --> 12:32.790
Uh. I dunno, whichever you like, I guess?

199
12:32.870 --> 12:34.750
Then how about this one here?

200
12:35.450 --> 12:37.010
Think this one's good?

201
12:39.950 --> 12:40.850
Uh-huh.

202
12:41.230 --> 12:43.200
I keep coming back to this pink one.

203
12:43.290 --> 12:44.620
Do you think it's good too?

204
12:44.700 --> 12:45.740
Uh-huh.

205
12:46.000 --> 12:47.410
And this one-piece?

206
12:47.830 --> 12:49.080
Mm-hm.

207
12:49.160 --> 12:51.120
Wanna go swimming together sometime?

208
12:51.580 --> 12:52.500
Uh-huh.

209
12:55.700 --> 12:57.090
It's a date.

210
13:01.080 --> 13:02.910
Okay.

211
13:03.000 --> 13:05.080
I'll buy you something to drink later.

212
13:05.160 --> 13:06.370
You're burning up again.

213
13:06.450 --> 13:08.500
Yeah, I mean, it is super-hot in here!

214
13:08.580 --> 13:10.950
They should really fix the air conditioning!

215
13:15.120 --> 13:16.370
The ocean!

216
13:16.450 --> 13:18.530
We swimming' or what?

217
13:19.330 --> 13:21.410
Of course we are, come on!

218
13:27.120 --> 13:28.540
Water.

219
13:36.160 --> 13:38.370
We got the waves!

220
13:38.450 --> 13:40.620
We got the sun!

221
13:40.700 --> 13:42.380
We got the seaweed.

222
13:42.660 --> 13:45.870
Stop Sanae. It's all gross and slimy!

223
13:48.370 --> 13:50.370
What are you doing, Yukari?

224
13:53.290 --> 13:55.370
What does it look like I'm doing?

225
13:55.450 --> 13:57.330
I'm pumping air into this.

226
13:57.410 --> 13:58.540
But we're at the beach.

227
13:58.620 --> 14:00.540
You should at least go for a swim, first.

228
14:00.620 --> 14:03.620
I wouldn't be doing this if I
could just jump in the water.

229
14:06.660 --> 14:09.580
Ah! What, you can't swim?

230
14:11.620 --> 14:13.450
You do sit out during swim lessons.

231
14:13.540 --> 14:15.370
Though you'd probably learn if you didn't.

232
14:15.450 --> 14:16.500
Whatever.

233
14:16.580 --> 14:18.500
Just go have fun, I'll be there soon.

234
14:18.580 --> 14:20.580
Shoo. Shoo.

235
14:36.080 --> 14:37.870
Ah! That was fun, but I'm wiped!

236
14:37.950 --> 14:40.290
Yeah, let's take a break for now.

237
14:40.370 --> 14:41.790
Huh?

238
14:44.640 --> 14:45.580
What happened?

239
14:45.660 --> 14:47.500
You okay, Yukari?

240
14:47.580 --> 14:48.700
Yeah, I'm okay.

241
14:48.790 --> 14:51.620
But I managed to break the pump somehow.

242
14:51.700 --> 14:55.160
So I was blowing it up on my own, and I got winded.

243
14:59.290 --> 15:02.280
Man, Yukari, do you ever have
fun, or do you just suffer?

244
15:02.790 --> 15:04.570
You don't know my life!

245
15:05.000 --> 15:08.330
And just for that, I'm not gonna
help you with your homework anymore!

246
15:08.500 --> 15:10.160
Hope you can do it on your own!

247
15:10.250 --> 15:11.120
You what?

248
15:11.200 --> 15:12.160
But I can't!

249
15:12.250 --> 15:13.080
Please have mercy!

250
15:13.160 --> 15:15.450
I won't make fun of you anymore!

251
15:15.540 --> 15:17.500
Crying won't get you anywhere.

252
15:25.660 --> 15:29.040
Nishikata, are you making
progress on your summer homework?

253
15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Uh...

254
15:30.120 --> 15:31.160
Yeah.

255
15:31.250 --> 15:33.880
I guess you could say that.

256
15:34.410 --> 15:35.830
Oh?

257
15:35.910 --> 15:39.500
Hey, wanna do our homework together?

258
15:39.580 --> 15:42.700
Uh. Yeah, sure, that's cool.

259
15:42.790 --> 15:44.290
But I have plans in the afternoon.

260
15:44.370 --> 15:45.290
That's fine.

261
15:45.370 --> 15:47.950
Let's just work on it until noon.

262
15:49.790 --> 15:52.000
You can copy my answers.

263
15:52.080 --> 15:53.410
Huh?

264
15:53.500 --> 15:55.250
Okay, then where should we do it?

265
15:55.330 --> 15:56.290
At the library?

266
15:56.370 --> 15:59.770
Or, wait. We wouldn't have very
much time to get our stuff, then.

267
16:00.580 --> 16:02.360
You're over-thinking this.

268
16:02.910 --> 16:05.180
We could just go over to your house.

269
16:18.000 --> 16:19.680
What is my life?

270
16:20.080 --> 16:22.110
Out of nowhere, Takagi,

271
16:22.580 --> 16:25.040
a girl is coming to my room!

272
16:25.950 --> 16:27.060
Are we going in?

273
16:27.910 --> 16:29.870
Sorry. Spaced out for a sec.

274
16:33.700 --> 16:35.160
This place is nice.

275
16:35.250 --> 16:37.200
You don't have to be polite.

276
16:37.290 --> 16:39.870
My parents aren't here anyway.

277
16:44.700 --> 16:46.200
This feels like a dream.

278
16:46.290 --> 16:47.460
Is this a dream?

279
16:48.000 --> 16:50.450
Takagi is actually in my room.

280
16:50.910 --> 16:52.780
It feels so surreal.

281
16:54.200 --> 16:55.650
What's wrong?

282
16:56.750 --> 16:58.450
You spaced out again.

283
16:59.160 --> 17:00.040
Oh.

284
17:00.830 --> 17:02.020
It's nothing!

285
17:04.910 --> 17:05.700
Hey!

286
17:05.790 --> 17:07.620
It's your favorite girl's manga!

287
17:08.500 --> 17:11.910
Aww, you found me! Squeal!

288
17:12.000 --> 17:13.870
You have every volume!

289
17:13.950 --> 17:14.500
Huh?!

290
17:14.580 --> 17:15.860
Don't touch that!

291
17:19.160 --> 17:20.690
S-Sorry.

292
17:21.660 --> 17:23.370
Why are you apologizing?

293
17:23.450 --> 17:25.730
Well, you know, because we were just so--

294
17:26.250 --> 17:27.630
You like this, right?

295
17:30.580 --> 17:33.010
If you like something, you should just admit it.

296
17:33.250 --> 17:34.750
What does she mean?

297
17:34.830 --> 17:36.540
"This" as in her being in my room?

298
17:36.620 --> 17:38.770
How am I supposed to respond to that?

299
17:39.750 --> 17:41.790
Maybe this is a dream after all!

300
17:42.340 --> 17:44.670
<i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

301
17:46.160 --> 17:47.750
You do like it, right?

302
17:47.830 --> 17:49.620
There's really no need to hide it.

303
17:49.700 --> 17:51.970
That's what she was talking about?

304
17:55.450 --> 17:57.370
Now that I've had a chance to look around,

305
17:57.450 --> 17:59.340
this room just screams "you."

306
17:59.580 --> 18:02.160
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

307
18:04.080 --> 18:05.980
Hmm...

308
18:06.790 --> 18:08.580
No, not exactly.

309
18:10.950 --> 18:12.740
But either way, I like it.

310
18:18.080 --> 18:20.020
W-Want to start our homework?

311
18:20.500 --> 18:21.660
Read my mind!

312
18:23.540 --> 18:24.250
Oh right.

313
18:24.330 --> 18:26.250
But I only have one desk.

314
18:26.870 --> 18:29.000
Do you have a folding table or something?

315
18:29.080 --> 18:32.240
Yeah, but they're all being used in different rooms.

316
18:32.750 --> 18:34.040
Too bad.

317
18:34.120 --> 18:36.340
Then should we sit in the same chair?

318
18:38.370 --> 18:39.490
Uh...

319
18:40.540 --> 18:41.080
Huh?!

320
18:42.450 --> 18:44.060
I'm just messing around.

321
18:44.370 --> 18:45.860
Oh, I know.

322
18:53.700 --> 18:56.050
We could use your bed.

323
18:57.570 --> 19:00.080
Uh. Um.

324
19:01.080 --> 19:02.250
Move this.

325
19:02.330 --> 19:04.970
And we've basically got one big desk right here!

326
19:07.290 --> 19:09.120
You okay?

327
19:09.200 --> 19:10.490
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

328
19:10.790 --> 19:12.050
Good idea.

329
19:12.660 --> 19:13.660
Ohh?

330
19:13.750 --> 19:14.680
What's the problem?

331
19:14.680 --> 19:15.410
Lay off.

332
19:15.750 --> 19:16.870
No problem.

333
19:16.950 --> 19:17.910
Come on.

334
19:18.000 --> 19:19.170
Let's start.

335
19:19.870 --> 19:22.080
Wait, I'm sitting there, too?

336
19:27.790 --> 19:29.080
So, hey, uh...

337
19:29.160 --> 19:31.080
Remember what you said about your answers?

338
19:31.160 --> 19:33.940
Of course, they are right here.

339
19:34.620 --> 19:36.260
Awesome, thanks a ton!

340
19:36.870 --> 19:38.580
Though, I only grabbed these.

341
19:38.660 --> 19:40.150
Kanji writing drills.

342
19:42.290 --> 19:44.250
That's so not fair; you tricked me!

343
19:44.330 --> 19:45.700
No, I didn't.

344
19:52.120 --> 19:52.950
That's enough.

345
19:53.010 --> 19:53.860
Let's work.

346
19:59.670 --> 20:00.430
Wait.

347
20:00.660 --> 20:02.540
If we're just practicing kanji,

348
20:02.620 --> 20:05.400
was there ever any reason to do our homework together?

349
20:25.250 --> 20:29.220
Oh no! I saw this exact thing on <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> !

350
20:30.040 --> 20:34.320
Jeez. I don't know why I have to make
curry with this jerk of all people!

351
20:35.040 --> 20:37.200
He makes me so mad!

352
20:43.080 --> 20:45.700
Um. You can let go of my hand now.

353
20:45.790 --> 20:48.530
Why would I want to do something like that?

354
20:48.830 --> 20:49.660
C'mere.

355
20:49.750 --> 20:50.950
Let me see that face.

356
20:51.040 --> 20:53.160
Squeal!

357
20:55.120 --> 20:56.720
I can't do that!

358
20:57.580 --> 20:58.450
You can use it.

359
20:58.540 --> 21:00.590
It is your eraser, after all.

360
21:01.250 --> 21:02.480
That's my bad.

361
21:03.120 --> 21:05.280
Uh. Okay.

362
21:07.160 --> 21:08.070
Your hand.

363
21:08.330 --> 21:09.660
Sorry!

364
21:09.750 --> 21:11.860
You want something' to drink?

365
21:12.370 --> 21:12.950
Like tea?

366
21:13.040 --> 21:13.870
You want tea?

367
21:13.950 --> 21:14.610
Mm-hmm.

368
21:16.370 --> 21:18.370
Coming' right up!

369
21:42.040 --> 21:43.450
Thanks for having me.

370
21:43.540 --> 21:45.540
All she did was mess with me.

371
21:45.920 --> 21:46.870
I think.

372
21:47.080 --> 21:47.800
Bye!

373
21:48.000 --> 21:49.120
I'll come again.

374
21:54.910 --> 21:55.830
Huh?

375
21:55.910 --> 21:57.950
She'll come again?

376
22:02.080 --> 22:05.140
Maybe... I should clean my room.

377
00:43.210 --> 00:47.210
<b>"Shopping"</b>

378
07:58.060 --> 08:02.060
<b>"Bathing Suit"</b>

379
13:32.060 --> 13:36.060
<b>"Ocean"</b>

380
16:10.840 --> 16:14.640
<b>"Room"</b>
