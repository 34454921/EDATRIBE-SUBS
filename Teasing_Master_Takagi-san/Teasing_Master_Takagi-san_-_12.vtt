00:32.950 --> 00:34.720
Sanae!

2
00:35.370 --> 00:37.010
Here! For you.

3
00:38.700 --> 00:41.120
Uh... A love letter?

4
00:41.200 --> 00:43.500
Of course not! It's just a regular letter!

5
00:43.580 --> 00:45.330
Everyone's writing them to their friends these days!

6
00:45.410 --> 00:46.750
Haven't you noticed?

7
00:46.830 --> 00:47.790
No.

8
00:49.370 --> 00:51.750
Don't you worry, Yukari,
I'm gonna write one for you too.

9
00:51.830 --> 00:54.290
That's nice of you, just don't do it in class.

10
00:54.370 --> 00:55.790
You need to focus on the lesson.

11
00:55.870 --> 00:58.470
Friendship is way more important than any lesson.

12
00:58.950 --> 01:01.910
What, are the girls all suddenly
into writing letters now?

13
01:02.000 --> 01:03.450
That's what it looks like.

14
01:03.540 --> 01:05.950
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

15
01:07.370 --> 01:09.700
Maybe. They do seem really into it.

16
01:09.790 --> 01:10.910
I'll say.

17
01:11.000 --> 01:12.430
Love letters, huh?

18
01:12.790 --> 01:14.160
I don't get the appeal.

19
01:14.250 --> 01:15.910
They could just say what they want out loud.

20
01:16.000 --> 01:17.790
Why bother to write it all down?

21
01:17.870 --> 01:19.620
Must have a lotta time on their hands.

22
01:27.330 --> 01:29.160
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

23
01:29.250 --> 01:31.700
Sanae, you're going a little overboard.

24
01:31.790 --> 01:33.500
One kick was enough.

25
01:33.580 --> 01:35.500
So kicking him at all's okay?

26
01:37.660 --> 01:39.700
All right, let's start class.

27
01:39.790 --> 01:42.330
Open up your textbooks to page seventy-six.

28
01:48.370 --> 01:49.950
Takagi's writing letters, too?

29
01:52.620 --> 01:55.700
Sometimes I forget that she's just your ordinary girl.

30
02:11.700 --> 02:12.660
What?

31
03:52.450 --> 03:53.950
Is there something wrong, Nishikata?

32
03:55.410 --> 03:57.330
No, nothing, everything's great!

33
03:57.410 --> 03:59.580
A letter? Who's it from?

34
03:59.660 --> 04:01.080
And why me?

35
04:01.160 --> 04:03.910
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

36
04:04.000 --> 04:06.290
No, no, no, that's obviously not it!

37
04:06.370 --> 04:08.160
Someone's playing a prank on me.

38
04:08.250 --> 04:09.250
Oh, yeah!

39
04:11.540 --> 04:13.910
This could be Takagi's doing.

40
04:14.000 --> 04:15.620
No, it's gotta be her!

41
04:17.910 --> 04:19.620
Takagi--

42
04:19.700 --> 04:20.700
Wait a second.

43
04:20.790 --> 04:22.080
Reign it in, Nishikata!

44
04:22.160 --> 04:24.500
What if it's somebody else? What if it isn't Takagi?

45
04:24.660 --> 04:27.860
If she finds out I got a letter,
she'll just use that to tease me again!

46
04:28.750 --> 04:30.160
Yeah? What is it?

47
04:30.250 --> 04:31.580
Uh...

48
04:31.660 --> 04:32.870
Oh, uh...

49
04:38.290 --> 04:39.580
I was just thinking.

50
04:39.660 --> 04:41.040
It's nice out.

51
04:41.120 --> 04:42.450
Are you hiding something?

52
04:43.910 --> 04:45.760
Why would I be hiding something?

53
04:46.410 --> 04:47.660
Hmm...

54
04:47.760 --> 04:50.160
Dunno. But you're suspicious.

55
04:50.700 --> 04:51.700
And blushing, too.

56
04:51.760 --> 04:54.370
You're just imagining things.

57
04:54.450 --> 04:56.040
Well, maybe.

58
04:56.120 --> 04:58.290
But why is your textbook closed?

59
04:58.370 --> 05:01.160
Well. You see, I uh...

60
05:01.250 --> 05:03.750
I bet it's why your face is red.

61
05:03.830 --> 05:06.160
No, it's not! And my face is not red!

62
05:07.120 --> 05:08.830
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

63
05:08.910 --> 05:10.370
Yes, that's why I said so!

64
05:14.160 --> 05:16.080
I guess I was imagining things.

65
05:18.580 --> 05:20.980
By the way, that letter in your textbook.

66
05:21.620 --> 05:22.830
I put that there.

67
05:25.790 --> 05:26.950
I knew it!

68
05:30.750 --> 05:31.790
Yeah. I knew that.

69
05:31.870 --> 05:34.160
I mean, duh. It was obvious.

70
05:34.250 --> 05:36.580
You liar.

71
05:36.660 --> 05:38.370
What are you talking about? I'm not lying.

72
05:38.450 --> 05:41.000
I was just having fun making you squirm.

73
05:41.080 --> 05:43.370
So. You gonna read what's inside?

74
05:43.450 --> 05:45.200
You wrote something?

75
05:45.290 --> 05:46.540
Well, it is a letter.

76
05:49.370 --> 05:51.950
You're just messing with me like always, aren't you?

77
05:55.410 --> 05:57.610
Why aren't you saying something?

78
05:57.910 --> 05:59.620
Okay.

79
05:59.700 --> 06:01.910
I'll read it at home later.

80
06:02.000 --> 06:03.490
Read it now.

81
06:04.330 --> 06:05.620
What? Why now?

82
06:06.120 --> 06:09.120
Because. School's over after this period.

83
06:09.370 --> 06:11.160
And I wanted an answer by then.

84
06:11.250 --> 06:12.660
An answer?

85
06:16.330 --> 06:20.160
If it's a letter that needs an answer,
then it's a letter asking a question.

86
06:20.410 --> 06:22.900
Does that mean it's not just meant to mess with me?

87
06:23.540 --> 06:26.710
I wonder if some of them are writing love letters, too.

88
06:27.000 --> 06:28.500
What if Takao's right?

89
06:28.580 --> 06:29.950
What if it's a love letter?

90
06:30.040 --> 06:31.620
Is that even possible?

91
06:33.500 --> 06:37.150
By any chance, would this happen
to be a love letter, or...?

92
06:40.390 --> 06:41.930
What's with the silence?!

93
06:42.500 --> 06:43.750
Why don't you just read it?

94
06:43.830 --> 06:46.130
Uh, I will, just gimme a minute.

95
06:46.450 --> 06:48.280
I gotta open it up first.

96
06:48.870 --> 06:50.160
Based on that reaction,

97
06:50.250 --> 06:53.330
I'd wager anything that this
is designed just to tease me.

98
06:53.410 --> 06:55.290
Whatever it ends up saying, I have to be firm

99
06:55.300 --> 06:57.330
and confident so that she doesn't get the chance.

100
06:57.410 --> 06:59.160
Be bold! Be brave!

101
07:00.250 --> 07:01.360
But what if...

102
07:01.830 --> 07:04.000
No, it can't be.

103
07:04.080 --> 07:05.660
Why would it be?

104
07:05.750 --> 07:07.530
There's no way!

105
07:07.870 --> 07:12.330
But if it is a love letter, then... I...

106
07:35.160 --> 07:37.370
You could have just asked me to my face.

107
07:37.450 --> 07:39.940
But everyone's writing letters now. It's cool.

108
07:40.660 --> 07:45.540
However, I was also curious how you'd react.

109
07:48.540 --> 07:51.140
So I was right! You were messing with me!

110
07:51.410 --> 07:53.000
Shut it, Nishikata!

111
08:17.540 --> 08:18.830
Thanks a lot.

112
08:18.910 --> 08:20.660
I appreciate it, young man.

113
08:20.750 --> 08:22.580
Welcome. I gotta go now.

114
08:24.000 --> 08:25.410
Oh, one second!

115
08:26.910 --> 08:28.580
What's your name, new kid?

116
08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
Did I forget to say?

117
08:31.580 --> 08:32.890
I'm Nishikata.

118
08:33.790 --> 08:36.330
Nishikata. Congrats on getting in!

119
08:38.120 --> 08:40.080
Mm-hmm.

120
08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
Thanks.

121
08:43.370 --> 08:47.000
You'll all be learning alongside each
other over the course of the next year.

122
08:47.080 --> 08:49.620
I'm not gonna force you to get along with everybody.

123
08:49.700 --> 08:53.040
But I hope you realize you're only gonna
make the experience worse if you don't.

124
08:53.870 --> 08:56.000
Oh, no, did I lose it somewhere?

125
08:56.660 --> 09:00.330
Well, I don't want to bore you right
off the bat with a long speech, so...

126
09:02.500 --> 09:04.330
Slept in on the first day?

127
09:04.410 --> 09:06.120
No, I was, uh...

128
09:06.200 --> 09:08.370
If nothing else, I admire your audacity.

129
09:08.450 --> 09:09.950
But... Sir, I--

130
09:10.040 --> 09:11.120
What's your name?

131
09:12.500 --> 09:13.970
It's Nishikata.

132
09:14.330 --> 09:16.620
All right, then. Sit down.

133
09:16.700 --> 09:18.130
Uh... Yes, sir.

134
09:25.450 --> 09:27.790
Oh, great, Everyone's staring.

135
09:27.870 --> 09:29.910
I have to make friends with people and clear things up

136
09:30.000 --> 09:32.750
before I become known as "that
guy who was late on day one."

137
09:35.330 --> 09:37.120
Mr. Tanabe, a moment of your time?

138
09:39.830 --> 09:42.250
They called and said they're running a little bit late.

139
09:42.330 --> 09:43.410
Really?

140
09:43.500 --> 09:44.950
Are we pushing the entrance ceremony back?

141
09:45.040 --> 09:46.700
Yes, I'll keep you posted.

142
09:47.450 --> 09:51.000
I just got word that the entrance
ceremony is running behind schedule.

143
09:51.080 --> 09:53.540
Sounds like it's gonna take a
while before they're all set up.

144
09:53.620 --> 09:56.120
So in the meantime...

145
09:56.200 --> 09:57.620
...we're figuring out seating.

146
10:03.750 --> 10:05.770
At least I'm not in the front. Sucks to be you.

147
10:05.800 --> 10:06.930
Oh, come on.

148
10:06.930 --> 10:10.370
I'm literally as far in the corner as I possibly can be.

149
10:11.540 --> 10:14.410
Normally I'd be happy about being
this far away from the teacher.

150
10:14.500 --> 10:16.250
It's the best spot to goof off.

151
10:16.330 --> 10:18.050
But I don't know anyone as it is!

152
10:18.580 --> 10:20.770
There's no one behind me or to my left.

153
10:21.330 --> 10:23.200
Worse, I'm sitting next to a girl.

154
10:25.580 --> 10:27.290
Did you actually sleep in?

155
10:27.950 --> 10:29.870
She's talking to me.

156
10:29.950 --> 10:32.790
It looked like you were about
to say something to the teacher.

157
10:32.870 --> 10:34.830
Uh... Yeah.

158
10:34.910 --> 10:37.000
No. I didn't actually sleep in.

159
10:38.580 --> 10:40.290
If only I'd made it here earlier.

160
10:41.000 --> 10:43.290
I was at the school on time, but...

161
10:43.370 --> 10:44.910
It's Takagi's fault.

162
10:45.000 --> 10:46.330
Whoever that is.

163
10:46.410 --> 10:47.330
Huh?

164
10:47.750 --> 10:49.850
All right everyone, head to the gym.

165
10:50.870 --> 10:52.080
Let's keep quiet.

166
10:52.160 --> 10:53.040
And no running

167
10:53.120 --> 10:54.750
Okay.

168
10:56.620 --> 10:57.580
Hey!

169
10:58.830 --> 11:00.370
You want to walk there together?

170
11:00.450 --> 11:01.500
Sure.

171
11:07.120 --> 11:08.330
Wait a second.

172
11:09.750 --> 11:13.290
You will soon be given a great gift, the right to vote.

173
11:13.370 --> 11:16.870
With it, you will choose students
for positions of responsibility.

174
11:16.950 --> 11:21.450
It's important you select politicians who
are worthy of your trust and confidence.

175
11:21.540 --> 11:25.660
Similarly, your mothers and fathers
choose their representatives by voting...

176
11:28.790 --> 11:31.200
Wasn't that speech crazy long?

177
11:31.290 --> 11:34.330
That dude was talking so long I almost fell asleep!

178
11:34.410 --> 11:37.370
I know, it was like when we started elementary school.

179
11:39.000 --> 11:41.580
You're pretty cool for coming' in late on the first day.

180
11:41.660 --> 11:42.950
I didn't mean to.

181
11:43.040 --> 11:45.330
Everybody quit yapping' and take your seats.

182
11:57.000 --> 11:58.870
I'm sorry for getting back late, sir.

183
11:58.950 --> 12:00.040
Just go sit down.

184
12:01.080 --> 12:05.090
That's it for today, but remember,
real classes start tomorrow.

185
12:05.500 --> 12:07.790
Don't mess around because I'm letting you out early.

186
12:07.870 --> 12:09.080
Go straight home.

187
12:09.870 --> 12:11.620
Hey, Nishikata.

188
12:13.160 --> 12:15.920
How 'bout I try to guess why you were late today?

189
12:16.410 --> 12:17.670
I bet I can.

190
12:18.700 --> 12:21.120
If I get it right on my first try, I win.

191
12:22.160 --> 12:23.540
Sure, I guess.

192
12:23.620 --> 12:26.450
Wait, how is she gonna figure it out on her first try?

193
12:29.440 --> 12:32.040
You were delivering a lost item.

194
12:32.120 --> 12:33.330
What? How'd you know?

195
12:33.410 --> 12:36.370
Hey. Quiet down, Nishikata.

196
12:36.450 --> 12:37.620
I'm sorry, sir.

197
12:39.660 --> 12:40.820
How did you know?

198
12:47.950 --> 12:49.450
How indeed.

199
12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
Uh... Wait.

200
12:55.290 --> 12:57.160
You're Takagi?

201
12:57.250 --> 13:00.120
You weren't here yet when
everyone introduced themselves.

202
13:09.950 --> 13:11.540
What's with that reaction?

203
13:11.620 --> 13:12.890
Hey! I just said to be quiet!

204
13:12.950 --> 13:13.860
Sorry!

205
13:21.790 --> 13:23.910
Thanks a lot. For picking it up.

206
13:27.540 --> 13:29.410
It's nice to meet you.

207
13:32.580 --> 13:34.330
It's nice to meet you, too.

208
13:38.870 --> 13:43.480
Seventy-two! Seventy-three!

209
13:43.870 --> 13:48.580
Seventy-four! Seventy-five!

210
13:56.160 --> 13:58.250
All this work's finally starting' to pay off!

211
14:09.120 --> 14:10.250
Oh, man.

212
14:40.160 --> 14:41.370
She's not here yet.

213
14:45.290 --> 14:46.790
Morning, Nishikata.

214
14:46.870 --> 14:48.830
Oh, good morning yourself, Takagi!

215
14:52.580 --> 14:55.230
So, hey. Have you heard?

216
14:55.790 --> 14:58.290
They're going to be changing where everyone sits today.

217
15:04.250 --> 15:05.700
Really? When?

218
15:05.790 --> 15:07.200
During homeroom.

219
15:07.290 --> 15:09.370
Homeroom? That's first period!

220
15:22.660 --> 15:24.120
--Taka-- --Are you okay?

221
15:29.750 --> 15:31.200
First period, huh?

222
15:31.290 --> 15:33.410
That'll be kinda fun.

223
15:33.500 --> 15:34.450
Yeah?

224
15:36.410 --> 15:39.580
Well, I mean, we haven't had a
seating change in a while, so...

225
15:47.200 --> 15:48.410
Yeah, sure.

226
15:48.500 --> 15:50.640
I guess there are always positives.

227
15:51.290 --> 15:52.870
But if I'm being honest.

228
15:52.950 --> 15:55.250
I wanted to be next to you for a while longer.

229
15:58.910 --> 16:00.820
She's just messing with me again.

230
16:01.120 --> 16:02.540
I almost fell for it.

231
16:19.370 --> 16:22.630
Does anyone still need a number? No?

232
16:22.910 --> 16:25.830
Then move your desks according
to the layout on the board.

233
16:25.910 --> 16:27.370
What number did you draw?

234
16:27.450 --> 16:28.660
Twenty-nine.

235
16:30.000 --> 16:32.450
Oh. The far back again, then.

236
16:33.120 --> 16:35.000
What about you?

237
16:35.080 --> 16:38.020
This time I'm front and center.

238
16:38.500 --> 16:39.450
Oh.

239
16:42.040 --> 16:43.600
We're going to be pretty far.

240
16:44.330 --> 16:45.290
Yeah.

241
16:46.040 --> 16:47.290
Later.

242
16:49.370 --> 16:52.500
All right! Now you can sneak
me answers on all our tests!

243
16:52.580 --> 16:53.910
What? That's cheating.

244
16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
I'm not doing that.

245
16:55.080 --> 16:56.330
It's called mutual aid.

246
16:56.410 --> 16:57.370
Oh, yeah?

247
16:57.450 --> 16:58.700
Well what do I get out of it?

248
16:58.790 --> 17:00.290
Words of encouragement from your friend!

249
17:00.370 --> 17:01.870
Yay...

250
17:01.950 --> 17:03.200
Yo, Nishikata.

251
17:03.290 --> 17:04.830
Are you sitting' here?

252
17:04.910 --> 17:06.080
Nah, over there.

253
17:06.160 --> 17:07.290
Oh, yeah?

254
17:07.370 --> 17:09.580
That's too bad. I was hoping we'd be closer.

255
17:09.660 --> 17:10.790
Yeah, me too.

256
17:13.790 --> 17:15.950
My vision's been getting really bad lately.

257
17:16.040 --> 17:17.700
I hope I can see what's on the board.

258
17:33.920 --> 17:36.120
Oh. So that's it.

259
17:36.200 --> 17:38.290
I'm next to Nishikata, huh?

260
17:38.830 --> 17:39.870
You okay, Mano?

261
17:39.950 --> 17:42.410
Yeah. I'm just great.

262
17:44.910 --> 17:47.100
What's up? Are you not happy?

263
17:47.580 --> 17:50.810
It's nothing. Feel free to just ignore me.

264
17:51.370 --> 17:54.330
I'm just depressed because I'm not sitting near Nakai.

265
17:54.410 --> 17:57.040
I was really hoping we'd be next to each other.

266
18:00.700 --> 18:03.040
How far away is he?

267
18:03.120 --> 18:04.830
Hey.

268
18:04.910 --> 18:06.790
Someone!

269
18:06.870 --> 18:09.580
Anyone! Please switch seats with me!

270
18:09.660 --> 18:14.160
How am I supposed to sneak an early lunch
if I'm right in front of the teacher?

271
18:14.250 --> 18:17.160
You aren't switching seats unless
you have a legitimate reason.

272
18:17.250 --> 18:18.580
Also, Kimura.

273
18:18.660 --> 18:20.700
Please, do see me after class.

274
18:23.080 --> 18:25.700
Right in front of the teacher?

275
18:25.790 --> 18:27.290
But if I'm being honest.

276
18:27.370 --> 18:29.620
I wanted to be next to you for a while longer.

277
18:47.370 --> 18:48.540
Hey, Kimura, listen!

278
18:48.620 --> 18:50.540
I can't see the board from here; let's switch!

279
18:50.620 --> 18:51.750
Oh. Thanks!

280
18:51.830 --> 18:53.540
But I already found someone.

281
19:02.830 --> 19:04.950
It's not like I care.

282
19:09.200 --> 19:11.790
Nishikata. Hey.

283
19:21.160 --> 19:22.410
What the--?

284
19:23.040 --> 19:25.040
Guess what? I'm sitting here now.

285
19:25.120 --> 19:26.580
Wha--? But how?

286
19:27.200 --> 19:29.370
Well, first Nakai and Kimura switched.

287
19:29.450 --> 19:31.680
Because Nakai couldn't see the board well enough.

288
19:31.950 --> 19:34.040
So Nakai was all the way up front.

289
19:34.120 --> 19:38.330
When she saw that, Mano wanted to switch with
me, since I was right next to him.

290
19:38.410 --> 19:41.870
Mano's short, so she prefers the front anyway.

291
19:41.950 --> 19:43.790
Oh. I see.

292
19:45.000 --> 19:46.660
Nishikata.

293
19:46.750 --> 19:49.160
You tried to sit next to me up there, didn't you?

294
19:51.290 --> 19:53.200
No, I...

295
19:53.290 --> 19:55.360
I couldn't see the board well from here.

296
19:56.290 --> 19:57.140
Hmm?

297
19:58.000 --> 19:59.040
Oh, yeah?

298
20:01.580 --> 20:02.540
Mmm?

299
20:04.540 --> 20:05.950
What? It's true!

300
20:06.040 --> 20:07.750
All right, we're starting class.

301
20:07.830 --> 20:09.040
Get your textbooks out.

302
20:09.120 --> 20:10.620
Oh. That reminds me.

303
20:10.700 --> 20:13.410
What was it that you wanted to say earlier today?

304
20:13.910 --> 20:15.200
What, did I read you wrong?

305
20:15.290 --> 20:17.160
I thought you were looking for an opportunity.

306
20:25.040 --> 20:26.000
Sorry.

307
20:26.080 --> 20:28.130
It took me a while to return this.

308
20:28.620 --> 20:29.650
Thank you.

309
20:30.700 --> 20:32.330
From over summer break?

310
20:32.410 --> 20:33.910
Uh... Yeah.

311
20:34.000 --> 20:35.660
From then, and...

312
20:35.750 --> 20:36.890
The first day of school?

313
20:37.160 --> 20:38.480
You remembered that?

314
20:38.830 --> 20:40.790
Of course I did. You did too.

315
20:45.500 --> 20:46.910
Heh! Thank you.

316
20:47.700 --> 20:49.540
I made sure to wash it for you.

317
20:54.450 --> 20:55.520
Oh, nothing.

318
20:56.500 --> 20:58.870
I'm just kinda glad.

319
20:58.950 --> 21:01.000
--Why? --Oh. Y'know...

320
21:01.080 --> 21:02.020
For a lot.

321
21:02.500 --> 21:04.540
That I got to return your handkerchief.

322
21:04.870 --> 21:07.450
And that we ended up next to each other again, oh!

323
21:07.450 --> 21:08.620
And also...

324
21:08.700 --> 21:10.000
Well, yeah.

325
21:11.290 --> 21:12.790
I'm looking forward to this.

326
21:12.870 --> 21:15.290
So here, we'd say, "I do not agree."

327
21:15.370 --> 21:18.460
Or you could contract it to, "I don't agree."

328
21:19.080 --> 21:20.160
That part's pretty easy.

329
21:20.160 --> 21:22.750
But on the next page,
things get a little more complicated.

03:43.010 --> 03:46.890
