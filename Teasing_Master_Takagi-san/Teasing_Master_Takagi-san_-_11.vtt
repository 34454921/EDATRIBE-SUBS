00:03.580 --> 00:05.580
How to approach a cat.

2
00:05.660 --> 00:08.870
Step one: Don't make eye contact.

3
00:08.950 --> 00:12.120
Step two: Assume a crouching posture.

4
00:14.830 --> 00:16.450
That do anything for ya?

5
00:16.540 --> 00:20.290
You can tell by my body language
that I'm not a threat, right?

6
00:20.370 --> 00:24.370
Step three: Approach ever so slowly.

7
00:28.200 --> 00:29.580
This is incredible!

8
00:29.660 --> 00:31.870
I guess that guy on TV wasn't kidding!

9
00:31.950 --> 00:33.700
His advice is just what I needed.

10
00:37.040 --> 00:38.290
Oh, hey! Nishikata!

11
00:44.750 --> 00:45.910
What were you doing?

12
00:48.530 --> 00:49.620
Nothing.

13
02:25.620 --> 02:28.370
Curse you, Takagi!

14
02:28.450 --> 02:31.910
I was this close to petting
that cat when you came along!

15
02:32.000 --> 02:33.200
But...

16
02:33.290 --> 02:36.120
On the other hand, I'm glad she
didn't actually see me petting it.

17
02:37.540 --> 02:39.500
Because if she did...

18
02:39.580 --> 02:41.540
Ooh, Nishikata's petting a cat!

19
02:41.620 --> 02:44.700
I thought boys weren't supposed to like cute things.

20
02:44.790 --> 02:46.620
She'd never let me live it down!

21
02:49.620 --> 02:52.250
And there's no way I'm gonna give
her more ammo to tease me with!

22
02:53.750 --> 02:54.700
Look, a cat.

23
02:54.790 --> 02:55.750
Really?

24
02:57.290 --> 02:58.870
Oh, wow. You like cats?

25
02:58.950 --> 03:00.620
Not especially.

26
03:00.700 --> 03:02.580
Crap! That was close.

27
03:04.370 --> 03:05.410
Here, kitty, kitty.

28
03:06.950 --> 03:08.500
Over here.

29
03:09.910 --> 03:11.870
So naive, Takagi.

30
03:11.950 --> 03:14.080
Cats are very wary creatures.

31
03:14.160 --> 03:16.370
There's no way one would just waltz right--

32
03:17.110 --> 03:18.050
Come here.

33
03:18.050 --> 03:19.620
--Wh-What?!

34
03:19.700 --> 03:22.450
Why? That wasn't even a proper call!

35
03:22.540 --> 03:23.620
Unless...

36
03:23.700 --> 03:26.040
What is she, some sort of cat whisperer?

37
03:26.120 --> 03:27.370
That's a good boy.

38
03:27.450 --> 03:29.370
You're looking cuter than usual, Meeta.

39
03:30.830 --> 03:32.040
Wait, you know this cat?

40
03:32.120 --> 03:35.830
Yep. He belongs to the old lady who
lives around the corner from us.

41
03:35.910 --> 03:38.660
No wonder! That explains it.

42
03:38.750 --> 03:40.620
Aww. So soft.

43
03:47.830 --> 03:50.200
He's great. And he really likes people.

44
03:50.290 --> 03:52.420
He'll let you pet him all you want.

45
03:53.080 --> 03:54.330
Could it really be?

46
03:54.410 --> 03:56.580
The coveted all-you-can-pet cat?

47
03:56.870 --> 03:58.450
I need him!

48
03:59.950 --> 04:01.620
Why don't you play with him a little?

49
04:01.700 --> 04:03.250
What? Why would I?

50
04:03.330 --> 04:04.050
Come on.

51
04:04.050 --> 04:06.080
You were trying to pet the other cat.

52
04:06.160 --> 04:08.540
You used that trick that was on TV yesterday.

53
04:08.620 --> 04:10.620
I think you wanna.

54
04:10.700 --> 04:12.410
She already knows!

55
04:12.500 --> 04:17.190
I just thought that guy on TV didn't
know what he was talking about, so...

56
04:17.580 --> 04:20.790
So... You don't particularly like cats or anything?

57
04:20.870 --> 04:22.500
No. Not really.

58
04:22.580 --> 04:25.540
And I've definitely never
wanted to pet a cat or anything.

59
04:25.620 --> 04:28.250
Really? That's surprising.

60
04:28.330 --> 04:30.200
They're just so cute.

61
04:30.290 --> 04:32.040
Their coats are all fluffy.

62
04:32.120 --> 04:34.120
And their paws are so squishy.

63
04:37.790 --> 04:39.330
Are you kidding me?

64
04:39.410 --> 04:41.620
This cat even lets people touch his paws?

65
04:41.700 --> 04:43.580
I wanna touch!

66
04:43.660 --> 04:44.620
But I can't!

67
04:44.700 --> 04:46.450
I've dug myself too deep for that!

68
04:47.580 --> 04:49.200
I know!

69
04:49.290 --> 04:53.200
I really don't get why people are always
going on and on about petting cats.

70
04:54.620 --> 04:56.700
It's not like they're really that cute.

71
04:56.790 --> 04:59.330
And even if they were, I wouldn't want to touch them.

72
04:59.410 --> 05:01.540
When it comes down to it, they're animals.

73
05:01.620 --> 05:03.450
You can never be sure what they'll do.

74
05:03.540 --> 05:05.540
You're taking a risk every time you approach one.

75
05:07.950 --> 05:09.250
I see what's going on.

76
05:09.330 --> 05:11.830
You're saying that because you're
afraid of getting scratched.

77
05:11.840 --> 05:13.250
She took the bait!

78
05:13.330 --> 05:15.120
Of course I'm not afraid!

79
05:15.200 --> 05:16.620
But... If you don't believe me,

80
05:16.700 --> 05:19.290
I'll just have to prove it
right now by petting this cat!

81
05:19.370 --> 05:20.290
That's okay.

82
05:20.370 --> 05:22.020
I actually believe you now.

83
05:22.450 --> 05:23.700
Sorry I doubted you.

84
05:31.250 --> 05:33.290
Your face is like an open book, Nishikata!

85
05:33.370 --> 05:35.390
You really want to pet this cat, huh?

86
05:36.580 --> 05:37.950
Takagi!

87
05:39.200 --> 05:40.290
What'll it be?

88
05:40.370 --> 05:41.830
You gonna pet him? Or leave him hanging?

89
05:45.370 --> 05:46.660
I want to pet him.

90
05:46.750 --> 05:48.870
Is that okay?

91
05:48.950 --> 05:50.250
Mm-hmm.

92
05:50.330 --> 05:52.080
Though I think Meeta has different plans.

93
05:52.160 --> 05:53.750
What do you mean?! He disappeared?!

94
05:53.830 --> 05:56.660
Yeah. Do you want to go look for a different cat to pet?

95
05:56.750 --> 05:58.250
We're gonna be late for school.

96
06:02.700 --> 06:06.040
So I asked, and Satou said
she likes Tanaka from Class 3.

97
06:06.120 --> 06:07.330
Oh, I called it.

98
06:07.410 --> 06:08.580
Didn't I call it?

99
06:12.370 --> 06:13.830
I can't take it anymore!

100
06:13.910 --> 06:15.540
I want to talk about love!

101
06:20.410 --> 06:22.410
So I've been doing some thinking.

102
06:22.500 --> 06:25.000
And I was wondering, what's like your type?

103
06:27.660 --> 06:29.750
Was that too abrupt?

104
06:29.830 --> 06:31.160
I never expected you to ask.

105
06:31.250 --> 06:32.830
I happen to like the dependent type.

106
06:34.250 --> 06:37.580
As for me, I prefer a well-built physique and long hair.

107
06:37.660 --> 06:38.620
Oh, yeah?

108
06:38.700 --> 06:40.040
I never would have guessed.

109
06:40.120 --> 06:41.410
It's happening!

110
06:41.500 --> 06:43.330
They're ready to talk about love too!

111
06:43.410 --> 06:44.750
It's funny.

112
06:44.830 --> 06:46.330
You just caught us in the middle of discussing that.

113
06:46.410 --> 06:48.580
Did I really? What a coincidence.

114
06:48.660 --> 06:50.200
They've both grown so much!

115
06:50.290 --> 06:52.290
All right. I'm gonna dig deeper here.

116
06:52.370 --> 06:55.000
What's your type, Yukari?

117
06:55.080 --> 06:56.450
I'm so glad you asked!

118
06:57.620 --> 07:01.660
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say long legs and handsome features are nice.

119
07:01.750 --> 07:03.080
What about hair?

120
07:03.160 --> 07:05.080
She's really particular about a guy's hair.

121
07:05.160 --> 07:07.790
I tend to like longer hair too, like you do.

122
07:07.870 --> 07:09.500
Ah! This is fun!

123
07:09.580 --> 07:12.580
I've wanted to have a conversation
like this with friends forever!

124
07:12.660 --> 07:14.160
So then a borzoi, yeah?

125
07:14.250 --> 07:16.370
Uh-huh. A borzo--Eh?

126
07:17.200 --> 07:19.250
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

127
07:19.330 --> 07:21.250
Dogs, duh. What are you talking about?

128
07:24.580 --> 07:26.250
Which breed is your favorite?

129
07:26.330 --> 07:28.160
I don't know, Chihuahuas?

130
07:28.250 --> 07:31.250
What? But they don't fit into your description at all!

131
07:31.330 --> 07:34.040
Well, there are some long-haired Chihuahuas out there.

132
07:44.450 --> 07:45.750
You gonna draw?

133
07:45.830 --> 07:46.620
Hm?

134
07:46.700 --> 07:49.080
You're going to run out of time.

135
07:49.160 --> 07:50.120
Yeah.

136
07:56.370 --> 07:58.000
Why does it have to be a portrait?

137
07:58.080 --> 07:59.750
Can't we just draw whatever we want?

138
08:08.250 --> 08:11.080
I'm your reference. You have to actually look at me.

139
08:11.160 --> 08:12.370
I am looking.

140
08:15.660 --> 08:16.830
Everyone?

141
08:16.910 --> 08:18.620
Remember to observe your subject.

142
08:18.700 --> 08:22.040
Don't get too focused on drawing or
this'll take longer than necessary.

143
08:22.120 --> 08:23.620
You need to strike a balance.

144
08:23.700 --> 08:27.690
Take twice as much time studying your
reference as you do drawing them.

145
08:28.330 --> 08:29.540
You heard her.

146
08:31.500 --> 08:32.500
Yeah, I did.

147
08:38.120 --> 08:39.290
Why are you laughing?

148
08:39.370 --> 08:41.500
Oh... Oh, sorry. It's nothing.

149
08:41.580 --> 08:42.870
Yeah, right.

150
08:42.950 --> 08:44.660
What was that all about?

151
08:44.750 --> 08:46.370
Is there something on my face?

152
08:46.450 --> 08:50.510
No, there wasn't anything there when I checked
in the bathroom mirror during the break.

153
08:51.410 --> 08:53.370
What, then? Bed head?

154
08:53.540 --> 08:55.620
No, I checked my hair, too.

155
08:56.540 --> 08:58.820
Is she just laughing at my face itself?

156
08:58.930 --> 09:01.150
I can't do anything about that!

157
09:01.330 --> 09:03.430
Calm down, calm down!

158
09:03.650 --> 09:04.660
I know.

159
09:04.750 --> 09:06.340
It's just her usual game.

160
09:06.660 --> 09:10.830
There's nothing wrong-- she's just making
me worry so she can enjoy my reaction.

161
09:11.790 --> 09:14.050
Well two can play at that game.

162
09:19.540 --> 09:21.330
Are you laughing at how bad your drawing is?

163
09:21.330 --> 09:22.410
I am not!

164
09:22.410 --> 09:25.420
Then is there something on my
face that's making you laugh?

165
09:25.450 --> 09:26.530
Ugh!

166
09:26.560 --> 09:28.950
I didn't expect her to just ask me flat out.

167
09:29.040 --> 09:30.410
No, there isn't.

168
09:30.500 --> 09:31.600
Hm?

169
09:32.070 --> 09:34.140
Oh, good, she backed down.

170
09:34.540 --> 09:36.770
Mina, I told you a hundred times!

171
09:37.080 --> 09:39.580
My eyes don't slant that much, you're exaggerating.

172
09:39.660 --> 09:42.160
But that's how I envision you, so that's how I drew it.

173
09:42.250 --> 09:44.330
Don't draw what you see in your mind, draw me!

174
09:44.410 --> 09:45.240
That's it!

175
09:45.580 --> 09:47.870
This is supposed to be me?

176
09:47.950 --> 09:49.870
Well, yeah, that's how I envision you.

177
09:49.950 --> 09:51.370
I can't help it.

178
09:51.450 --> 09:52.660
That'll teach her.

179
10:00.950 --> 10:03.750
Okay. Only ten minutes left.

180
10:03.830 --> 10:05.790
Oh, this is gonna be good.

181
10:06.410 --> 10:08.160
Hey, Nishikata.

182
10:08.370 --> 10:09.580
Mind if I take a look?

183
10:14.080 --> 10:15.330
Nope. Go ahead.

184
10:19.120 --> 10:21.290
How do you like that?

185
10:27.550 --> 10:28.700
Oh, no.

186
10:28.790 --> 10:30.880
Did I take it too far?

187
10:31.160 --> 10:34.410
I just drew that based on how I envision you, so...

188
10:35.750 --> 10:36.700
Nishikata.

189
10:45.200 --> 10:46.950
That face is too much, Takagi!

190
10:48.750 --> 10:50.580
My stomach hurts already!

191
10:50.660 --> 10:53.430
If you're gonna draw me weird,
you should draw that face.

192
10:53.830 --> 10:57.180
Try again. You can do it. Here.

193
10:57.500 --> 10:58.620
Okay.

194
11:06.910 --> 11:09.200
If you can't see me well, I can get closer.

195
11:09.290 --> 11:11.520
Uh, no, no, that's fine, you're good.

196
11:12.040 --> 11:13.080
'Kay.

197
11:18.500 --> 11:21.600
When I get a good look at her, Takagi is kinda...

198
11:22.200 --> 11:24.160
Pre-- Pret--

199
11:24.250 --> 11:25.080
Pretty--

200
11:25.160 --> 11:26.870
There. Finished. You see?

201
11:30.750 --> 11:31.700
So?

202
11:33.620 --> 11:36.410
Was I really looking sideways that much?

203
11:36.500 --> 11:38.000
Oh! Forgot something.

204
11:42.290 --> 11:43.370
Now it's done.

205
11:48.370 --> 11:50.410
Why'd you add red? It's not like I'm blushing!

206
11:50.500 --> 11:51.830
Uh, you have been this whole time.

207
11:51.910 --> 11:52.870
No, I haven't!

208
11:52.950 --> 11:55.200
It just looks like that. I swear!

209
11:55.290 --> 11:56.450
Look closely, I'm not!

210
12:03.830 --> 12:05.200
Oh, not bad.

211
12:05.290 --> 12:07.750
This card means your wish will more or less come true.

212
12:07.830 --> 12:09.290
Really? Is that so?

213
12:10.250 --> 12:13.160
You should totally get your love fortune told too, Mina.

214
12:13.250 --> 12:14.410
She's good at this.

215
12:14.500 --> 12:15.660
See? Go for it!

216
12:15.750 --> 12:18.140
Huh? You say you want me to get my fortune told,

217
12:18.160 --> 12:20.620
but I know you really just want to get yours done.

218
12:20.700 --> 12:22.080
What do you mean? You don't know that!

219
12:22.160 --> 12:23.250
It's obvious.

220
12:23.330 --> 12:25.160
No, I just wanted Mina to do it!

221
12:28.000 --> 12:29.370
This really sucks.

222
12:29.450 --> 12:31.230
I just wanted to go home today.

223
12:31.540 --> 12:32.500
Nishikata.

224
12:33.540 --> 12:34.660
What do you want?

225
12:34.750 --> 12:37.750
Rock-paper-scissors. You up for a match?

226
12:37.830 --> 12:39.160
What? Why now?

227
12:39.250 --> 12:41.700
The loser has to buy the winner juice on the way home.

228
12:41.790 --> 12:43.250
Sound good?

229
12:43.330 --> 12:45.270
Sorry, but I just found out I have to clean the

230
12:45.280 --> 12:47.160
classroom after school, so go home without me.

231
12:49.330 --> 12:51.330
No problem, I'll just wait here for you.

232
12:51.410 --> 12:53.200
But I don't want to make you sit around.

233
12:55.580 --> 12:56.870
Okay.

234
12:56.950 --> 12:58.620
How about if you win, I have to help you clean up?

235
13:00.200 --> 13:02.580
Why do you wanna play rock-paper-scissors so bad?

236
13:02.660 --> 13:04.160
I'm just in the mood for it.

237
13:04.410 --> 13:06.080
All right, I guess it's okay.

238
13:07.330 --> 13:08.580
Under one condition!

239
13:08.660 --> 13:09.700
Which is...?

240
13:09.790 --> 13:13.620
No psychological attacks like telling
me what you're about to choose, okay?

241
13:13.910 --> 13:15.520
Sure. Fine with me.

242
13:15.830 --> 13:17.220
That was close.

243
13:17.450 --> 13:19.830
I don't need a repeat of that day I lost to her

244
13:19.840 --> 13:22.040
four times in a row because of those tricks.

245
13:22.120 --> 13:23.250
Now let's do it.

246
13:23.330 --> 13:25.000
Rock! Paper! Scissors!

247
13:27.580 --> 13:30.540
I-I won?

248
13:30.620 --> 13:33.500
This is my first ever victory over Takagi!

249
13:33.580 --> 13:37.080
Yes! I finally did it! I bet she's super mad!

250
13:37.160 --> 13:38.660
Well... Guess I'm helping.

251
13:47.040 --> 13:48.910
She doesn't seem to mind.

252
13:50.830 --> 13:53.200
Whatever, I don't care. I still won!

253
13:53.290 --> 13:55.790
I gotta celebrate while I have the chance.

254
13:55.870 --> 13:57.120
Nishikata?

255
13:57.200 --> 13:58.610
What is it, Takagi?

256
13:58.950 --> 14:00.540
Do you believe in fortune telling?

257
14:00.620 --> 14:03.290
Uh, fortunes? Not really.

258
14:03.370 --> 14:04.540
Why do you ask?

259
14:04.620 --> 14:06.450
The girls and I had ours told today.

260
14:06.540 --> 14:07.700
Oh.

261
14:07.790 --> 14:09.080
Is that what that deck of cards was earlier?

262
14:09.160 --> 14:10.450
They're called tarot cards.

263
14:13.250 --> 14:16.680
Actually, today my tarot reading was about love.

264
14:17.040 --> 14:18.000
Oh.

265
14:19.330 --> 14:20.540
Love?

266
14:20.620 --> 14:22.160
Turned out good.

267
14:22.620 --> 14:24.830
It said I'll do well with my current crush.

268
14:24.910 --> 14:26.060
Your current crush?

269
14:26.370 --> 14:27.980
Good for you, then.

270
14:28.290 --> 14:29.270
What about you?

271
14:29.450 --> 14:30.540
Do you have a crush?

272
14:33.250 --> 14:35.230
Huh? What was that?

273
14:36.160 --> 14:38.330
I said, "Do you have a crush?"

274
14:38.410 --> 14:41.870
Nope! I don't! Definitely not!

275
14:41.950 --> 14:43.580
I see.

276
14:43.660 --> 14:45.890
Why did she ask me that just now?

277
14:46.540 --> 14:47.700
Could it be?

278
14:47.790 --> 14:50.620
Does Takagi... like me?

279
14:52.910 --> 14:54.290
What's wrong?

280
14:54.370 --> 14:56.080
It's nothing! Don't worry about it, everything's cool!

281
15:01.080 --> 15:02.790
Why do I feel so nervous?

282
15:04.450 --> 15:06.080
Unless... I...

283
15:07.620 --> 15:10.450
Do I like Takagi?

284
15:12.370 --> 15:14.700
No, that's just ridiculous.

285
15:18.540 --> 15:20.290
Oh, by the way, Nishikata.

286
15:20.370 --> 15:21.460
Yeah? What's up?

287
15:22.040 --> 15:24.090
The reason I asked if you had a crush

288
15:24.750 --> 15:27.630
was because I had your tarot reading done, too.

289
15:28.700 --> 15:30.620
So that's why you asked me that.

290
15:30.700 --> 15:31.790
Makes sense I guess.

291
15:33.830 --> 15:35.000
Should have known.

292
15:37.830 --> 15:40.470
Wait. Am I disappointed?

293
15:40.910 --> 15:42.370
Yeah. And guess what?

294
15:42.450 --> 15:44.160
You'll do well with your crush, too.

295
15:47.000 --> 15:49.330
That'd be great. If you had a crush.

296
15:51.580 --> 15:52.950
You're blushing.

297
15:53.040 --> 15:55.000
That's because I'm hard at work cleaning.

298
15:55.080 --> 15:56.500
Just change the subject.

299
15:56.580 --> 15:58.790
So what other readings did you have done?

300
16:01.250 --> 16:03.790
I asked what you'd pick if we
played rock-paper-scissors.

301
16:03.870 --> 16:06.830
Huh? As in the match I won earlier?

302
16:06.910 --> 16:07.680
Mm-hmm.

303
16:07.780 --> 16:09.900
Clearly that didn't work out.

304
16:10.040 --> 16:11.950
It's just a fortune, not destiny.

305
16:12.040 --> 16:13.720
I feel stupid for worrying.

306
16:13.910 --> 16:16.570
Maybe if you didn't believe in
something as silly as fortune

307
16:16.580 --> 16:19.040
telling, you wouldn't be stuck here, doing half my work!

308
16:19.120 --> 16:20.950
It came true, though.

309
16:21.040 --> 16:23.500
Huh? What do you mean? I won that match, didn't I?

310
16:23.580 --> 16:25.410
Yup. You sure did.

311
16:31.200 --> 16:32.290
Come on.

312
16:32.370 --> 16:33.790
Let's get back to cleaning this place up.

313
16:33.870 --> 16:34.910
Yeah.

314
16:35.000 --> 16:36.250
Wait, what?

315
16:42.370 --> 16:43.370
"Critical."

316
16:46.910 --> 16:48.410
Today's the day.

317
16:48.500 --> 16:50.080
I'm gonna beat Takagi.

318
16:50.160 --> 16:51.160
Count on it!

319
16:52.250 --> 16:55.280
Oh. Hey, Nishikata. Good morning.

320
16:55.660 --> 16:57.730
Back atcha. Morning.

321
16:58.410 --> 17:00.660
Somebody's in a good mood today.

322
17:00.750 --> 17:02.540
Really? You think so?

323
17:04.000 --> 17:05.410
I'm in a great mood.

324
17:08.580 --> 17:11.000
You have no idea what's coming your way.

325
17:11.080 --> 17:14.000
It just so happens that I'm invincible today.

326
17:14.080 --> 17:16.340
Because according to my horoscope this morning,

327
17:16.580 --> 17:17.950
I am number--!

328
17:17.990 --> 17:20.910
Is it your horoscope? Cancer was number one today.

329
17:21.000 --> 17:22.250
Huh?!

330
17:22.330 --> 17:24.410
Hold on a second, how do you know I'm a cancer?

331
17:24.500 --> 17:27.790
I mean, I said happy birthday to you this year, so...

332
17:27.870 --> 17:31.160
Oh. I forgot. I guess that makes sense.

333
17:31.250 --> 17:33.910
What, does she read everyone's horoscope every day?

334
17:34.450 --> 17:35.460
She's crafty.

335
17:36.000 --> 17:37.910
But she underestimates me.

336
17:38.000 --> 17:41.040
I bet she doesn't know that in today's
blood-type fortune, I'm also--!

337
17:41.120 --> 17:43.660
Also, blood type O's number one, too.

338
17:43.750 --> 17:44.910
Huh?!

339
17:45.000 --> 17:46.870
Okay, how do you know that I'm blood type O?

340
17:46.950 --> 17:48.580
I had a feeling that you were.

341
17:48.660 --> 17:49.750
Just a guess.

342
17:52.200 --> 17:53.330
She's just too good.

343
17:53.410 --> 17:55.620
I was the one underestimating her.

344
17:56.000 --> 17:57.780
You just can't mess with this girl.

345
17:58.330 --> 18:00.080
But just you wait.

346
18:00.160 --> 18:01.700
Today I'm invinc--!

347
18:01.790 --> 18:03.790
Feeling invincible today, aren't you?

348
18:03.870 --> 18:06.290
Because of what you heard about both of your fortunes?

349
18:09.040 --> 18:10.540
Ah.

350
18:10.620 --> 18:12.950
Are you freaking' kidding me?

351
18:13.040 --> 18:15.250
Well then. I hope something good happens.

352
18:15.330 --> 18:16.700
Yeah, that'd be cool.

353
18:18.200 --> 18:20.330
I don't care if you basically read my mind!

354
18:20.410 --> 18:23.200
I'm lucky as can be today! I'll get you!

355
18:32.040 --> 18:33.790
Teased fifty times.

356
18:33.870 --> 18:36.620
Which means I have to do a hundred and fifty push-ups.

357
18:36.700 --> 18:38.910
Why? This sucks!

358
18:39.000 --> 18:42.660
Was it stupid of me to get excited just
because I'm supposed to have good fortune?

359
18:42.750 --> 18:44.200
Ugh...

360
18:44.290 --> 18:45.540
What's wrong?

361
18:45.620 --> 18:47.200
Are you upset because nothing special happened?

362
18:47.290 --> 18:48.910
It's just a silly fortune.

363
18:49.000 --> 18:51.880
You seemed to believe that tarot
reading you had the other day!

364
18:52.750 --> 18:56.480
Man, I've spent all day trying to
think of a plan to beat Takagi,

365
18:56.480 --> 18:58.830
but I couldn't come up with anything worthwhile.

366
18:58.910 --> 19:01.040
Maybe I should just call it quits for now.

367
19:01.120 --> 19:05.900
Either my fortune's wrong, or my luck is
that I only got teased fifty times today.

368
19:06.160 --> 19:07.330
Hey, Nishikata.

369
19:07.410 --> 19:09.370
Let's walk home together.

370
19:09.450 --> 19:11.060
Oh. Yeah, sure, why not?

371
19:11.540 --> 19:14.040
No, I can't let it end like this!

372
19:16.200 --> 19:19.410
By the way, what exactly did
your fortune say this morning?

373
19:19.500 --> 19:21.000
Say what? You mean...

374
19:21.080 --> 19:23.160
That short description they write with your rank?

375
19:23.250 --> 19:23.950
Mm-hmm.

376
19:24.040 --> 19:25.160
Uh, let's see.

377
19:25.250 --> 19:26.490
Something like...

378
19:26.710 --> 19:28.330
Cancer is in first place.

379
19:28.410 --> 19:30.500
You'll land a critical hit! Get 'em!

380
19:31.870 --> 19:34.000
That's right! A critical hit!

381
19:34.080 --> 19:36.870
Which means I can turn the tables with a single blow!

382
19:36.950 --> 19:38.450
It all makes sense now!

383
19:38.540 --> 19:42.830
No matter how many times she teases me today,
if I can get back at her just once, I win!

384
19:42.910 --> 19:44.480
Never give up hope!

385
19:44.750 --> 19:46.950
So? "Something like" what?

386
19:47.040 --> 19:50.100
Uh... I can't seem to remember what it was.

387
19:50.540 --> 19:51.910
Hey, Nishikata!

388
19:53.750 --> 19:56.100
That game Fierce Soccer's on sale today!

389
19:56.370 --> 19:58.040
We're playing' at his house. You in?

390
20:09.540 --> 20:10.880
Fierce Soccer, huh?

391
20:11.950 --> 20:13.780
I did want to play that.

392
20:15.200 --> 20:19.050
But I can't go home without scoring my critical hit!

393
20:19.660 --> 20:23.260
Then again, I haven't exactly
come up with any sort of plan yet.

394
20:23.870 --> 20:25.750
No, I should still be able to do it.

395
20:25.830 --> 20:27.450
I'm the luckiest man on earth today!

396
20:27.540 --> 20:29.120
I can do anything!

397
20:29.200 --> 20:31.000
You regret it?

398
20:31.080 --> 20:32.330
Turning 'em down?

399
20:32.410 --> 20:33.950
Oh, that. Nah.

400
20:35.500 --> 20:37.750
I wanted to walk home with you, anyway.

401
20:40.000 --> 20:42.580
Hmm. There's gotta be something.

402
20:44.830 --> 20:46.120
Hold on!

403
20:46.200 --> 20:48.080
I didn't just say something super awkward, did I?

404
20:55.700 --> 20:59.580
Uh... I remembered my fortune which said
I'd land a critical hit today, so...

405
20:59.660 --> 21:02.620
I thought today was gonna be my best
chance to beat you at something!

406
21:02.700 --> 21:04.750
So what I just said wasn't what it sounded like!

407
21:08.700 --> 21:10.450
This is the worst!

408
21:10.540 --> 21:12.410
I didn't land a critical hit!

409
21:12.500 --> 21:14.330
I scored on my own goal!

410
21:17.000 --> 21:18.750
So uh... Do me a solid.

411
21:18.830 --> 21:20.450
Could'ya pretend you didn't hear that?

412
21:22.830 --> 21:24.410
I guess I can do that.

413
21:25.700 --> 21:27.320
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

414
21:27.830 --> 21:30.160
If you say it one more time.

415
21:31.290 --> 21:33.220
