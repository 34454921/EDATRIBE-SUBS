00:07.500 --> 00:11.000
There's gotta be some way I can
beat Takagi at her own game.

2
00:11.080 --> 00:13.480
I gotta get that last laugh!

3
00:15.040 --> 00:20.230
Or, at the very least, I have to do something
to stop her from teasing me every day.

4
00:21.080 --> 00:23.170
Sorry, I didn't see you--!

5
00:27.540 --> 00:29.370
Hey, Nishikata.

6
00:29.600 --> 00:31.550
Good morning.

7
00:31.870 --> 00:34.050
Oh. Ah. Good morning.

8
00:34.450 --> 00:36.190
Uh. Something wrong?

9
00:36.190 --> 00:36.950
Oh, no.

10
00:37.330 --> 00:38.540
Not at all.

11
00:38.620 --> 00:39.520
Hmm...

12
00:39.870 --> 00:41.750
Well, you want to go to school together?

13
00:41.830 --> 00:42.740
Uh...

14
00:43.580 --> 00:44.560
Sure.

15
02:23.000 --> 02:24.410
Did she see that?

16
02:24.500 --> 02:27.950
Did she see me apologize to a pole?

17
02:28.040 --> 02:28.910
Hey, Nishikata.

18
02:29.000 --> 02:31.250
Yeah? What's up?

19
02:31.330 --> 02:33.000
Want to tandem ride?

20
02:33.080 --> 02:35.200
You already know my answer.

21
02:35.290 --> 02:37.660
We'll get in trouble if we're seen.

22
02:37.750 --> 02:39.250
You're just too embarrassed.

23
02:39.330 --> 02:40.620
No, I am not!

24
02:40.700 --> 02:42.580
Yeah. Right.

25
02:43.290 --> 02:45.700
Well, she hasn't said anything strange.

26
02:45.790 --> 02:47.820
Guess she must have just missed seeing me.

27
02:48.250 --> 02:49.320
Phew.

28
02:51.370 --> 02:52.450
Took you long enough.

29
02:52.540 --> 02:54.250
Breaking out the winter uniform?

30
02:54.330 --> 02:58.660
Yeah. It's been getting colder lately,
so I thought the time was just about right.

31
03:00.450 --> 03:02.330
Wh-What?

32
03:02.410 --> 03:03.870
Did you grow?

33
03:03.950 --> 03:04.580
Huh?

34
03:05.580 --> 03:08.590
I think that uniform looked a
little bigger on you last spring.

35
03:09.580 --> 03:12.620
Now that I think about it, she might be right.

36
03:12.700 --> 03:15.160
This thing feels like it was tailor-made for me.

37
03:15.250 --> 03:16.500
I didn't even notice.

38
03:16.870 --> 03:18.050
Could it be?

39
03:18.540 --> 03:20.880
Am I finally having a growth spurt?

40
03:23.540 --> 03:24.330
Man.

41
03:24.330 --> 03:27.750
I'm growing so much lately,
I might need a new uniform soon.

42
03:27.830 --> 03:30.030
Must be one of those "growth spurts."

43
03:30.310 --> 03:33.890
But by comparison, you sure haven't
changed much, have you, Takagi?

44
03:38.580 --> 03:41.250
That's sexual harassment.

45
03:42.450 --> 03:44.290
"Haven't changed much."

46
03:46.310 --> 03:47.620
N-No!

47
03:47.700 --> 03:48.430
That's--

48
03:48.450 --> 03:50.990
Come on, you know that's not what I was talking about.

49
03:51.410 --> 03:54.580
Uh. I was talking about your height.

50
03:54.660 --> 03:57.250
Huh? Well, yeah, I was too.

51
03:57.330 --> 03:59.840
Why, what did you think I meant?

52
04:02.580 --> 04:04.750
N-Nothing.

53
04:04.830 --> 04:06.750
Oh?

54
04:06.830 --> 04:08.880
Now what?

55
04:09.500 --> 04:12.200
Hmm...

56
04:12.290 --> 04:13.540
You know what?

57
04:13.620 --> 04:15.370
I take it back, maybe you haven't gotten taller.

58
04:15.450 --> 04:16.660
Huh?!

59
04:16.750 --> 04:17.620
What do you mean?

60
04:17.700 --> 04:19.200
I totally grew!

61
04:19.290 --> 04:22.490
In fact, I'd be willing to bet
I'm taller than you now, Takagi!

62
04:24.080 --> 04:27.450
Yeah? Do you care to find out for sure?

63
04:33.410 --> 04:35.290
Why're we doing it here?

64
04:35.370 --> 04:37.440
So we can take our shoes off to be fair.

65
04:39.830 --> 04:41.540
We're gonna be late for school.

66
04:41.620 --> 04:42.540
Nah, this'll be quick.

67
04:42.620 --> 04:44.080
Here, turn around.

68
04:53.300 --> 04:54.800
Let's see.

69
04:55.620 --> 04:58.880
She's kinda... warm.

70
04:59.660 --> 05:01.500
Uhh...

71
05:01.580 --> 05:04.040
So, Takagi?

72
05:04.120 --> 05:05.200
Huh?

73
05:05.290 --> 05:09.870
Normally, wouldn't you stand against a
wall and make a mark to measure height?

74
05:09.940 --> 05:13.500
Yeah, but I think it's more accurate
if we stand together like this.

75
05:18.370 --> 05:20.080
I think we're about the same height.

76
05:20.160 --> 05:21.540
Huh? Really?

77
05:22.260 --> 05:23.290
Really.

78
05:23.370 --> 05:25.410
If you don't believe me, check for yourself.

79
05:31.580 --> 05:33.000
No way, you're right.

80
05:33.080 --> 05:34.040
Told yah.

81
05:34.750 --> 05:35.790
Hey.

82
05:35.870 --> 05:38.140
You're not like, on your tiptoes are you?

83
05:38.540 --> 05:40.580
Why? You don't trust me?

84
05:41.370 --> 05:42.550
All right then.

85
05:47.580 --> 05:48.790
Is this better?

86
05:48.870 --> 05:51.120
You'll be able to tell if I'm cheating now.

87
05:51.200 --> 05:54.450
Uh. Yeah. I guess.

88
06:04.370 --> 06:05.160
Wait.

89
06:05.250 --> 06:06.620
Now it kinda looks like.

90
06:06.700 --> 06:07.830
I'm taller.

91
06:07.910 --> 06:10.370
That's because I was on my tiptoes before.

92
06:10.450 --> 06:12.870
So you were cheating, I called it!

93
06:12.950 --> 06:13.700
You're a liar!

94
06:14.870 --> 06:16.910
I never said I wasn't on my tiptoes.

95
06:17.000 --> 06:18.200
Good for you though.

96
06:18.290 --> 06:20.040
You're taller after all.

97
06:21.370 --> 06:23.410
Yeah, walk away.

98
06:23.500 --> 06:27.440
You're acting all cool on the outside,
but on the inside, I bet you're really bitter!

99
06:28.870 --> 06:30.290
Oh. By the way,

100
06:30.370 --> 06:32.240
if you think I'm bitter, you're wrong.

101
06:33.290 --> 06:34.700
Know why?

102
06:34.790 --> 06:36.330
When your body grows too fast.

103
06:36.410 --> 06:37.660
You might run into things.

104
06:37.750 --> 06:39.700
Like, utility poles.

105
06:46.490 --> 06:47.460
Huh?

106
06:48.120 --> 06:50.290
Wait! Does that mean you saw me do that?

107
06:50.370 --> 06:51.040
Are you ready?

108
06:51.120 --> 06:52.080
School's a-waiting'!

109
06:52.160 --> 06:53.640
Takagi.

110
06:53.950 --> 06:55.240
Hey.

111
06:55.790 --> 06:57.410
Takagi?

112
07:08.080 --> 07:09.940
So cold.

113
07:11.620 --> 07:13.200
I dunno, I feel fine.

114
07:13.290 --> 07:16.040
You're so sensitive to the cold, Yukari.

115
07:16.450 --> 07:17.490
Take that!

116
07:17.870 --> 07:20.290
Mina, your hand is freezing!

117
07:29.450 --> 07:30.800
Jeez.

118
07:31.500 --> 07:34.450
You do that again, and I'll hate you forever.

119
07:35.410 --> 07:36.160
Forever?

120
07:38.540 --> 07:39.910
Will you stop it?

121
07:40.160 --> 07:41.000
Why?

122
07:41.080 --> 07:42.410
Because I hate it!

123
07:42.500 --> 07:44.540
Why are your hands so cold anyway?

124
07:44.620 --> 07:46.930
You know why.

125
07:47.330 --> 07:49.330
You just don't want to accept it.

126
07:49.580 --> 07:52.790
People who have cold hands have warm hearts!

127
07:52.870 --> 07:56.910
I don't think a person with a warm heart
would enjoy torturing their friends for kicks.

128
07:56.910 --> 07:58.040
Now, now.

129
07:58.120 --> 07:59.980
There's no need to hold a grudge.

130
08:02.000 --> 08:04.870
I'm not kidding. If you do it
again, I'm gonna be really mad.

131
08:04.870 --> 08:06.290
You're already mad.

132
08:06.700 --> 08:07.290
Gotcha.

133
08:07.900 --> 08:09.300
So cold!

134
08:09.790 --> 08:11.180
Stop it!

135
08:11.620 --> 08:12.950
I said stop, Sanae!

136
08:13.040 --> 08:15.660
That's the "My heart is so warm" attack.

137
08:15.750 --> 08:17.700
Help me, Yukari!

138
08:19.410 --> 08:20.870
Take this!

139
08:20.950 --> 08:23.580
Now let's see how you like it!

140
08:27.370 --> 08:30.160
Your hands are so warm. It's scary.

141
08:30.250 --> 08:33.450
That must mean you've got a cold heart.

142
08:33.540 --> 08:35.660
That is not what it means and you know it!

143
08:35.750 --> 08:37.620
Stay away, cold-heart!

144
08:37.700 --> 08:40.080
Prepare for the "Cold heart frozen soul" attack!

145
08:40.160 --> 08:40.950
Equally as fearsome!

146
08:41.040 --> 08:42.790
It's not even close!

147
08:44.000 --> 08:44.660
Hey.

148
08:44.750 --> 08:46.200
So cold!

149
08:46.290 --> 08:48.250
What'd you do that for?

150
08:51.290 --> 08:53.410
Get me back if you can.

151
08:54.910 --> 08:56.660
You get back here!

152
08:56.750 --> 08:58.750
Stop that!

153
08:58.830 --> 09:01.500
Quadruple cold hands!

154
09:02.290 --> 09:03.750
Four times the power!

155
09:03.830 --> 09:05.700
No way can I do that.

156
09:10.700 --> 09:11.560
Will you stop it?!

157
09:11.560 --> 09:12.910
Your hands are cold as ice!

158
09:12.910 --> 09:14.200
Leave me alone!

159
09:14.910 --> 09:18.670
Did you know they say that people
with cold hands have warm hearts?

160
09:18.830 --> 09:19.680
Nope!

161
09:23.120 --> 09:25.410
It's Takagi and Nishikata, again.

162
09:25.500 --> 09:28.040
I saw them show up to school together today.

163
09:28.120 --> 09:30.620
Those two are so close.

164
09:30.700 --> 09:33.080
Well, maybe they are going out.

165
09:40.330 --> 09:42.500
I really can't help but wonder.

166
09:42.580 --> 09:44.260
Do you think they're going out?

167
09:44.950 --> 09:45.910
Who knows?

168
09:46.000 --> 09:47.750
You don't sound very interested.

169
09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
They're so close, it makes me want to know.

170
09:50.120 --> 09:50.950
Why is that?

171
09:51.040 --> 09:52.540
Are you jealous of them?

172
09:53.450 --> 09:54.830
Am I jealous?

173
09:54.910 --> 09:57.080
Well, not exactly, but...

174
09:57.660 --> 09:59.080
Mina.

175
09:59.160 --> 10:01.790
Yukari says she wishes she had
a boy she could flirt with.

176
10:01.870 --> 10:03.790
That's not even close to what I said!

177
10:03.870 --> 10:05.000
Hey.

178
10:05.080 --> 10:06.340
You listening?

179
10:07.450 --> 10:08.330
Mina?

180
10:08.410 --> 10:11.950
Sanae! I'm on the toilet.
Don't talk to me right now, please!

181
10:11.950 --> 10:14.790
You're gonna make me lose my concentration!

182
10:14.870 --> 10:15.830
Huh?

183
10:15.910 --> 10:18.470
You are too much sometimes, Sanae.

184
10:18.800 --> 10:19.700
It's good.

185
10:19.790 --> 10:21.120
You should watch it later.

186
10:21.200 --> 10:22.750
Really? Cool, I will!

187
10:22.830 --> 10:23.700
Hey, Takagi?

188
10:23.790 --> 10:25.830
Hmm?

189
10:28.120 --> 10:32.540
I just came up with the perfect plan!

190
10:32.620 --> 10:37.840
It's the ultimate, fail-proof plot to
tease Takagi on our way home from school!

191
10:40.120 --> 10:41.700
Hmm?

192
10:41.790 --> 10:44.830
What are you smirking to yourself about over there?

193
10:44.910 --> 10:47.080
Something pervy?

194
10:47.160 --> 10:47.600
No.

195
10:47.600 --> 10:49.810
It's nothing dirty or weird or whatever.

196
10:50.200 --> 10:51.330
Dirty or weird?

197
10:51.410 --> 10:52.290
That's what I said!

198
10:53.200 --> 10:54.910
Your face is turning red.

199
10:56.790 --> 10:57.610
Whatever.

200
10:57.610 --> 10:59.370
Just you wait until after school!

201
10:59.450 --> 11:01.180
By the way, Nishikata.

202
11:01.950 --> 11:03.780
Later, do you wanna walk home together?

203
11:03.780 --> 11:05.160
Yeah, sure!

204
11:09.500 --> 11:10.290
Oh, no!

205
11:10.370 --> 11:11.580
Was I too eager?

206
11:11.660 --> 11:13.450
Did she realize I'm up to something?

207
11:15.910 --> 11:16.950
I mean.

208
11:17.040 --> 11:18.160
Yeah, sure.

209
11:18.250 --> 11:19.910
Isn't that what you just said?

210
11:20.000 --> 11:21.290
Uh-huh.

211
11:21.370 --> 11:23.160
That a problem?

212
11:23.250 --> 11:24.620
Hmm...

213
11:24.700 --> 11:26.160
No.

214
11:26.250 --> 11:28.700
But just in case you change
your mind before school's out,

215
11:28.790 --> 11:31.450
you can give me a definite answer later.

216
11:32.290 --> 11:33.460
See ya.

217
11:38.450 --> 11:40.870
Well that was weird.

218
11:40.950 --> 11:43.520
As long as she isn't on to me, I guess it's fine.

219
11:44.000 --> 11:45.560
Hey, Nishikata!

220
11:46.160 --> 11:48.700
We were gonna play "Super-Pro" at my house today.

221
11:48.790 --> 11:50.200
You want in on that?

222
11:50.290 --> 11:51.280
Um...

223
11:52.200 --> 11:54.120
Sorry. I can't today.

224
11:54.200 --> 11:56.790
You spending time with your girlfriend again?

225
11:56.870 --> 11:58.000
My "girlfriend"?

226
11:58.080 --> 11:59.000
Takagi, right?

227
11:59.080 --> 12:00.080
I called it.

228
12:00.160 --> 12:02.410
Huh?! What are you talking about?

229
12:02.500 --> 12:03.910
We're not like that at all!

230
12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
It's true, Takagi and Nishikata are not going out.

231
12:08.080 --> 12:10.660
I know 'cuz we just asked her in the bathroom

232
12:10.750 --> 12:11.540
Aw, really?

233
12:11.620 --> 12:12.540
Yeah!

234
12:12.620 --> 12:15.250
Oh man, I seriously gotta go.

235
12:15.330 --> 12:17.220
Bathroom, here I come.

236
12:17.760 --> 12:22.120
Uhh... What was she doing in the
bathroom before if she has to go now?

237
12:25.080 --> 12:28.160
All right, putting that aside,
if you're not going out with her,

238
12:28.160 --> 12:30.950
why are you walking home with
her for like the hundredth time?

239
12:30.950 --> 12:33.250
Well, because she asked me to?

240
12:33.330 --> 12:34.280
Asked you?

241
12:34.320 --> 12:36.470
And you're sure that's not because you're going out?

242
12:36.470 --> 12:37.340
Uh.

243
12:38.040 --> 12:40.590
I don't think so, at least.

244
12:41.160 --> 12:42.440
Hmm?

245
12:43.290 --> 12:44.820
Okay, whatever.

246
12:45.410 --> 12:47.370
Hey, isn't next period in the lab?

247
12:47.450 --> 12:49.370
You're right, let's hurry!

248
12:57.000 --> 12:57.910
No way.

249
12:58.000 --> 12:59.540
I don't buy it.

250
12:59.620 --> 13:01.570
Takagi just wants to tease me.

251
13:04.950 --> 13:06.200
Ready to get going?

252
13:06.290 --> 13:09.200
Yeah. But we're going straight home today, okay?

253
13:09.290 --> 13:10.200
Huh?!

254
13:10.290 --> 13:11.950
But I had it all planned out!

255
13:12.040 --> 13:14.160
I wanted to get a Ponkan Popsicle!

256
13:14.250 --> 13:16.290
Don't you think it's a little bit cold for that?

257
13:16.370 --> 13:18.830
Not when you go inside and pump the heat it's not!

258
13:18.860 --> 13:20.340
You said it.

259
13:21.890 --> 13:24.160
If she's not gonna say anything about it,

260
13:24.250 --> 13:25.870
then to give her my "definite" answer,

261
13:25.950 --> 13:27.830
I've gotta ask her myself.

262
13:29.290 --> 13:32.450
That's kinda embarrassing now
that I'm face to face with it.

263
13:32.450 --> 13:35.490
I've never been the one to ask
her to walk home with me before.

264
13:36.330 --> 13:37.490
Nishikata.

265
13:37.910 --> 13:39.580
Yeah? What's going' on?

266
13:39.660 --> 13:40.530
Oh, good!

267
13:40.530 --> 13:42.660
If she asks me, all I have to do is say yes!

268
13:42.750 --> 13:43.810
That's easy!

269
13:44.870 --> 13:45.870
You know what?

270
13:45.870 --> 13:49.210
Earlier today someone asked me
if I was going out with you.

271
13:49.620 --> 13:50.830
Huh?!

272
13:50.910 --> 13:51.830
And...

273
13:51.910 --> 13:53.410
After I told them we weren't,

274
13:53.500 --> 13:55.820
they said that they thought I liked you.

275
13:56.250 --> 13:58.750
I'm always asking you to walk home with me.

276
13:58.830 --> 14:01.130
Maybe that's why they thought that.

277
14:02.370 --> 14:03.700
I should have known!

278
14:03.790 --> 14:05.750
This is what you were after the whole time!

279
14:05.830 --> 14:07.410
Hmm?

280
14:08.290 --> 14:12.540
You orchestrated everything, so I have no
choice but to ask you to walk home with me!

281
14:12.540 --> 14:14.480
Just so you can watch me squirm!

282
14:15.160 --> 14:16.370
You okay?

283
14:16.450 --> 14:17.950
Try to sound calm.

284
14:18.040 --> 14:21.020
Just say something like, "Oh yeah? That's funny."

285
14:21.540 --> 14:25.240
Oh yeah? Tha-That's funny!

286
14:25.830 --> 14:27.040
Nice!

287
14:27.580 --> 14:28.200
Uh.

288
14:28.290 --> 14:29.330
So, anyway.

289
14:29.410 --> 14:31.530
About your request from this morning.

290
14:31.950 --> 14:33.160
Hmm?

291
14:33.250 --> 14:34.120
Uh.

292
14:34.200 --> 14:36.370
I don't have any plans, so uh...

293
14:37.790 --> 14:38.960
Let's...

294
14:42.040 --> 14:43.500
"Let's" what?

295
14:43.580 --> 14:45.160
Hang in there, man!

296
14:45.250 --> 14:47.200
If you can get through this,

297
14:47.290 --> 14:50.280
then you get your chance to mess with Takagi!

298
14:53.870 --> 14:56.030
Let's walk home together.

299
15:02.870 --> 15:04.450
I'll have to think about it.

300
15:04.750 --> 15:06.080
Huh?!

301
15:07.290 --> 15:08.540
I'm just kidding.

302
15:08.620 --> 15:10.040
Let's go.

303
15:11.950 --> 15:13.580
I can't wait.

304
15:15.450 --> 15:18.700
Because... it looks like you're scheming something.

305
15:18.790 --> 15:20.930
She's on to me!

306
15:27.830 --> 15:31.450
If she's already suspicious of
me, should I hold off on my plan?

307
15:31.450 --> 15:33.870
But I came up with such a good idea!

308
15:33.950 --> 15:37.760
Not that I've thought about how to carry
out said idea to begin with, though.

309
15:43.540 --> 15:44.960
Want to get some juice?

310
15:45.790 --> 15:48.660
Now that I think about it, my mouth is dry.

311
15:51.500 --> 15:52.290
Aww.

312
15:52.370 --> 15:53.860
Most of them are sold out.

313
15:54.580 --> 15:57.950
I really wanted to get something cold.

314
15:58.040 --> 15:59.410
But all they have is...

315
15:59.500 --> 16:03.430
Sweet red bean soup and whatever that is!

316
16:03.910 --> 16:05.510
What do we do?

317
16:05.910 --> 16:06.870
I need something,

318
16:06.950 --> 16:08.910
but I'm in a no-win situation here!

319
16:10.660 --> 16:12.500
A "no-win situation"?

320
16:14.540 --> 16:16.700
Should we find another vending machine?

321
16:17.250 --> 16:18.750
Nah.

322
16:18.830 --> 16:21.060
I'm thirsty, so I guess...

323
16:21.370 --> 16:23.750
...I'll just go for this one.

324
16:30.540 --> 16:32.200
Gross.

325
16:34.290 --> 16:36.080
With a name like that, duh.

326
16:36.160 --> 16:37.200
On any other day,

327
16:37.290 --> 16:39.520
I'd completely regret buying this.

328
16:39.830 --> 16:42.770
But now I know for sure that my new plan will work!

329
16:43.790 --> 16:45.290
Hey, Takagi.

330
16:45.370 --> 16:46.500
Hmm?

331
16:46.580 --> 16:49.870
Say there's one juice that's
really tasty but gives you a fever.

332
16:49.870 --> 16:52.090
And another that's just plain disgusting.

333
16:52.500 --> 16:54.450
Which would you choose?

334
16:56.000 --> 16:57.450
Hmm...

335
17:02.870 --> 17:05.750
One juice that's really tasty but gives you a fever

336
17:05.830 --> 17:08.850
and another that's just plain disgusting?

337
17:09.120 --> 17:09.910
Hmm...

338
17:10.000 --> 17:10.870
How's it feel?

339
17:10.950 --> 17:13.000
You can't decide, can you?

340
17:13.080 --> 17:14.120
Feel the unease!

341
17:14.200 --> 17:17.790
I want to see your face contorted
with conflicting emotions!

342
17:17.790 --> 17:19.200
'Kay, question.

343
17:20.410 --> 17:23.580
So if I drank the tasty juice and got a fever.

344
17:23.660 --> 17:26.160
Would you come and visit me while I'm stuck at home?

345
17:26.250 --> 17:27.200
What?

346
17:27.290 --> 17:29.000
What's the point in asking me that?

347
17:29.080 --> 17:30.620
Does it affect your answer?

348
17:30.700 --> 17:33.040
Significantly.

349
17:33.120 --> 17:34.620
You wouldn't visit, then?

350
17:34.700 --> 17:37.040
Uh.

351
17:37.120 --> 17:39.950
Hey. I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth.

352
17:40.040 --> 17:42.420
If you were out sick, then I'd visit you.

353
17:43.080 --> 17:45.660
Then I'd take the tasty one.

354
17:49.700 --> 17:51.500
Well, this is weird.

355
17:51.580 --> 17:53.790
What's going on?

356
17:53.870 --> 17:55.660
I expected her to be conflicted,

357
17:55.750 --> 17:57.910
but she doesn't have a care in the world.

358
17:58.000 --> 17:59.040
Hold on.

359
17:59.120 --> 18:01.000
I feel a little weird now.

360
18:01.080 --> 18:03.540
Am I the loser here?

361
18:03.620 --> 18:06.000
Has my "two-choice question" plan failed?

362
18:06.080 --> 18:09.410
No, it's still too early to give up!

363
18:09.500 --> 18:10.080
'Kay!

364
18:10.160 --> 18:11.660
Next question!

365
18:11.750 --> 18:12.790
Okay.

366
18:12.870 --> 18:14.750
No more allowance for your whole life,

367
18:14.830 --> 18:16.790
or no more teasing me ever?!

368
18:16.870 --> 18:18.450
No allowance for life.

369
18:18.540 --> 18:20.160
So quick!

370
18:20.250 --> 18:21.330
I'd be fine.

371
18:21.410 --> 18:24.790
I've been saving up my New Year's money
and anything else I've gotten for a while.

372
18:24.790 --> 18:27.330
And once I'm in high school, I'd just get a job.

373
18:27.410 --> 18:31.040
Clearly, the better choice is to keep teasing you.

374
18:31.120 --> 18:33.870
I underestimated her!

375
18:33.950 --> 18:35.660
I'll need a better question than that.

376
18:35.750 --> 18:36.700
Nishikata.

377
18:36.790 --> 18:38.120
What?

378
18:38.200 --> 18:40.620
Well, you've asked me two weird questions in a row.

379
18:40.700 --> 18:42.290
What's your angle?

380
18:42.370 --> 18:44.870
Are you just trying to give me a hard time?

381
18:44.950 --> 18:47.790
Huh?

382
18:47.870 --> 18:49.950
Not really.

383
18:50.040 --> 18:50.790
Fine.

384
18:50.870 --> 18:52.540
Then I'll ask you one, now.

385
18:52.620 --> 18:54.540
Would you rather that I disappear

386
18:54.620 --> 18:56.970
or that you'd have to be teased by me forever?

387
18:57.370 --> 18:58.750
What'll you choose?

388
18:58.830 --> 18:59.830
Huh?

389
18:59.910 --> 19:02.080
What do you mean "disappear?"

390
19:02.160 --> 19:04.000
Poof, I'm gone.

391
19:06.450 --> 19:08.620
I don't want to be teased for the rest of my life

392
19:08.700 --> 19:10.330
but for her to disappear?

393
19:10.410 --> 19:13.540
That feels like a step too far.

394
19:13.620 --> 19:16.540
I'd, uh, choose to be teased.

395
19:18.750 --> 19:19.580
Thought so.

396
19:19.660 --> 19:21.290
You do like being teased.

397
19:21.370 --> 19:22.290
No, I don't!

398
19:22.370 --> 19:24.410
Why would anyone like that?

399
19:24.500 --> 19:25.620
It's just...

400
19:25.700 --> 19:28.120
I don't exactly want you to disappear either.

401
19:28.200 --> 19:30.410
That would suck.

402
19:30.500 --> 19:31.620
You want to be with me?

403
19:31.700 --> 19:33.620
That it?

404
19:33.700 --> 19:34.540
That's not...

405
19:35.750 --> 19:37.290
Made you blush!

406
19:37.370 --> 19:39.370
Man, why does she always have to do this?

407
19:39.450 --> 19:42.910
Is it that fun to see me uncomfortable?

408
19:43.000 --> 19:45.660
I gotta come up with a good question to get back at her.

409
19:45.750 --> 19:46.790
Question two.

410
19:46.870 --> 19:48.620
Huh? You're not done?

411
19:48.700 --> 19:52.160
You get zeroes on all tests for the rest of your life,

412
19:52.250 --> 19:54.040
or you have kiss me.

413
19:54.120 --> 19:55.250
Which is it?

414
19:55.330 --> 19:57.500
A "kiss"?!

415
20:01.120 --> 20:03.580
Gotta choose one.

416
20:03.660 --> 20:06.120
I'd get a zero even if I study well?

417
20:06.200 --> 20:07.000
Yep.

418
20:07.080 --> 20:09.540
It doesn't matter what you do.

419
20:09.620 --> 20:10.950
I couldn't live with that!

420
20:11.040 --> 20:13.370
My parents would take away my allowance immediately,

421
20:13.450 --> 20:16.200
and there's no way I'd get into high school!

422
20:16.290 --> 20:18.410
But if choose the kiss,

423
20:18.500 --> 20:21.080
she's gonna make fun of me like there's no tomorrow!

424
20:21.160 --> 20:22.910
Hard decision, huh?

425
20:23.000 --> 20:24.330
Man!

426
20:24.410 --> 20:27.830
The more I struggle to choose, the happier she gets!

427
20:27.910 --> 20:29.580
I gotta choose quickly.

428
20:29.660 --> 20:31.790
All zeroes for life is too much!

429
20:31.870 --> 20:33.910
But!

430
20:34.000 --> 20:35.790
I have no choice!

431
20:35.870 --> 20:39.750
I'll pick not getting zeroes on my tests.

432
20:39.830 --> 20:42.660
Sorry, which option was that again?

433
20:44.950 --> 20:47.680
Th-The one with the kiss.

434
20:48.620 --> 20:53.040
Ho, ho?

435
20:53.120 --> 20:54.250
Is that so?

436
20:54.330 --> 20:55.830
Okay, then.

437
21:09.250 --> 21:10.450
Aww, man.

438
21:11.700 --> 21:12.700
Looks like you were right.

439
21:12.790 --> 21:15.040
You are taller than me.

440
21:16.660 --> 21:18.330
What's with that look?

441
21:18.410 --> 21:20.500
I was just making sure.

442
21:33.250 --> 21:36.240
She's messed with me so many times today.

443
21:39.120 --> 21:41.830
But I have this all figured out now.

444
21:41.910 --> 21:44.110
One option has to be something she'd never choose,

445
21:44.110 --> 21:47.040
and the other just has to be something
I can make fun of her for picking!

446
21:47.120 --> 21:49.200
That way, I win no matter what!

447
21:49.290 --> 21:51.050
Okay, Takagi. I got one--

448
21:51.050 --> 21:52.190
All right, next question.

449
21:54.120 --> 21:57.580
You have to go around the school while
doing a handstand, or you and I--

450
21:57.580 --> 22:00.780
Whoa, hold on a second! I can't even do a hand
stand, that option doesn't work!

451
22:01.080 --> 22:02.660
And when can I ask the questions again?

452
22:02.750 --> 22:04.500
As soon as you're done answering my questions.

453
22:04.580 --> 22:06.080
What? Why?

454
02:16.010 --> 02:20.010
<b>"Who's Taller?"</b>

455
07:24.940 --> 07:28.940
<b>"I Hate the Cold"</b>

456
09:35.990 --> 09:39.990
