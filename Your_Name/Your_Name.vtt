00:53.690 --> 00:55.170
Some mornings,

2
00:55.280 --> 00:57.400
I wake up crying without knowing why.

3
00:58.460 --> 01:00.870
That sort of thing happens now and again.

4
01:01.680 --> 01:03.810
Whatever the dream was I had,

5
01:03.930 --> 01:05.540
I can never remember it.

6
01:05.950 --> 01:07.420
But...

7
01:07.570 --> 01:08.720
But...

8
01:08.910 --> 01:12.030
The only thing that does last when I wake up

9
01:12.050 --> 01:13.710
This is a sense of loss

10
01:13.940 --> 01:17.040
which lingers for a long time afterwards.

11
01:23.570 --> 01:26.100
I'm always searching for something,

12
01:26.280 --> 01:27.740
or someone.

13
01:28.400 --> 01:31.070
I've been consumed by this feeling

14
01:31.400 --> 01:33.260
ever since that day.

15
01:34.520 --> 01:38.080
The day a star fell.

16
01:38.310 --> 01:39.840
It was almost like...

17
01:39.840 --> 01:43.110
...like seeing something out of a dream.

18
01:43.110 --> 01:45.610
Nothing more or less...

19
01:46.150 --> 01:48.960
...than a breathtaking view.

20
01:46.150 --> 01:48.960
...than a breathtaking view.

21
03:43.630 --> 03:44.880
Taki.

22
03:45.670 --> 03:46.740
Taki.

23
03:47.840 --> 03:49.060
Taki.

24
03:50.480 --> 03:52.250
Don't you remember?

25
03:54.880 --> 03:55.750
My name is...

26
03:57.970 --> 03:58.960
...Mitsuha!

27
04:35.160 --> 04:37.810
Sis, what are you doing?

28
04:37.810 --> 04:41.200
Whoa. They're so realistic feeling.

29
04:41.950 --> 04:44.010
"Sis"? Me?

30
04:44.010 --> 04:45.720
Are you still asleep?

31
04:45.720 --> 04:46.813
Breakfast time!

32
04:46.900 --> 04:48.140
Hurry up!

33
05:09.950 --> 05:13.330
Wha--? What?!

34
05:19.870 --> 05:22.330
Do you wanna have any a last night's fish, Grandma?

35
05:22.400 --> 05:23.490
You can eat it.

36
05:24.360 --> 05:26.190
Morning.

37
05:25.130 --> 05:26.190
Morning.

38
05:26.190 --> 05:28.600
Lazy butt! You're so slow!

39
05:27.820 --> 05:30.100
I'll fix breakfast tomorrow.

40
05:35.770 --> 05:37.100
Oh, that's a lot.

41
05:37.100 --> 05:38.160
Oh, well!

42
05:38.920 --> 05:40.510
You're back to normal today.

43
05:40.890 --> 05:43.180
You were so crazy yesterday.

44
05:43.180 --> 05:45.090
What do you mean "crazy"?

45
05:46.830 --> 05:48.680
Attention citizens of Itomori.

46
05:48.680 --> 05:49.780
Good morning.

47
05:50.400 --> 05:53.550
This is an official announcement from Itomori Town Hall.

48
05:54.250 --> 05:56.960
It is in regards to the mayoral election.

49
05:56.960 --> 06:00.100
The election will be held on the 20th of next month.

50
06:00.100 --> 06:03.500
The election committee would like to remind everyone that--

51
06:06.890 --> 06:09.950
A comet that comes only once every 1,200 years

52
06:10.050 --> 06:12.430
will finally be headed our way in a month.

53
06:12.650 --> 06:17.050
The comet will be visible to the naked eye for
several days once it approaches the Earth...

54
06:17.050 --> 06:19.130
Just make up with him already, okay?

55
06:19.130 --> 06:20.406
It's an adult matter.

56
06:20.431 --> 06:24.640
According to JAXA's spokesperson, they're
preparing for The celestia show of the millennium.

57
06:41.380 --> 06:42.500
We're leaving!

58
06:41.380 --> 06:42.500
We're leaving!

59
06:46.380 --> 06:47.920
I can't wait till the festival!

60
06:47.920 --> 06:49.380
It's gonna be so much fun!

61
07:03.380 --> 07:05.570
Study hard, Sis!

62
07:08.269 --> 07:08.916
Ow!

63
07:10.650 --> 07:12.070
Mitsuha!

64
07:12.070 --> 07:14.310
Good morning, Saya. Morning, Teshi.

65
07:14.310 --> 07:15.120
Morning.

66
07:15.120 --> 07:16.790
Come on! Would you get off already?

67
07:16.990 --> 07:18.120
What for, meanie?

68
07:18.120 --> 07:19.940
'Cause you're heavy.

69
07:19.080 --> 07:19.940
Hey, that's rude.`

70
07:19.950 --> 07:22.210
You know, I've gotta say, you two make a great couple.

71
07:22.210 --> 07:23.580
No we don't!

72
07:22.210 --> 07:23.580
No we don't!

73
07:25.970 --> 07:28.590
Oh, I see you actually bothered to do your hair today.

74
07:28.590 --> 07:29.750
Wait, what?

75
07:29.750 --> 07:32.800
Oh, yeah, what happened?
Did your grandma exorcise all your demons?

76
07:32.800 --> 07:33.560
Exorcise?

77
07:33.560 --> 07:35.670
Something totally possessed your body.

78
07:35.770 --> 07:38.720
Would just give it a rest with all this occult nonsense?

79
07:38.930 --> 07:41.460
Mitsuha's gotta be feeling stressed enough as it is,

80
07:41.370 --> 07:41.715
Right?

81
07:41.740 --> 07:43.830
What're you guys talking about?

82
07:43.830 --> 07:45.110
Are you feeling okay?

83
07:46.680 --> 07:47.920
And above all,

84
07:48.120 --> 07:53.550
restoring the town's fiscal health so we
can continue our revitalization project!

85
07:53.840 --> 07:56.120
It's only when all these things are achieved

86
07:56.120 --> 07:59.638
that we can create a safe and secure community!

87
07:59.839 --> 08:02.230
As the incumbent, my administration has...

88
08:02.240 --> 08:05.040
Miyamizu's gonna get another term anyway.

89
08:05.040 --> 08:07.630
I hear he's been doling out the pork, just between us.

90
08:08.060 --> 08:09.650
Hey, Miyamizu.

91
08:09.650 --> 08:10.880
Morning.

92
08:11.560 --> 08:14.750
Looks like the mayor and the
contractors' kid are pretty cozy too.

93
08:14.750 --> 08:16.140
Ew.

94
08:16.140 --> 08:18.640
...and improve the quality of
life of each and every resident.

95
08:20.610 --> 08:22.140
Mitsuha!

96
08:22.670 --> 08:24.320
Stand up straight when you're walking!

97
08:25.650 --> 08:27.360
Oh, he's tough on his family.

98
08:27.360 --> 08:28.650
Well, that's the mayor for ya.

99
08:28.930 --> 08:29.870
Awkward.

100
08:29.870 --> 08:31.150
Sucks to be her.

101
08:32.117 --> 08:33.230
Mitsuha.

102
08:34.560 --> 08:36.300
In front of everyone...

103
08:50.320 --> 08:53.670
"Two-light" That's the origin of the word "twilight."

104
08:53.670 --> 08:56.140
I'm sure everyone here knows that word.

105
08:56.700 --> 09:00.460
It's dusk. A time when it's neither day nor night.

106
09:00.460 --> 09:02.350
When the border between worlds blur,

107
09:02.350 --> 09:05.810
and one might encounter something not human.

108
09:06.300 --> 09:09.860
Another older term for it is "dusk-light."

109
09:09.890 --> 09:13.300
Some people also call it "golden hour."

110
09:13.340 --> 09:14.505
What about magic hour?

111
09:14.530 --> 09:16.224
It's something my grandma says.

112
09:16.300 --> 09:19.790
Well, golden hour and magic hour are technically the same.

113
09:19.840 --> 09:22.550
But it's a term that mostly photographers use.

114
09:23.100 --> 09:25.720
Well, she does take a lot of pictures.

115
09:28.020 --> 09:30.610
Okay, next, Miyamizu!

116
09:30.840 --> 09:32.410
Uh! Yes!

117
09:32.410 --> 09:35.650
Well, I can see that  you remember your own name today.

118
09:38.590 --> 09:40.820
You don't remember?

119
09:41.500 --> 09:45.480
Well, believe it or not, you forgot where
your own desk and locker were yesterday.

120
09:45.480 --> 09:49.500
Plus you had the worst case of bed head,
and you didn't have your ribbon on either.

121
09:52.230 --> 09:54.330
What? No way!

122
09:54.330 --> 09:57.060
Yeah, it was like you had amnesia or something.

123
09:57.060 --> 10:01.820
Now that you mention it, I do feel like
I've been having weird dreams lately.

124
10:01.820 --> 10:04.910
Like a dream about someone else's life?

125
10:05.770 --> 10:08.210
Ugh... It's all so fuzzy.

126
10:08.210 --> 10:10.680
Wait a sec. I've got it!

127
10:10.680 --> 10:12.480
It's memories from a previous life!

128
10:12.480 --> 10:16.290
Or maybe your subconscious linked to the
Everett interpretation of the multiverse!

129
10:16.290 --> 10:17.500
Keep your fool mouth shut!

130
10:17.500 --> 10:20.990
Wait a minute, Teshi! Don't tell me
you're the one who wrote in my notebook!

131
10:22.730 --> 10:24.290
Forget it.

132
10:24.650 --> 10:28.940
But you really were acting just a
little funny yesterday, Mitsuha.

133
10:28.940 --> 10:31.090
You been feeling okay?

134
10:32.060 --> 10:33.440
That's what's weird.

135
10:33.980 --> 10:35.410
I feel fine.

136
10:35.410 --> 10:37.090
Maybe it's from stress.

137
10:37.090 --> 10:39.570
Y'know, you've got that ritual coming soon, don'tcha?

138
10:39.570 --> 10:41.570
Aww! Don't remind me!

139
10:41.740 --> 10:43.900
I can't stand this place anymore.

140
10:44.000 --> 10:46.200
It's too small and towny.

141
10:46.200 --> 10:50.133
I wanna graduate already and
go to Tokyo as soon as I can!

142
10:50.680 --> 10:52.520
Can't say I blame you.

143
10:52.520 --> 10:55.260
There really is nothing at all in this town.

144
10:56.960 --> 10:59.680
There's only one train that stops here every two hours.

145
10:59.680 --> 11:01.470
And all the store closes at nine o'clock.

146
11:01.470 --> 11:03.470
No bookstores, no dentists.

147
11:03.470 --> 11:06.110
But two cocktail lounges for whatever reason.

148
11:06.110 --> 11:07.200
No jobs in town.

149
11:07.200 --> 11:08.230
No one datable.

150
11:08.230 --> 11:10.230
Even the days are too short!

151
11:12.330 --> 11:13.450
You know what?!

152
11:13.550 --> 11:14.680
No, what?

153
11:15.880 --> 11:18.350
Forget that stuff. Why don't we go to a café?

154
11:18.350 --> 11:19.740
A café?

155
11:18.710 --> 11:19.740
Really?

156
11:20.010 --> 11:21.240
Where!?

157
11:25.640 --> 11:26.760
Hello, kids.

158
11:26.780 --> 11:28.190
Evening, ma'm!

159
11:26.780 --> 11:28.190
Hi there!

160
11:33.030 --> 11:34.700
How is this a café?

161
11:34.700 --> 11:36.750
Like this town's got a café'.

162
11:36.980 --> 11:39.070
Mitsuha just went straight home.

163
11:40.460 --> 11:42.880
Things have gotta be really rough for her right now.

164
11:42.880 --> 11:45.440
She's on center stage and all.

165
11:45.440 --> 11:46.610
Yeah.

166
11:49.630 --> 11:51.240
Hey, Teshi.

167
11:52.970 --> 11:55.840
What're you gonna do after you graduate high school?

168
11:55.840 --> 11:57.150
Where'd that come from?

169
11:57.150 --> 11:58.440
You talking about the future?

170
12:00.440 --> 12:01.830
I don't know.

171
12:01.830 --> 12:05.640
I think I'll probably just end up living in this
town, you know? Same as ever.

172
12:21.720 --> 12:23.800
I wanna do what you're doing.

173
12:23.800 --> 12:26.550
It's still too soon for you to try, Yotsuha.

174
12:26.550 --> 12:29.210
Listen to the thread's voice.

175
12:29.210 --> 12:32.050
When you twine it round and round like this,

176
12:32.250 --> 12:35.800
feelings will start flowing between you and the thread.

177
12:35.800 --> 12:38.320
It's not like threads talk.

178
12:38.320 --> 12:40.590
She's telling you to focus.

179
12:40.590 --> 12:46.500
Etched within our braided cords is a
thousand years' worth of Itomori's history.

180
12:46.500 --> 12:50.330
Listen, something happened 200 years ago.

181
12:50.330 --> 12:52.070
Here she goes.

182
12:52.070 --> 12:56.130
The bathroom of sandal maker
Mayugoro Yamazaki caught on fire,

183
12:56.130 --> 12:59.170
and this whole area burned down.

184
12:59.170 --> 13:02.000
The shrine and old documents were destroyed.

185
13:02.620 --> 13:04.010
This is known as--

186
13:04.010 --> 13:05.770
Mayugoro's Great Fire.

187
13:05.810 --> 13:08.040
They named the fire after him?

188
13:08.040 --> 13:10.010
I feel bad for Mayugoro.

189
13:10.860 --> 13:15.120
The meaning behind our festivals was lost because of that.

190
13:15.120 --> 13:17.270
Only the surface was left.

191
13:17.760 --> 13:21.640
But even if those words are gone, the tradition shouldn't fade.

192
13:21.640 --> 13:26.530
That's the Miyamizu Shrine's duty, our important task.

193
13:28.580 --> 13:32.660
Despite all that, that son-in-law of mine--

194
13:32.660 --> 13:38.300
Abandoning the Shinto priesthood and leaving
this house were bad enough, but politics?

195
13:38.300 --> 13:40.340
Oh! He's hopeless.

196
13:41.270 --> 13:43.060
Have another, Mr. Foreman.

197
13:43.060 --> 13:45.310
The site we've got is a tricky one, that's for sure.

198
13:45.310 --> 13:46.620
Whoa!

199
13:46.620 --> 13:49.200
I'll be counting on your help again for this election.

200
13:49.200 --> 13:50.300
Leave it to me.

201
13:50.300 --> 13:54.240
You'll get the votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami districts, guaranteed.

202
13:54.240 --> 13:55.610
How's the dating scene?

203
13:55.610 --> 13:56.990
It ain’t easy, that's for sure!

204
13:59.240 --> 14:01.460
Smells like corruption in there.

205
14:01.460 --> 14:03.320
What're you talking about?

206
14:03.670 --> 14:05.860
We're gonna need two or three more bottles.

207
14:05.860 --> 14:07.270
Yes, dear.

208
14:07.270 --> 14:09.930
Katsuhiko, you're gonna help out at the site this weekend.

209
14:09.930 --> 14:12.900
We'll be using explosives, so you better study up.

210
14:13.300 --> 14:14.420
What was that?

211
14:14.420 --> 14:15.320
Got it!

212
14:28.880 --> 14:31.720
Guess we both can't stand things here.

213
14:50.050 --> 14:51.660
Is that Yotsuha?

214
14:51.660 --> 14:53.050
She's all grown up.

215
14:53.050 --> 14:55.880
They're lookers all right, just like their mother.

216
14:57.470 --> 14:58.260
Hey-a.

217
14:58.800 --> 14:59.620
Hey.

218
15:32.120 --> 15:34.440
World's oldest kind of saké.

219
15:34.640 --> 15:40.600
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and then
letting it ferment naturally, it becomes alcohol.

220
15:40.600 --> 15:42.580
<i>Kuchikamizake.</i>

221
15:42.580 --> 15:44.990
Do the gods really appreciate that?

222
15:44.990 --> 15:45.850
The way it's...

223
15:45.850 --> 15:47.280
Yeah! Of course they do!

224
15:49.510 --> 15:51.640
Hey, check it out. It's Miyamizu.

225
15:57.510 --> 15:59.850
Uh! I'd never do that!

226
15:59.850 --> 16:01.640
And in front of everybody.

227
16:01.640 --> 16:03.200
Embarrassing, right?

228
16:17.540 --> 16:19.300
You should try to cheer up, Sis.

229
16:19.880 --> 16:22.900
Who cares if a few of the kids from your school saw all that?

230
16:22.900 --> 16:25.700
It must be nice for you, not being a teenager.

231
16:26.180 --> 16:27.440
Hey, I know,

232
16:27.440 --> 16:29.540
you should just sell <i>kuchikamizake</i>

233
16:29.540 --> 16:30.890
and move to Tokyo.

234
16:30.890 --> 16:35.760
I bet you could sell it with all sorts of
stuff, like photos and making-of videos.

235
16:35.760 --> 16:39.013
Oh! And then you could call it "Shrine Maiden Saké."

236
16:39.270 --> 16:41.000
You'll make butt-loads!

237
16:44.210 --> 16:46.530
I can't! There are liquor laws!

238
16:48.090 --> 16:49.900
That's what you have a problem with?

239
16:56.260 --> 16:58.300
I hate this town!

240
16:58.830 --> 17:01.260
I hate this life too!

241
17:01.260 --> 17:05.770
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!

242
17:09.900 --> 17:11.580
What a jackass.

243
17:43.380 --> 17:45.100
Ouch...

244
17:54.080 --> 17:55.100
Where?

245
18:06.370 --> 18:08.450
Somethings... there.

246
18:22.580 --> 18:23.540
Ow!

247
18:23.540 --> 18:25.220
Taki! You up?

248
18:27.810 --> 18:30.040
It was your turn to cook breakfast, wasn't it?

249
18:30.040 --> 18:31.180
Did you sleep in?

250
18:31.180 --> 18:32.540
Uh. I'm sorry.

251
18:33.890 --> 18:35.510
Uh, I'm heading out.

252
18:35.510 --> 18:37.300
Finish the miso.

253
18:37.750 --> 18:38.550
O-Okay.

254
18:38.860 --> 18:41.460
Make sure that you go to school even if you're late.

255
18:41.700 --> 18:42.290
See ya.

256
18:43.260 --> 18:44.730
Have a nice day!

257
18:55.810 --> 18:57.440
What a weird dream.

258
19:03.080 --> 19:07.540
Huh? It's from... Tsukasa? Who's that?

259
19:17.260 --> 19:19.090
I gotta go pee.

260
19:28.000 --> 19:29.470
Way too real.

261
20:40.710 --> 20:42.910
I'm in Tokyo!

262
20:49.680 --> 20:51.320
Where did you get this?

263
20:51.080 --> 20:52.630
Daikanyama.

264
20:51.680 --> 20:53.690
Guess who's opening our next gig?

265
20:53.690 --> 20:56.780
Hey, it's skip club stuff today and catch a movie.

266
21:01.560 --> 21:02.690
Taki.

267
21:04.200 --> 21:06.210
Can't believe you got in at noon.

268
21:06.240 --> 21:08.000
Come on, let's grab lunch!

269
21:08.610 --> 21:10.720
You ignored my text too.

270
21:11.070 --> 21:12.380
Uh, Mister Tsukasa?

271
21:12.380 --> 21:14.710
"Mister"? You don't have to go that far.

272
21:16.650 --> 21:18.080
You got lost?

273
21:18.080 --> 21:19.050
Yeah.

274
21:19.070 --> 21:19.930
Wait a second,

275
21:19.930 --> 21:22.730
how'd you wind up getting lost on the way to school?

276
21:22.730 --> 21:25.630
Uh, well, a girl--

277
21:25.630 --> 21:26.380
A girl?

278
21:26.380 --> 21:27.390
Uh, a gal.

279
21:28.390 --> 21:29.140
I mean--

280
21:30.150 --> 21:30.980
A guy!

281
21:33.350 --> 21:35.180
You know, guys just wanna have fun!

282
21:35.180 --> 21:39.070
Every day's a festival when
you're living in Tokyo. As a guy.

283
21:39.480 --> 21:41.970
Hey, you sound funny.

284
21:42.070 --> 21:44.010
And where's your lunch?

285
21:44.010 --> 21:45.130
Seriously?

286
21:45.130 --> 21:46.860
What is up with you?

287
21:46.860 --> 21:47.830
We can share something.

288
21:47.830 --> 21:50.130
Let's make a croquette-egg sandwich.

289
21:50.290 --> 21:51.940
Yes! Ha, ha!

290
21:54.330 --> 21:55.830
Thank you.

291
21:57.640 --> 21:59.080
Wanna hit the café later?

292
21:59.080 --> 22:01.890
Oh, that one? Sure. You in, Taki?

293
22:01.890 --> 22:02.640
What? What?

294
22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
What!?

295
22:04.840 --> 22:06.340
A café!?

296
22:09.530 --> 22:11.320
They've got nice timber-work in here.

297
22:11.320 --> 22:13.680
Yeah, it's pretty intricate.

298
22:13.680 --> 22:15.300
Taki, all set?

299
22:17.050 --> 22:20.860
I could live for a whole month
on what these pancakes cost!

300
22:21.130 --> 22:23.740
Uh, maybe a decade ago.

301
22:25.630 --> 22:27.610
Oh, well! It's only a dream!

302
22:33.940 --> 22:35.630
Dreams are great.

303
22:41.080 --> 22:42.920
What? Oh, no!

304
22:42.920 --> 22:44.610
I think that I'm late for work!

305
22:44.850 --> 22:46.380
You've got a shift today?

306
22:46.700 --> 22:48.120
Guess you'd better get going.

307
22:48.120 --> 22:48.930
Uh, Right.

308
22:50.170 --> 22:52.390
Uh, sorry, but uh--

309
22:53.520 --> 22:56.560
Where exactly do I work?

310
23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
Tables six, seven, and ten are waiting!

311
23:05.900 --> 23:06.900
Three new diners!

312
23:06.400 --> 23:07.980
Table 12! Taki!

313
23:07.980 --> 23:09.390
Got it!

314
23:09.390 --> 23:10.890
Here you go.

315
23:10.890 --> 23:13.910
So the zucchini and tomato salad with a side...

316
23:13.910 --> 23:15.410
We didn't order that.
Wha--?

317
23:15.410 --> 23:18.140
Taki! I told you that we were out of truffles!

318
23:18.140 --> 23:20.260
Taki, you've gotta talk louder!

319
23:20.260 --> 23:20.920
Taki!

320
23:22.480 --> 23:24.920
When is this nightmare gonna be over?

321
23:33.350 --> 23:35.510
Waiter. Hey, you!

322
23:35.540 --> 23:36.950
Uh, yes?

323
23:38.670 --> 23:42.440
See this? Does it look right? A toothpick's in it.

324
23:42.440 --> 23:45.010
What would've happened if we ate it?

325
23:45.620 --> 23:47.950
It's really lucky I noticed when I did.

326
23:48.940 --> 23:50.000
Do something.

327
23:50.000 --> 23:52.180
Um... it's just that--

328
23:52.580 --> 23:53.860
Well,

329
23:54.110 --> 23:57.010
I don't even think we have toothpicks at this--

330
23:56.900 --> 23:57.490
What?!

331
23:58.660 --> 24:00.460
Excuse me.

332
24:00.460 --> 24:02.310
Is everything all right over here?

333
24:02.310 --> 24:03.160
Well...

334
24:03.240 --> 24:04.460
I'll take care of this.

335
24:06.060 --> 24:07.650
What's wrong with you today?

336
24:09.240 --> 24:10.950
We truly apologize.

337
24:10.950 --> 24:12.650
Your meal is on the house tonight.

338
24:12.650 --> 24:13.470
Why, thank you.

339
24:13.820 --> 24:15.900
You weren't hurt, were you?

340
24:26.480 --> 24:27.750
Um...

341
24:27.750 --> 24:28.720
Okudera...

342
24:28.720 --> 24:30.090
That's "Miss" to you.

343
24:30.740 --> 24:32.920
Miss Okudera, about before--

344
24:32.920 --> 24:34.500
We just had some bad luck is all.

345
24:34.500 --> 24:35.560
No, I--

346
24:35.560 --> 24:37.740
Those guys were definitely scamming us.

347
24:37.740 --> 24:40.450
I handled it according to the manual, but still...

348
24:42.250 --> 24:44.300
Miss Okudera, your skirt!

349
24:45.640 --> 24:46.710
Are you all right?

350
24:46.710 --> 24:47.770
Did something happen?

351
24:47.770 --> 24:49.570
Looks like someone cut it.

352
24:49.570 --> 24:50.920
That guy.

353
24:50.920 --> 24:53.630
What now? Do you remember what he looked like?

354
24:53.630 --> 24:54.050
No...

355
24:54.870 --> 24:55.790
Come with me.

356
24:56.740 --> 24:58.190
Hey, Taki!

357
24:59.240 --> 25:00.840
Okay, take off your skirt!

358
25:00.840 --> 25:01.540
What?!

359
25:01.800 --> 25:03.940
I'll-I'll look the other way!

360
25:07.520 --> 25:09.450
Hold on. This won't take long.

361
25:13.880 --> 25:15.720
All done! Ta-da!

362
25:16.670 --> 25:17.950
You're really good, Taki!

363
25:17.950 --> 25:19.950
It's way cuter now!

364
25:21.650 --> 25:24.800
By the way, I wanted to thank you for
all your help with that customer earlier.

365
25:26.760 --> 25:30.890
To be honest, well, I was worried about you.

366
25:30.890 --> 25:34.050
You aren't that strong, but you're quick to pick a fight.

367
25:34.460 --> 25:36.470
Heh. I like you better today.

368
25:37.300 --> 25:40.580
You've got a feminine side. Who would a guessed?

369
25:51.200 --> 25:54.760
I gotta say, this dream sure does seem real.

370
25:59.080 --> 26:01.510
Ah, looks like he keeps a journal.

371
26:06.240 --> 26:08.000
So organized.

372
26:08.300 --> 26:10.480
I wish I lived in Tokyo.

373
26:14.440 --> 26:15.960
One of her!

374
26:20.880 --> 26:22.700
Unrequited love?

375
27:06.360 --> 27:07.890
What is this?

376
27:12.360 --> 27:14.900
Wha–? What?

377
27:14.900 --> 27:16.760
What is going on?

378
27:18.400 --> 27:19.920
So café today?

379
27:19.920 --> 27:22.240
Thanks, but I gotta go to work.

380
27:22.440 --> 27:24.230
Ha! Do you remember where to go?

381
27:26.470 --> 27:30.480
Wait a second, was that you, Tsukasa?
Are you the one that's been messing with my phone?

382
27:30.790 --> 27:34.360
Uh. Never mind. Later.

383
27:35.060 --> 27:37.630
Well, he's back to normal.

384
27:37.630 --> 27:40.480
I think he was kinda... cute yesterday.

385
27:45.110 --> 27:46.130
What's up?

386
27:46.130 --> 27:48.550
Don't play dumb! What about bro code, huh?

387
27:48.550 --> 27:50.270
You walked home with her yesterday, right?

388
27:52.960 --> 27:55.560
What're you talking about? Me and Miss Okudera?

389
27:55.560 --> 27:57.090
So what did you guys do?

390
27:57.090 --> 28:00.670
Uh, well, I don't remember actually.

391
28:00.670 --> 28:02.540
Quit messing around and tell us!

392
28:02.540 --> 28:04.950
Okudera, reporting for duty!

393
28:05.950 --> 28:07.690
Don't slack off today, you guys.

394
28:07.000 --> 28:08.110
Yeah.

395
28:08.710 --> 28:10.500
We're gonna have a good day today.

396
28:11.250 --> 28:13.110
Aren't we, Taki?

397
28:26.750 --> 28:29.910
I see you're not touching your boobies today.

398
28:29.910 --> 28:30.890
Breakfast time!

399
28:31.260 --> 28:32.310
Hurry up!

400
28:35.630 --> 28:37.410
My boobs?

401
28:39.230 --> 28:40.390
Morning.

402
28:46.540 --> 28:49.810
I feel like everyone's staring at me for some reason.

403
28:50.010 --> 28:53.010
Well, ya did kinda make a scene yesterday.

404
28:53.010 --> 28:53.670
Huh?

405
28:55.940 --> 28:58.140
Did you see all the election posters?

406
28:58.140 --> 29:01.560
Doesn't matter who wins,nothing I change.
Except for who gets the gift bag.

407
29:01.560 --> 29:04.550
Shh! Somebody's daddy's depending on it.

408
29:05.800 --> 29:08.160
They're talking about me, right?

409
29:10.660 --> 29:12.110
Wait! Mitsuha?

410
29:22.970 --> 29:25.220
I-- I...

411
29:25.220 --> 29:27.190
I did what?

412
29:29.350 --> 29:30.170
Mitsuha?

413
29:37.680 --> 29:40.500
Could this--? Could this mean--?

414
29:40.580 --> 29:42.210
No, no, no, no!

415
29:42.580 --> 29:45.450
Could this mean... that we're really--?

416
29:45.450 --> 29:47.920
That we're...? In our dreams, that guy and I...

417
29:48.380 --> 29:50.850
That we're--? In our dreams, that girl and I...

418
29:52.020 --> 29:53.520
We're switching places?!

419
29:52.020 --> 29:53.520
We're switching places?!

420
30:27.810 --> 30:30.840
I'm slowly beginning to get what's going on.

421
30:30.840 --> 30:33.210
Taki's in high school and living in Tokyo.

422
30:34.710 --> 30:38.430
Two or three times a week,
I'll suddenly and randomly switch with Mitsuha,

423
30:38.430 --> 30:40.310
who's somewhere out in the boonies.

424
30:40.310 --> 30:43.980
The trigger is sleep. The cause is unknown.

425
30:43.980 --> 30:46.130
Any memories I have of the switch

426
30:46.130 --> 30:48.820
get more and more hazy after I wake up.

427
30:48.820 --> 30:51.800
But there's no doubt that we're switching places.

428
30:52.330 --> 30:54.830
The reactions of everyone around us prove it.

429
30:54.830 --> 30:56.330
That's why--

430
30:56.330 --> 30:58.780
That's why we decided to lay out some rules

431
30:58.780 --> 31:01.170
so we could protect each other's way of life.

432
31:01.610 --> 31:03.710
Things to watch out for during the switches,

433
31:03.700 --> 31:05.900
and a list of stuff we should never do.

434
31:06.480 --> 31:10.470
We also agreed to leave each other reports
on our phones on the days we switch places.

435
31:11.140 --> 31:15.430
So that we can work together to get
through this weird thing that's happening.

436
31:16.020 --> 31:17.520
And yet--

437
31:17.520 --> 31:19.020
And yet--

438
31:19.020 --> 31:21.770
I cannot believe this guy!

439
31:19.020 --> 31:21.770
I cannot believe this girl!

440
31:36.180 --> 31:37.400
Guys'll stare.

441
31:37.700 --> 31:40.960
Watch the skirt! These are basics for a girl!

442
31:43.630 --> 31:45.970
Stop wasting my money on sweets!

443
31:45.970 --> 31:49.050
It's going in your body! Plus I also work for that money.

444
31:49.050 --> 31:51.020
Braiding cords is impossible!

445
31:51.020 --> 31:53.020
You work way too many shifts!

446
31:53.020 --> 31:54.640
'Cause you keep wasting money!

447
32:14.850 --> 32:17.290
Had tea with Miss Okudera on the way home.

448
32:17.560 --> 32:19.410
You two have a good thing going.

449
32:19.410 --> 32:22.920
Quit messing with my relationships, Mitsuha!

450
32:22.920 --> 32:26.640
Hey, Taki, why's a girl confessing her love to me?

451
32:26.690 --> 32:29.410
Maybe you're just more popular when I'm you.

452
32:29.410 --> 32:32.430
You're so full of yourself! Like you have a girlfriend.

453
32:32.430 --> 32:33.720
It's not like you have anyone either!

454
32:33.720 --> 32:34.800
I don't...

455
32:34.800 --> 32:35.550
I don't...

456
32:35.550 --> 32:37.560
Because I don't want a relationship!

457
32:35.550 --> 32:37.560
Because I don't want a relationship!

458
32:42.810 --> 32:44.810


459
32:59.240 --> 33:00.910
I shouldn't for her sake.

460
33:05.170 --> 33:07.570
You sure do like your own boobies.

461
33:07.710 --> 33:09.960
Time to go! Get ready!

462
33:13.080 --> 33:17.380
Over the course of the last few days,
the Tia-mat comet has been visible.

463
33:17.380 --> 33:19.210
But when and where can people see it?

464
33:19.840 --> 33:25.000
The Tia-mat comet will be moving in the same direction
the sun does, from east to west from our point of view.

465
33:25.000 --> 33:27.200
So right after sunset. As for where...

466
33:27.240 --> 33:29.580
Why're you wearing your uniform?

467
33:37.520 --> 33:42.910
Grandma? Why does our shrine god's
relic have to be kept so far away?

468
33:42.910 --> 33:46.340
'Cause of Mayugoro, I don't really know.

469
33:46.620 --> 33:47.770
Who's Mayugoro?

470
33:47.770 --> 33:49.810
What? He's famous!

471
33:57.870 --> 33:59.610
Hop on, Grandma.

472
34:04.180 --> 34:06.770
Oh!

473
34:04.930 --> 34:06.770
Watch out! Careful!

474
34:17.720 --> 34:22.080
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know about Musubi?

475
34:22.190 --> 34:23.140
Musubi?

476
34:23.210 --> 34:28.890
It's what we used to call the local guardian
deity long ago and it means "union."

477
34:28.890 --> 34:31.790
This word has profound meaning.

478
34:32.180 --> 34:35.140
Tying strings together is a union.

479
34:35.140 --> 34:37.650
Connecting to people is a union.

480
34:37.740 --> 34:40.320
And the flow of time is a union.

481
34:40.750 --> 34:44.160
These are all part of the god's power.

482
34:44.190 --> 34:47.510
The braided cords that we make are tied to that.

483
34:47.510 --> 34:52.860
A skill from the god,
they represent the flow of time itself.

484
34:53.820 --> 34:56.320
They assemble and take shape.

485
34:56.550 --> 34:58.890
They twist, tangle,

486
34:59.110 --> 35:03.170
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

487
35:04.080 --> 35:07.960
That's what a union is. What time is.

488
35:11.030 --> 35:12.100
Have a drink.

489
35:12.100 --> 35:13.370
Thanks.

490
35:14.410 --> 35:15.870
I want some too!

491
35:15.870 --> 35:18.300
That's also a union.

492
35:19.600 --> 35:22.360
Whether it's water, rice, or saké,

493
35:22.360 --> 35:27.850
when something becomes a part of a
person, it's a union, it joins their soul.

494
35:27.850 --> 35:30.520
Which is why the offering we're making today

495
35:30.520 --> 35:32.710
is such an important custom.

496
35:32.710 --> 35:36.170
It connects the god with people.

497
35:37.880 --> 35:39.460
Hey, I can see it!

498
35:42.740 --> 35:44.220
This is where it is.

499
35:44.450 --> 35:47.620
The sacred relic of Miyamizu Shrine.

500
36:04.160 --> 36:07.470
What lies ahead is the hereafter.

501
36:08.270 --> 36:10.210
It's the netherworld.

502
36:11.270 --> 36:13.610
The netherworld!

503
36:16.200 --> 36:23.310
In order to return to this world,
you have to leave behind what is most important to you.

504
36:25.020 --> 36:27.170
Like the <i>kuchikamizake</i> .

505
36:28.110 --> 36:30.110
<i>Kuchikamizake</i> ?

506
36:30.110 --> 36:33.910
You'll offer it at the foot of the shrine god's relic.

507
36:33.910 --> 36:37.040
After all, it is half of you.

508
36:38.470 --> 36:41.390
Half... of Mitsuha.

509
36:58.980 --> 37:01.120
Wow! It's already magic hour!

510
37:01.420 --> 37:03.430
Hm? Magic hour?

511
37:13.740 --> 37:14.750
Oh, yeah!

512
37:14.960 --> 37:16.580
Maybe I can see the comet.

513
37:17.960 --> 37:19.590
The comet?

514
37:20.270 --> 37:21.450
Oh,

515
37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
Mitsuha,

516
37:23.480 --> 37:26.970
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

517
37:37.900 --> 37:39.200
I'm crying?

518
37:39.700 --> 37:40.750
But why?

519
37:45.800 --> 37:47.150
Miss Okudera?

520
37:47.920 --> 37:49.350
She's almost where?

521
37:50.730 --> 37:52.960
Oh, Mitsuha, what did you do?

522
37:54.270 --> 37:55.160
Date?!

523
38:02.860 --> 38:05.620
Tomorrow's your Tokyo date with Miss Okudera!

524
38:06.250 --> 38:08.510
Meet up at the station at 10:30!

525
38:10.100 --> 38:13.340
Well, that's what I had planned, but--

526
38:27.010 --> 38:28.530
Hi, Taki!

527
38:30.200 --> 38:31.600
Wait long?

528
38:31.600 --> 38:33.920
Yeah. Uh, no.

529
38:43.780 --> 38:45.180
I just got here.

530
38:45.180 --> 38:47.450
Thank goodness. Let's go.

531
38:49.400 --> 38:50.910
Must be nice.

532
38:51.270 --> 38:53.410
They've probably met up about now.

533
38:56.830 --> 38:57.830
Huh?

534
39:01.920 --> 39:03.570
Why am I...?

535
39:04.360 --> 39:05.560
Why?

536
39:12.170 --> 39:14.580
It was a date I wanted to go on,

537
39:14.580 --> 39:16.770
but if it so happens you end up going,

538
39:16.770 --> 39:19.240
you'd better be grateful and enjoy it!

539
39:20.080 --> 39:23.090
This is a nice. It's my first time here.

540
39:23.510 --> 39:25.590
So is this one of your usual go-to spots, Taki?

541
39:24.500 --> 39:29.090
At any rate, I bet you've never even been on a single date.

542
39:27.680 --> 39:29.090
No wait. It's too expensive!

543
39:30.880 --> 39:33.110
I don't know what to say to her.

544
39:33.110 --> 39:37.720
That's why I've hand-picked some links
below to help you out, you wall flower.

545
39:37.720 --> 39:38.620
For real?

546
39:46.250 --> 39:48.370
She's making fun of me.

547
40:17.170 --> 40:18.410
You know something, Taki?

548
40:19.600 --> 40:22.900
Today you're... you're like a different person.

549
40:32.310 --> 40:33.760
Um, Miss Okudera,

550
40:33.760 --> 40:37.210
You getting hungry? We could get dinner.

551
40:38.910 --> 40:40.730
Uh. Let's call it a day.

552
40:42.430 --> 40:43.350
All right.

553
40:43.900 --> 40:45.220
I could be wrong,

554
40:45.780 --> 40:47.250
and I'm sorry if I am.

555
40:47.250 --> 40:47.980
About?

556
40:48.710 --> 40:52.450
But you used to have a little crush on me, am I right?

557
40:53.730 --> 40:56.730
But right now, there's someone else you like, huh?

558
40:56.730 --> 41:00.520
No. No, it's not that.

559
41:00.520 --> 41:01.560
Really?

560
41:01.560 --> 41:03.940
There's no one. It's not like that.

561
41:03.940 --> 41:05.960
Are you sure about that?

562
41:07.220 --> 41:10.560
Well, thanks for today! See you at work.

563
41:25.460 --> 41:27.550
By the time the date's over...

564
41:27.550 --> 41:30.400
...you should be able to see the comet in the sky.

565
41:33.970 --> 41:36.280
What does she mean? Weirdo.

566
42:05.030 --> 42:07.250
Oh, it's you, Teshi.

567
42:07.930 --> 42:08.760
No,

568
42:09.040 --> 42:12.330
I just didn't feel like going, that's all. I'm fine.

569
42:13.260 --> 42:15.650
What? The festival?

570
42:18.250 --> 42:19.850
Oh, yeah, the comet.

571
42:19.850 --> 42:22.420
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

572
42:22.790 --> 42:26.170
Okay, got it. See ya later.

573
42:29.690 --> 42:33.470
You're just looking forward to seeing
Mitsuha in a yukata, aren'tcha?

574
42:33.470 --> 42:35.000
I-I am not!

575
42:35.090 --> 42:37.320
I mean, it didn't even cross my mind.

576
42:38.300 --> 42:41.510
Y'know, she sounded kinda down when I talked to her.

577
42:41.510 --> 42:43.590
Maybe she just didn't want a call from ya.

578
42:43.590 --> 42:44.780
It's not funny!

579
42:44.780 --> 42:45.850
Sorry to keep ya.

580
42:45.850 --> 42:47.460
Oh, she's here!

581
42:46.220 --> 42:47.460
You're late.

582
42:49.900 --> 42:52.780
Mitsuha, what happened to--?

583
42:53.860 --> 42:55.180
Your hair!

584
42:55.730 --> 42:58.560
I guess... it's weird.

585
43:07.370 --> 43:09.440
You think it's gotta do with some guy?

586
43:09.440 --> 43:11.020
Like... he broke her heart?

587
43:11.020 --> 43:13.990
Guys always just assume that it has to do with a boy.

588
43:14.230 --> 43:16.520
She said she felt like cutting it.

589
43:16.520 --> 43:20.140
Ya sure about that? You really think she
felt like cutting off that much of it?

590
43:21.240 --> 43:22.990
Hey, guys! I can see it!

591
43:41.500 --> 43:43.290
Whoa.

592
44:01.820 --> 44:05.810
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network

593
44:05.810 --> 44:07.740
or has been turned off due--

594
44:10.040 --> 44:14.150
I'll just have to tell her how lousy the
date ended up the next time we switch.

595
44:15.080 --> 44:16.460
That's what I thought.

596
44:17.290 --> 44:18.080
But--

597
44:18.500 --> 44:24.300
For some reason, the switches Mitsuha
and I'd been going through until now...

598
44:24.300 --> 44:25.900
they never happened again.

599
46:18.930 --> 46:19.780
Wha--?

600
46:20.320 --> 46:23.520
What're--? What're you doing here?

601
46:26.010 --> 46:29.010
Tsukasa told me, so here I am.

602
46:32.560 --> 46:34.280
I asked for two things.

603
46:34.570 --> 46:37.850
To cover my shift,
and to back up my alibi if my dad asked.

604
46:37.880 --> 46:39.980
Relax, Takagi's gonna take your shift.

605
46:39.520 --> 46:42.770
Gotcha covered! But you owe me dinner!

606
46:42.920 --> 46:44.910
So you're all in on it.

607
46:44.910 --> 46:46.660
You've got everyone worried about you.

608
46:46.660 --> 46:47.330
Huh?

609
46:47.330 --> 46:50.580
We can't ignore this. What if somebody's
trying to pull one over on you?

610
46:50.580 --> 46:51.830
Like catfish?

611
46:51.830 --> 46:54.200
I mean you met this person online, didn't you?

612
46:54.200 --> 46:56.570
No, not exactly! It's kinda complicated.

613
46:56.570 --> 46:58.810
Could be from a dating site.

614
46:57.700 --> 46:58.810
She's not!

615
46:59.610 --> 47:01.790
It's because you've been acting awfully fishy lately.

616
47:01.790 --> 47:03.530
So we're keeping an eye on you.

617
47:03.530 --> 47:05.300
I don't need a baby sitter, okay?

618
47:07.400 --> 47:09.200
The switches stopped.

619
47:09.200 --> 47:12.860
My calls never connected and texts never went through.

620
47:12.860 --> 47:15.820
That's why I decided to go see Mitsuha in person.

621
47:17.430 --> 47:19.200
I wanted to see her.

622
47:19.630 --> 47:20.560
But...

623
47:22.240 --> 47:23.090
What?

624
47:23.330 --> 47:25.310
You don't know where she is exactly?

625
47:25.310 --> 47:27.780
The town's landscape is your only clue?

626
47:27.780 --> 47:28.590
Yeah.

627
47:31.300 --> 47:33.090
And you can't contact her?

628
47:33.450 --> 47:34.930
What's that about?

629
47:35.380 --> 47:37.860
Where are we? You're a terrible tour guide.

630
47:37.360 --> 47:39.160
'Cause I'm not one!

631
47:39.160 --> 47:42.580
Oh, well. Guess we'll help you search.

632
47:42.580 --> 47:45.200
Ah! It's so cute! Look, Taki!

633
47:45.760 --> 47:47.210
Seriously, guys?

634
47:46.880 --> 47:48.530
It moved! Aw!

635
48:17.000 --> 48:19.280
This is a lost cause.

636
48:19.280 --> 48:23.120
What? After everything that we've done for you today?

637
48:25.780 --> 48:27.950
You haven't done anything.

638
48:31.510 --> 48:33.080
One Takayama ramen.

639
48:33.080 --> 48:34.640
One Takayama ramen.

640
48:34.640 --> 48:36.480
I guess I'll have the same.

641
48:36.480 --> 48:37.240
Sure.

642
48:37.730 --> 48:39.060
Three orders of ramen.

643
48:39.060 --> 48:39.680
Got it.

644
48:41.940 --> 48:44.050
Think we can make it back to Tokyo tonight?

645
48:44.050 --> 48:46.180
Well, I think we'll be cutting it close.

646
48:46.180 --> 48:47.400
Let me take a look.

647
48:47.400 --> 48:48.280
'K, thanks.

648
48:48.280 --> 48:50.790
Wait, Taki, you sure about that?

649
48:52.740 --> 48:57.440
Yeah. I kinda feel like maybe I've been
barking up the wrong tree this whole time.

650
49:01.770 --> 49:04.800
Hey. That's a sketch of Itomori, isn't it?

651
49:06.760 --> 49:07.910
It's drawn really well.

652
49:08.210 --> 49:10.200
Come take a look at this, Hun!

653
49:11.550 --> 49:13.280
Yeah, that's Itomori.

654
49:13.480 --> 49:14.970
It takes me back.

655
49:14.970 --> 49:17.330
My husband was born and raised there, you know.

656
49:17.580 --> 49:18.840
Itomori?

657
49:20.880 --> 49:23.440
Yes, of course! That's the place!

658
49:23.440 --> 49:25.830
It's nearby, right?

659
49:25.830 --> 49:27.150
You don't...

660
49:27.150 --> 49:28.570
Itomori was...

661
49:28.570 --> 49:30.340
Itomori?

662
49:30.960 --> 49:32.160
Wait!

663
49:31.430 --> 49:32.260
But that's where--

664
49:32.260 --> 49:34.170
Isn't that the area where that comet--?

665
50:23.640 --> 50:27.040
Hey, is this place really where she's from?

666
50:27.040 --> 50:31.220
No way. Taki must've just
confused this with somewhere else.

667
50:31.220 --> 50:32.180
No, I didn't.

668
50:33.200 --> 50:34.580
This was the place.

669
50:35.030 --> 50:37.380
This schoolyard. These mountains.

670
50:37.690 --> 50:40.470
Even this high school here! I remember it all!

671
50:40.470 --> 50:42.410
There's no way you could.

672
50:42.650 --> 50:45.800
You've gotta know about that
disaster three years ago, right?

673
50:46.300 --> 50:48.300
Hundreds of people died.

674
50:48.560 --> 50:49.910
They died?

675
50:50.910 --> 50:52.320
Three years ago?

676
50:53.080 --> 50:54.400
It can't be.

677
50:56.190 --> 50:57.240
There's no way.

678
50:57.720 --> 50:59.010
I mean,

679
50:59.440 --> 51:02.240
I still have the memos she wrote.

680
51:19.260 --> 51:20.560
They're fading...

681
51:30.210 --> 51:35.000
Comet Tia-mat, with an orbital period of 1,200 years,

682
51:35.240 --> 51:38.670
made a close approach to Earth three years ago in October.

683
51:39.300 --> 51:42.780
Nobody foresaw that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

684
51:49.670 --> 51:53.290
The fragment that broke off of it
became a meteor and struck Japan.

685
51:55.460 --> 51:58.800
It looks like that day was the
same date as the autumn festival.

686
51:59.570 --> 52:01.550
The point of impact was here.

687
52:02.620 --> 52:07.310
At 8:42 p.m. it fell right around where
people were gathered for the festival.

688
52:12.000 --> 52:13.820
Over 500 died.

689
52:14.230 --> 52:16.260
It was a third of the town's population,

690
52:16.300 --> 52:19.320
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

691
52:28.020 --> 52:29.330
Teshigawara...

692
52:29.860 --> 52:31.330
and Sayaka.

693
52:35.810 --> 52:37.340
Huh? That's her?

694
52:37.630 --> 52:39.680
You were wrong. You gotta be.

695
52:39.680 --> 52:42.710
After all, this girl here died three years ago!

696
52:42.710 --> 52:45.540
Just two or three weeks ago

697
52:45.540 --> 52:48.590
she said that I'd be able to see the comet.

698
52:48.590 --> 52:50.050
That means--!

699
52:50.050 --> 52:52.210
You're dreaming right now.

700
52:52.520 --> 52:53.310
I...

701
52:53.310 --> 52:54.520
aren't you?

702
52:55.920 --> 52:56.940
I...

703
52:59.250 --> 53:01.320
What... was I?

704
53:15.040 --> 53:16.820
Sounds lively over there.

705
53:16.820 --> 53:19.480
They only have one room left. I'm really sorry.

706
53:19.480 --> 53:20.880
It's not a problem.

707
53:22.070 --> 53:23.120
How's Taki?

708
53:23.120 --> 53:25.640
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

709
53:25.640 --> 53:29.890
He's going through all those newspapers
and magazines at random. Seems obsessive.

710
53:35.260 --> 53:36.320
What is it?

711
53:36.320 --> 53:38.310
Oh, sorry. You smoke, huh?

712
53:38.480 --> 53:41.740
Yeah. I did quit at one point.

713
53:42.670 --> 53:45.330
What do you think about what Taki's been saying?

714
53:49.060 --> 53:50.820
I had feelings for him, you know.

715
53:51.290 --> 53:53.050
The way he's been recently.

716
53:53.520 --> 53:55.610
I mean, he was a nice guy before,

717
53:55.610 --> 53:57.460
but he's even nicer now.

718
53:58.090 --> 54:01.630
Kind of... frantic. It was cute.

719
54:02.480 --> 54:06.610
Although I do think what he's been
telling us is definitely strange sounding.

720
54:09.140 --> 54:12.000
But in the end, the fact remains that Taki's met someone,

721
54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
and that someone is the reason he changed.

722
54:16.050 --> 54:19.050
That much is for sure.

723
54:32.790 --> 54:34.950
It was all just a dream.

724
54:36.590 --> 54:38.110
I recognized the landscape

725
54:38.110 --> 54:41.450
because I unconsciously remembered the news from three years ago.

726
54:43.610 --> 54:47.060
If it's not that, is she... a ghost?

727
54:47.060 --> 54:48.080
Or...

728
54:48.710 --> 54:51.750
did I just make it up? The whole thing.

729
54:55.710 --> 54:57.130
What was her name?

730
54:58.210 --> 54:59.430
I can't remember.

731
55:02.180 --> 55:04.480
Tsukasa said he was gonna go ahead and take a bath.

732
55:04.480 --> 55:05.810
Miss Okudera.

733
55:06.310 --> 55:08.210
Uh... I, um--

734
55:08.860 --> 55:11.650
I realize I've been saying a lot of strange things.

735
55:12.380 --> 55:14.490
I'm really sorry, and thank you.

736
55:23.080 --> 55:25.790
Braided cords. Pretty.

737
55:26.500 --> 55:27.960
That band on your wrist,

738
55:28.090 --> 55:29.800
that's one, isn't it?

739
55:30.530 --> 55:33.070
Oh, this thing? Guess so.

740
55:33.070 --> 55:36.020
Somebody... Someone gave it to me.

741
55:36.600 --> 55:39.800
I wear it sometimes as kind of a lucky charm.

742
55:42.300 --> 55:44.010
Who was it?

743
55:46.080 --> 55:49.300
It's late. Why don't you go down and take a bath too?

744
55:49.300 --> 55:51.050
Sure. Wait.

745
55:54.020 --> 55:56.770
Yeah, someone who makes these.

746
55:56.770 --> 55:58.850
They once told me something.

747
55:58.850 --> 56:01.970
The cords represent the flow of time.

748
56:01.970 --> 56:05.040
They twist and tangle, unravel and connect.

749
56:05.580 --> 56:07.860
And how that's what time is.

750
56:10.200 --> 56:11.550
Maybe if I could--

751
56:37.630 --> 56:39.080
Taki.

752
56:39.480 --> 56:40.950
Taki.

753
56:41.400 --> 56:43.140
Taki!

754
56:44.320 --> 56:46.490
Don't you remember?

755
57:08.840 --> 57:09.930
Taki...

756
57:34.250 --> 57:36.390
Eat this bento up there.

757
57:37.630 --> 57:39.390
Your drawing of Itomori,

758
57:40.280 --> 57:41.390
you did a real good job.

759
58:18.790 --> 58:21.430
They assemble and take shape.

760
58:21.760 --> 58:23.690
They twist, tangle,

761
58:23.690 --> 58:27.440
unravel now and then, break and reconnect.

762
58:28.370 --> 58:30.440
That's what a union is.

763
58:31.010 --> 58:32.940
What time is.

764
58:43.230 --> 58:44.340
There it is!

765
58:46.370 --> 58:48.040
It's really there.

766
58:49.710 --> 58:52.000
It wasn't a dream.

767
59:22.900 --> 59:25.910
What lies ahead... is the netherworld.

768
59:49.040 --> 59:51.650
It's still here.

769
59:53.040 --> 59:54.540
This was Yotsuha's,

770
59:55.040 --> 59:56.320
and this was mine.

771
0:59:59.330 --> 1:00:01.080
This was before the comet.

772
1:00:01.540 --> 1:00:03.760
So when I switched places with her,

773
1:00:03.950 --> 1:00:05.950
it was also three years in the past.

774
1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:10.960
Our times got tangled somehow.

775
1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:14.540
This is half of her.

776
1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.530
Musubi.

777
1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:34.890
If it's true, and time can be unraveled,

778
1:00:35.690 --> 1:00:37.580
just give me one chance.

779
1:00:52.530 --> 1:00:53.790
A comet!

780
1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:01.880
Your name's going to be Mitsuha.

781
1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:11.130
Both of you are my treasures.

782
1:02:11.130 --> 1:02:13.350
You're going to be a big sister.

783
1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:18.420
I'm so sorry, me dears.

784
1:02:20.070 --> 1:02:23.640
Dad, when is Mommy coming home?

785
1:02:24.710 --> 1:02:26.040
I couldn't help her.

786
1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.080
Get a hold of yourself!

787
1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:29.660
Who cares about the shrine?!

788
1:02:29.660 --> 1:02:31.220
But you're in charge now!

789
1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:33.660
I loved Futaba! Not Miyamizu Shrine.

790
1:02:33.690 --> 1:02:35.070
Get out!

791
1:02:38.290 --> 1:02:41.620
Now listen to me, girls, starting today,

792
1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:44.220
you'll be living with Grandma.

793
1:02:48.580 --> 1:02:50.320
Who am I?

794
1:02:50.410 --> 1:02:51.720
Who are you?

795
1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:53.250
Don't be full of yourself!

796
1:02:53.250 --> 1:02:55.270
Like you have a girlfriend.

797
1:02:55.270 --> 1:02:56.380
Must be nice.

798
1:02:56.680 --> 1:02:59.210
They've probably met up about now.

799
1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:01.500
Why am I...?

800
1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:02.880
I'm going to Tokyo.

801
1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:04.690
What? Wait, Sis!

802
1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:08.160
Grandma.

803
1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:10.740
would you mind doing me a favor?

804
1:03:11.810 --> 1:03:14.180
Oh, yeah, the comet.

805
1:03:14.790 --> 1:03:17.810
It'll be at its brightest today, right?

806
1:03:17.810 --> 1:03:20.020
Mitsuha! Don't go there!

807
1:03:20.990 --> 1:03:25.260
Mitsuha, You've gotta get out of
town before the comet strikes!

808
1:03:27.950 --> 1:03:29.710
Mitsuha, run!

809
1:03:30.690 --> 1:03:33.380
Mitsuha. Mitsuha!

810
1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:35.410
Mitsuha!

811
1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:56.350
Mitsuha. She's alive.

812
1:04:07.550 --> 1:04:09.470
Let me guess, you're touching your boo--

813
1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:13.160
Her sister!

814
1:04:16.100 --> 1:04:18.420
Yotsuha!

815
1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:23.970
I think she's finally lost it.

816
1:04:23.970 --> 1:04:27.250
Just for today, I'm gonna head out first.

817
1:04:27.250 --> 1:04:28.610
She's lost it.

818
1:04:28.610 --> 1:04:32.530
Really lost it. Totally, totally lost it.

819
1:04:32.570 --> 1:04:38.060
For all you star-gazers out there, the comet Tia-mat
has been visible to the naked eye for about a week now.

820
1:04:38.060 --> 1:04:41.950
Tonight it will finally reach its perigee around 7:40 p.m.

821
1:04:41.950 --> 1:04:44.395
and be at its maximum brightness
when viewed from the Earth's surface.

822
1:04:44.420 --> 1:04:47.220
It's tonight. There's still time left.

823
1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:49.570
Morning, Mitsuha.

824
1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:51.310
What's this?

825
1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:55.890
Hold on. You're not Mitsuha, are you?

826
1:04:55.930 --> 1:04:57.700
Wait, how did you...?

827
1:04:57.970 --> 1:04:59.690
You already knew?

828
1:04:59.950 --> 1:05:05.850
No, but watching the way you've been
behaving lately stirred some memories up.

829
1:05:07.350 --> 1:05:09.210
When I was a young girl,

830
1:05:09.910 --> 1:05:12.740
I had some pretty strange dreams myself.

831
1:05:13.870 --> 1:05:15.000
Though it's been so long,

832
1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.860
the memories of who I became in those
dreams have pretty much faded at this point.

833
1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:21.590
Faded.

834
1:05:21.590 --> 1:05:23.520
Treasure the experience.

835
1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:26.260
Dreams eventually will fade away.

836
1:05:27.190 --> 1:05:29.720
I went through similar times myself,

837
1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:31.740
and so did your mother.

838
1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:36.450
What if... all those dreams that the Miyamizu people had...

839
1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:38.560
...it had to do with today?

840
1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:42.060
Grandma, you have to listen to me!

841
1:05:42.750 --> 1:05:46.570
Tonight, the comet is going to fall on Itomori.

842
1:05:46.690 --> 1:05:48.160
You're all gonna die!

843
1:05:55.310 --> 1:05:56.560
"Nobody's gonna believe that"?

844
1:05:56.560 --> 1:05:59.760
I didn't expect that out of Mitsuha's grandma.

845
1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:01.080
It doesn't matter!

846
1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:03.770
There's no way I'm gonna let them all die!

847
1:06:04.510 --> 1:06:07.730
Mitshua! What happened to--?

848
1:06:08.880 --> 1:06:11.700
What'd you--? You're hair!

849
1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:14.160
Ah, the haircut? Looked better before, huh?

850
1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:15.940
No! I-It's good!

851
1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:19.930
Never mind that! If we don't do
something about tonight, we'll all die!

852
1:06:19.930 --> 1:06:20.930
What?

853
1:06:22.250 --> 1:06:24.340
It's up to us to save everyone!

854
1:06:29.210 --> 1:06:31.120
Wait! Shouldn't you be in school?

855
1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:35.840
Well, we sort of have to save the town, or something.

856
1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:38.750
The warning system?

857
1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:41.390
Yeah, those speakers all over town.

858
1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:48.330
I get it. It could work!

859
1:06:48.330 --> 1:06:50.020
Nice job, Teshi!

860
1:06:50.020 --> 1:06:52.500
Hey, I don't think you should be sitting so close to me.

861
1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.890
What's wrong? Uh-oh! You shy?

862
1:06:54.890 --> 1:06:57.860
Would ya quit it? It ain't proper! And you know it!

863
1:06:59.930 --> 1:07:03.010
Such a gentleman!

864
1:07:05.810 --> 1:07:08.550
I bought all the snacks, guys! Here's the change.

865
1:07:08.550 --> 1:07:09.900
Sorry for the trouble.

866
1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:11.480
I didn't mind.

867
1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:13.920
We ought be getting paid.

868
1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:13.920
Quit complaining.

869
1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.520
So? What'd ya come up with?

870
1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:19.600
Got an evacuation plan?

871
1:07:23.050 --> 1:07:25.770
A... A-- A bomb?!

872
1:07:25.770 --> 1:07:30.270
Yeah, we have water gel explosives we
use for construction at our storage site.

873
1:07:30.270 --> 1:07:31.770
And the warning system?

874
1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:37.040
A start up frequency can hijack the
town's warning system pretty easily.

875
1:07:37.040 --> 1:07:40.700
So we can broadcast an evacuation warning
for the whole town right from school!

876
1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:43.730
Look, we're outside the disaster area here,

877
1:07:43.730 --> 1:07:46.170
so we'll just make an announcement
to evacuate to the school.

878
1:07:46.560 --> 1:07:49.250
It's-- It's totally a crime.

879
1:07:49.250 --> 1:07:50.940
You'll be in charge of the broadcast, Saya.

880
1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:51.840
Why me?!

881
1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:53.680
You're in the broadcast club.

882
1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:55.310
And I'll be in charge of the explosives.

883
1:07:55.310 --> 1:07:57.010
While I go have a word with the mayor.

884
1:07:57.010 --> 1:07:57.590
Why?

885
1:07:57.590 --> 1:08:02.170
'Cause if the evacuation order's not coming
from town hall, then nobody's gonna go anywhere.

886
1:08:02.170 --> 1:08:05.170
But if I talk to the mayor, as his daughter, I can convince him.

887
1:08:05.170 --> 1:08:06.720
It's the perfect plan.

888
1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:11.200
Fine, I don't really care one way or the other.

889
1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.230
This is just a theory of yours, right?

890
1:08:13.230 --> 1:08:15.660
Uh. Well...

891
1:08:15.660 --> 1:08:17.480
Theories can be based on reality!

892
1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:19.740
Like, do you know the story of how Itomori Lake was formed?

893
1:08:20.170 --> 1:08:21.330
It's a crater!

894
1:08:21.330 --> 1:08:25.790
That means a meteor hit this area
at least once a thousand years ago!

895
1:08:25.790 --> 1:08:27.520
Right! That's why--

896
1:08:27.870 --> 1:08:29.550
Nice one, Teshi!

897
1:08:33.470 --> 1:08:35.490
Let's go evacuate the town!

898
1:08:39.510 --> 1:08:42.010
What on earth are you talking about?

899
1:08:43.530 --> 1:08:47.240
Like I said, we have to evacuate
everyone in town before tonight

900
1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:49.020
or else...

901
1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:49.020
Enough. Shut up!

902
1:08:54.770 --> 1:08:58.020
The comet is going to split in two and strike the town?

903
1:08:58.370 --> 1:09:00.560
Over five hundred will die?

904
1:09:01.450 --> 1:09:04.050
How dare you stand there and spout such nonsense!

905
1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.520
If you're serious, you must be sick.

906
1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.040
I guess recklessness is a Miyamizu trait.

907
1:09:12.630 --> 1:09:17.050
I'll have a car take you to the
city hospital for an examination.

908
1:09:17.050 --> 1:09:20.870
We will continue this discussion after you've seen a doctor.

909
1:09:21.750 --> 1:09:22.610
You!

910
1:09:24.300 --> 1:09:25.640
You son of a--

911
1:09:34.260 --> 1:09:35.340
Mitsuha?

912
1:09:36.870 --> 1:09:37.660
No...

913
1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:40.010
Wait a minute...

914
1:09:41.620 --> 1:09:42.500
Who are you?

915
1:09:57.290 --> 1:09:59.210
I'll see you guys at the festival.

916
1:09:59.210 --> 1:10:01.740
We'll meet you at the steps to the shrine!
Don't be late, okay?

917
1:10:01.740 --> 1:10:03.180
Bye-bye!

918
1:10:02.530 --> 1:10:03.360
See ya.

919
1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:04.170
Later.

920
1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:07.180
You shouldn't go!

921
1:10:07.580 --> 1:10:10.180
You've gotta leave town! Tell all of your friends!

922
1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:11.620
What's wrong with ya?

923
1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:13.120
Mitsuha!

924
1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:13.810
What was that about?

925
1:10:13.610 --> 1:10:15.210
Come on. Let's go.

926
1:10:15.210 --> 1:10:17.270
What're you doing, huh?

927
1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.230
If it was Mitsuha,

928
1:10:19.790 --> 1:10:22.270
would she have been able to convince him?

929
1:10:22.270 --> 1:10:23.660
Is all this my fault?

930
1:10:23.930 --> 1:10:27.880
Yotsuha! Promise me that you'll
leave town with Grandma before dark!

931
1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:28.410
What?

932
1:10:28.410 --> 1:10:30.190
You're gonna die if you stay here!

933
1:10:30.190 --> 1:10:31.500
What're you talking about?

934
1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:33.880
And why'd you suddenly go to Tokyo yesterday?

935
1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:36.770
You've been acting really strange lately!

936
1:10:38.190 --> 1:10:39.530
Went to Tokyo?

937
1:10:39.700 --> 1:10:42.340
Hey, Mitsuha!

938
1:10:44.630 --> 1:10:46.080
How'd it go with your old man?

939
1:10:48.730 --> 1:10:50.430
Hey! Mitsuha!

940
1:10:51.210 --> 1:10:52.620
What's with your sister?

941
1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:53.680
Dunno.

942
1:11:03.940 --> 1:11:05.550
Could she be over there?

943
1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:09.110
What's that? What's over there?

944
1:11:09.110 --> 1:11:10.690
Let me use your bike, Teshi.

945
1:11:10.690 --> 1:11:12.940
Hey! Mitsuha!

946
1:11:13.850 --> 1:11:15.710
And what do we do?

947
1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:17.710
Get things ready like we planned!

948
1:11:18.020 --> 1:11:19.320
I'm counting on you!

949
1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:48.240
Oh my gosh! I'm Taki again.

950
1:11:51.370 --> 1:11:53.840
But what was Taki doing out here?

951
1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:04.380
The town...

952
1:12:05.420 --> 1:12:07.100
It's gone.

953
1:12:16.300 --> 1:12:19.730
So does that mean...

954
1:12:21.450 --> 1:12:24.330
...they died?

955
1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:35.750
Taki.

956
1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:37.290
Taki!

957
1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:41.790
Don't you remember?

958
1:12:54.140 --> 1:12:56.420
I'm going to Tokyo for a few hours.

959
1:12:56.420 --> 1:12:57.810
What? Right now?

960
1:12:57.810 --> 1:12:58.910
But why?

961
1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:00.400
For a date.

962
1:13:00.810 --> 1:13:03.170
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

963
1:13:03.170 --> 1:13:05.140
I didn't say it was a date for me.

964
1:13:06.310 --> 1:13:08.220
I'll be back tonight.

965
1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:12.810
If I suddenly show up,

966
1:13:12.810 --> 1:13:16.350
will it be a nuisance? Or a surprise?

967
1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.370
He might not like it if I do.

968
1:13:26.850 --> 1:13:30.900
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

969
1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:32.820
I guess it won't happen.

970
1:13:33.470 --> 1:13:35.760
But what if it did?

971
1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:39.680
What would I do? Would I annoy him?

972
1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:42.120
Would it be awkward?

973
1:13:42.450 --> 1:13:46.650
Or maybe... he'd be glad to see me.

974
1:13:47.980 --> 1:13:52.340
The number you are trying to reach is
currently outside the cellular network.

975
1:13:52.930 --> 1:13:55.100
I guess we won't meet.

976
1:13:56.430 --> 1:13:57.320
But...

977
1:13:58.540 --> 1:14:01.140
...there's one thing I'm certain of.

978
1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:03.730
If we see each other,

979
1:14:03.730 --> 1:14:06.650
we'll definitely know right away.

980
1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:10.750
That you were the one who was in me.

981
1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:15.340
And that I was the one that was in you.

982
1:14:15.130 --> 1:14:15.860
Sorry.

983
1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:23.220
The train will be arriving momentarily.
Please stand behind the line.

984
1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:27.040
When entering the train, please mind the gap.

985
1:14:47.630 --> 1:14:48.810
Excuse me.

986
1:14:48.810 --> 1:14:51.230
The doors are now closing.

987
1:15:21.295 --> 1:15:25.415
That time three years ago, before I even knew you...

988
1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:28.670
Yotsuya. The platform will be on the right.

989
1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:30.330
Taki.

990
1:15:31.630 --> 1:15:32.770
Taki.

991
1:15:34.790 --> 1:15:35.910
Taki.

992
1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:39.020
Um, it's me!

993
1:15:41.530 --> 1:15:44.050
Don't you remember?

994
1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:46.470
Sorry, who are you?

995
1:15:50.970 --> 1:15:52.740
I-I'm sorry.

996
1:16:00.450 --> 1:16:01.990
But he's Taki.

997
1:16:03.090 --> 1:16:04.990
What a weird girl.

998
1:16:04.990 --> 1:16:09.000
Yotsuya. Yotsuya. Stand clear of the doors.

999
1:16:13.750 --> 1:16:14.500
Hold on!

1000
1:16:15.370 --> 1:16:17.020
But what's your name?

1001
1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:19.130
Mitsuha!

1002
1:16:19.510 --> 1:16:22.260
My name is... Mitsuha!

1003
1:16:28.770 --> 1:16:31.940
Three years ago, you showed up.

1004
1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:36.220
It was... to see me!

1005
1:16:47.510 --> 1:16:48.660
Taki?

1006
1:16:57.200 --> 1:16:59.170
Mitsuha!

1007
1:17:00.210 --> 1:17:00.970
Taki!?

1008
1:17:15.710 --> 1:17:18.020
Mitsuha!

1009
1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:22.310
You're here, right? Inside my body!

1010
1:17:22.310 --> 1:17:23.470
Taki!

1011
1:17:24.300 --> 1:17:26.530
Taki, where are you?

1012
1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:28.000
That was Mitsuha.

1013
1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.640
I can hear her voice, but...

1014
1:17:31.570 --> 1:17:34.970
Taki, where are you?

1015
1:17:34.970 --> 1:17:36.000
Taki!

1016
1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:51.480
Taki, are you...?

1017
1:17:52.540 --> 1:17:54.110
Are you there?

1018
1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:20.830
Magic hour.

1019
1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:20.830
Magic hour.

1020
1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:36.900
Mitsuha.

1021
1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:44.480
Taki.

1022
1:18:45.850 --> 1:18:47.040
Taki!

1023
1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:49.410
You're really here.

1024
1:18:53.470 --> 1:18:54.630
Taki!

1025
1:18:54.630 --> 1:18:56.630
I came all this way to see you.

1026
1:18:57.130 --> 1:18:58.560
Which wasn't easy,

1027
1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:01.200
since you were pretty far away.

1028
1:19:02.110 --> 1:19:04.340
Huh? How is that even--?

1029
1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:06.190
Because back then...

1030
1:19:06.190 --> 1:19:08.730
Well, I drank some of your <i>kuchikamizake</i>.

1031
1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:14.680
You-- You drank that?

1032
1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:17.280
Stupid pervert!

1033
1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:18.210
Wh-What?

1034
1:19:18.210 --> 1:19:19.230
Yeah! That's right!

1035
1:19:19.230 --> 1:19:21.520
You were touching my boobies, weren't you?

1036
1:19:21.970 --> 1:19:23.490
Wh--?! H-How do you even...?

1037
1:19:23.490 --> 1:19:24.840
'Cause Yotsuha saw you!

1038
1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:28.890
I-I just... I couldn't help myself!
But it was just the one time.

1039
1:19:28.890 --> 1:19:30.540
Just the one time?

1040
1:19:32.030 --> 1:19:34.600
How many times isn't the issue!

1041
1:19:35.210 --> 1:19:36.170
Sorry.

1042
1:19:36.520 --> 1:19:38.800
Wait, is that--?

1043
1:19:39.210 --> 1:19:43.070
Oh, yeah, it's yours, but you visited before I knew you.

1044
1:19:43.770 --> 1:19:45.800
So I didn't know who you were.

1045
1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:46.980
Here.

1046
1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:49.480
I kept it for three years.

1047
1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.970
But I think it's time you got it back.

1048
1:20:02.770 --> 1:20:03.740
What do ya think?

1049
1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:06.610
Oh, uh, well... It's not bad.

1050
1:20:06.610 --> 1:20:08.030
Oh, you're lying!

1051
1:20:09.650 --> 1:20:10.660
Busted.

1052
1:20:10.660 --> 1:20:12.830
Why you gotta be like that?

1053
1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:31.610
Hey, Mitsuha, you still have a lot to do. Listen.

1054
1:20:32.630 --> 1:20:33.650
It's coming.

1055
1:20:34.210 --> 1:20:36.730
Don't worry. You still have enough time.

1056
1:20:36.730 --> 1:20:38.760
I'll do my best.

1057
1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:43.100
It looks like magic hour's almost...

1058
1:20:43.410 --> 1:20:44.200
...over.

1059
1:20:46.590 --> 1:20:47.690
Hey, Mitsuha.

1060
1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:50.610
Just so we don't forget things when we wake up.

1061
1:20:55.190 --> 1:20:56.690
Let's write down our names.

1062
1:20:57.710 --> 1:20:58.520
Here.

1063
1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:11.980
Mitsuha?

1064
1:21:14.330 --> 1:21:16.700
Hey, Mitsuha?

1065
1:21:25.100 --> 1:21:27.130
I was planning to tell you...

1066
1:21:28.670 --> 1:21:30.590
...that wherever you are in the world,

1067
1:21:30.750 --> 1:21:33.670
I swear that I'll find you again, no matter what.

1068
1:21:37.150 --> 1:21:39.640
Your name... is Mitsuha.

1069
1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:43.370
It'll be okay. I'll remember.

1070
1:21:43.660 --> 1:21:47.640
Mitsuha, Mitsuha, Mitsuha! Your name's Mitsuha!

1071
1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:49.300
Your name is...

1072
1:21:59.980 --> 1:22:01.050
Who

1073
1:22:01.860 --> 1:22:03.020
are you?

1074
1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.960
And what did I even come here for?

1075
1:22:08.730 --> 1:22:12.130
I came... I came all this way to see her!

1076
1:22:12.130 --> 1:22:13.990
I came to save her.

1077
1:22:13.990 --> 1:22:15.720
I wanted her to be alive.

1078
1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:17.530
Who was it again?

1079
1:22:17.530 --> 1:22:18.530
Who?

1080
1:22:18.530 --> 1:22:19.980
Who did I come to see?

1081
1:22:20.350 --> 1:22:21.870
Someone precious.

1082
1:22:21.870 --> 1:22:24.080
Someone that I don't wanna forget.

1083
1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:26.080
Someone I shouldn't!

1084
1:22:26.670 --> 1:22:27.540
Who was it?

1085
1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:29.280
Who was it?

1086
1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.600
Who? Who?

1087
1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:33.300
What's your name?!

1088
1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:51.880
Taki. Taki. Taki!

1089
1:22:51.870 --> 1:22:56.100
It'll be fine. I'll remember. I'll never forget!

1090
1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:58.560
Taki. Taki!

1091
1:22:58.570 --> 1:23:01.750
Your name is Taki!

1092
1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:17.370
Teshi!

1093
1:23:17.660 --> 1:23:18.430
Mitsuha!

1094
1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:20.480
Where the heck have you been?

1095
1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:22.720
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

1096
1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.420
Wha--? Who did?

1097
1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:25.460
I did!

1098
1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:28.720
You're gonna have to explain it to me later.

1099
1:23:33.290 --> 1:23:36.060
That thing is going to fall, right? For real?

1100
1:23:36.060 --> 1:23:38.240
For real. I saw it with my own eyes!

1101
1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:41.050
What? You did, huh?

1102
1:23:41.050 --> 1:23:43.170
Well, I guess it's settled then.

1103
1:23:43.830 --> 1:23:46.250
We're both officially criminals.

1104
1:23:47.930 --> 1:23:50.960
What? Do I really have to?

1105
1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.850
Once the town's power goes out,

1106
1:23:52.850 --> 1:23:55.410
the emergency generators will kick on right away.

1107
1:23:55.410 --> 1:23:57.360
Use the broadcast equipment once it does.

1108
1:23:57.680 --> 1:23:58.860
Don't be scared, Saya.

1109
1:23:58.860 --> 1:24:00.930
And repeat it as many times as you can.

1110
1:24:02.050 --> 1:24:03.510
You can do it!

1111
1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:06.690
Aw, nuts. It's do or die!

1112
1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:14.500
Shouldn't it be going off?

1113
1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:16.170
Hell if I know!

1114
1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:27.420
What was that?

1115
1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:29.670
That was pretty loud too. Look over there!

1116
1:24:55.210 --> 1:24:56.800
Hey, look! Up there!

1117
1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:09.450
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1118
1:25:09.570 --> 1:25:14.830
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1119
1:25:11.810 --> 1:25:13.050
Explosion?

1120
1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:15.050
Did I just hear that right?

1121
1:25:15.060 --> 1:25:18.840
Wildfires are possible, as well as the threat of more explosions.

1122
1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.640
Residents in he following areas,

1123
1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:25.410
please evacuate to Itomori High School immediately.

1124
1:25:26.170 --> 1:25:27.950
Kadoiri District

1125
1:25:28.350 --> 1:25:30.050
Sakagami District...

1126
1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:31.170
Honey, we should go.

1127
1:25:31.170 --> 1:25:32.980
The broadcast isn't coming from us?

1128
1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:34.350
Well, who the hell is it then?

1129
1:25:34.370 --> 1:25:36.350
Miyamori District.

1130
1:25:37.090 --> 1:25:39.080
Oyazawa District.

1131
1:25:39.850 --> 1:25:41.350
Let's go, Mitsuha!

1132
1:25:43.380 --> 1:25:44.440
Teshi!

1133
1:25:50.870 --> 1:25:53.520
Everyone, run! There's a wildfire!

1134
1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:56.081
Wildfire! Please run!

1135
1:25:56.480 --> 1:25:59.160
Get outta here! Run!

1136
1:25:57.670 --> 1:26:00.880
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

1137
1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:05.210
It's not working. We're running outta time! Mitsuha!

1138
1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:07.210
What's wrong?

1139
1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:09.840
What is it?

1140
1:26:10.370 --> 1:26:12.210
I can't remember what his name is anymore!

1141
1:26:15.010 --> 1:26:16.480
What is with you?!

1142
1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:18.270
You're the one who started all of this!

1143
1:26:19.150 --> 1:26:22.240
We can't evacuate everyone without firefighters!

1144
1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.890
Get going! You gotta convince your old man!

1145
1:26:26.850 --> 1:26:29.060
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1146
1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.520
Reports of an explosion at the substation are coming in.

1147
1:26:33.090 --> 1:26:36.160
Everybody! Get to the high school! Hurry!

1148
1:26:38.950 --> 1:26:40.610
Oh, it's Mitsuha.

1149
1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:46.070
Why would terrorists attack way out here?

1150
1:26:46.070 --> 1:26:47.610
What is Chubu Electric saying?

1151
1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:48.260
They're still checking.

1152
1:26:48.530 --> 1:26:50.850
Any update? No wildfires yet?

1153
1:26:50.850 --> 1:26:52.750
You're sure? Got it.

1154
1:26:54.610 --> 1:26:56.650
Make them stop this broadcast immediately!

1155
1:26:56.650 --> 1:26:58.480
Haven't you located its source yet?!

1156
1:26:58.490 --> 1:27:01.270
Mayor! The Takayama sensor station just called!

1157
1:27:02.170 --> 1:27:03.790
From the high school?

1158
1:27:04.050 --> 1:27:07.290
Once again, residents in the following areas,

1159
1:27:07.290 --> 1:27:10.170
please evacuate to Itomori High-- Ah!

1160
1:27:10.170 --> 1:27:12.980
What're you doing? Turn that off!

1161
1:27:14.910 --> 1:27:16.180
They got Saya!

1162
1:27:16.180 --> 1:27:17.450
Oh, no!

1163
1:27:20.810 --> 1:27:23.460
What were you doing, Natori? I swear.

1164
1:27:26.800 --> 1:27:29.740
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1165
1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:34.290
We are currently confirming the reports of the accident.

1166
1:27:35.036 --> 1:27:40.710
We instruct all residents to remain calm
and stay where they are till further notice.

1167
1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:41.400
I guess we have to stay put.

1168
1:27:42.010 --> 1:27:42.910
What is going on?

1169
1:27:42.910 --> 1:27:44.400
So stay on standby.

1170
1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:47.920
Come on, they said everyone should evacuate!

1171
1:27:48.210 --> 1:27:50.420
The high school's the evacuation center!

1172
1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:51.650
Katsuhiko!

1173
1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:57.310
Tell me. What do you think you're doing?

1174
1:28:00.420 --> 1:28:01.860
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1175
1:28:03.310 --> 1:28:04.870
This is the end.

1176
1:28:06.990 --> 1:28:10.870
Oh my god. It's actually splitting apart.

1177
1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:20.780
Look at that! The comet has split into two large parts,

1178
1:28:20.780 --> 1:28:23.340
and meteors are now falling to earth!

1179
1:28:23.910 --> 1:28:26.090
I don't believe anyone could've predicted this.

1180
1:28:26.090 --> 1:28:28.300
Either way, we have quite the mystical view here.

1181
1:28:28.300 --> 1:28:31.880
So what does the comet's nucleus splitting mean for us?

1182
1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:33.460
The comet's not within the Roche limit,

1183
1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:37.360
so the nucleus itself must've had a
structural weakness for this to happen.

1184
1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:42.590
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke apart
and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1185
1:28:42.590 --> 1:28:45.110
There were at least 21 fragments then.

1186
1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:45.920
I'm going outside to take a look.

1187
1:28:45.110 --> 1:28:46.500
The fragments will likely burn up

1188
1:28:46.500 --> 1:28:49.930
well before reaching the ground,
The probability of a meteor actually landing...

1189
1:28:49.930 --> 1:28:54.490
Scientists were already intently examining the
comet, but never foresaw this development.

1190
1:28:54.490 --> 1:28:56.130
To predict the trajectory--

1191
1:28:56.130 --> 1:28:58.270
As we stand here witnessing this spectacle,

1192
1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:01.460
unassisted and with our bare eyes,

1193
1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:05.940
it strikes me that living in such an age
has never felt more fortunate than now.

1194
1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:13.140
Hey. Who are you?

1195
1:29:16.690 --> 1:29:19.220
Who? Who?

1196
1:29:19.770 --> 1:29:21.380
Who is he?

1197
1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:23.710
Someone precious.

1198
1:29:23.710 --> 1:29:25.320
Someone I shouldn't forget.

1199
1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.790
Someone I didn't want to!

1200
1:29:28.460 --> 1:29:32.780
Who? Who? Who are you?

1201
1:29:33.210 --> 1:29:35.000
What's your name?

1202
1:29:40.760 --> 1:29:42.020
Oh, no.

1203
1:30:01.490 --> 1:30:04.000
So that we don't forget things when we wake up,

1204
1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:05.800
let's write down our names.

1205
1:30:14.583 --> 1:30:16.882
"I LOVE YOU"

1206
1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:38.050
Writing this... doesn't help. I won't know your name.

1207
1:30:51.660 --> 1:30:52.810
Dad!

1208
1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:55.340
Mitsuha?

1209
1:30:55.360 --> 1:30:56.570
There you are!

1210
1:30:56.720 --> 1:30:58.360
Don't tell me you're back.

1211
1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:05.690
It was almost like seeing something out of a dream.

1212
1:31:06.470 --> 1:31:10.370
Nothing more or less than a breathtaking view.

1213
1:32:43.870 --> 1:32:45.890
Why am I here?

1214
1:32:46.850 --> 1:32:48.210
What am I doing?

1215
1:32:57.970 --> 1:33:01.290
Next is Yoyogi. Yoyogi.

1216
1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:17.960
The doors are closing. Please be careful.

1217
1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:22.730
I'm always searching for something.

1218
1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:28.070
This feeling has consumed me for some time.

1219
1:33:30.030 --> 1:33:32.120
The reason I applied for this position...

1220
1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:33.620
The landscapes people live in...

1221
1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:35.630
To build a city's landscape...

1222
1:33:35.630 --> 1:33:38.630
Even Tokyo, it might vanish too one day.

1223
1:33:38.630 --> 1:33:41.390
And so, I wanna make landscapes that

1224
1:33:41.390 --> 1:33:42.900
How should I put this?

1225
1:33:42.900 --> 1:33:46.440
That can continue to warm people's hearts.

1226
1:33:48.140 --> 1:33:50.450
That bad? How many does that make it?

1227
1:33:50.470 --> 1:33:51.880
I've stopped counting.

1228
1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:53.380
Doesn't sound too promising.

1229
1:33:53.380 --> 1:33:54.160
Who asked you?

1230
1:33:54.160 --> 1:33:55.960
That suit could be the problem.

1231
1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:57.660
It looks just like yours!

1232
1:33:57.660 --> 1:33:59.910
Well, I have two offers.

1233
1:33:59.060 --> 1:33:59.910
I have eight myself.

1234
1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:10.660
Is what I'm searching for... someone? Or somewhere?

1235
1:34:11.730 --> 1:34:14.430
Or am I just searching for the right job?

1236
1:34:14.430 --> 1:34:16.670
I don't even really know.

1237
1:34:17.980 --> 1:34:20.370
Oh, You're job hunting, huh?

1238
1:34:20.370 --> 1:34:22.310
I haven't had much luck though.

1239
1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:25.150
Hey, maybe it's the suit that's killing your chances.

1240
1:34:25.150 --> 1:34:27.280
Does it really look that bad on me?

1241
1:34:31.950 --> 1:34:34.420
So why the sudden call today?

1242
1:34:34.420 --> 1:34:36.240
I was in the area for work

1243
1:34:36.240 --> 1:34:39.450
and I figured it had been a while since I saw your face.

1244
1:34:41.870 --> 1:34:45.950
Remember that one time when we went all the way to Itomori?

1245
1:34:45.950 --> 1:34:49.510
You were still in high school back then, so it was...

1246
1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:50.950
Five years ago.

1247
1:34:50.950 --> 1:34:52.270
That long?

1248
1:34:52.830 --> 1:34:55.800
It seems like... I've forgotten a lot.

1249
1:34:56.990 --> 1:34:59.320
I don't remember all that much either,

1250
1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:01.360
about back then.

1251
1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:03.630
Maybe we argued.

1252
1:35:03.940 --> 1:35:06.740
She and Tsukasa went back to Tokyo without me.

1253
1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:11.500
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1254
1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:12.980
That's about all I remember.

1255
1:35:16.060 --> 1:35:18.240
But at one point in time,

1256
1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:22.750
I found myself strangely drawn to
the incident involving that comet.

1257
1:35:25.210 --> 1:35:28.650
A fragment of the comet destroyed a town in that disaster.

1258
1:35:28.990 --> 1:35:33.180
But miraculously, most of the people
living in the town were unhurt.

1259
1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:37.270
The town happened to be holding
an emergency drill that day,

1260
1:35:37.810 --> 1:35:40.760
and most of its residents were outside the impact zone.

1261
1:35:42.410 --> 1:35:46.930
The sheer luck and coincidence of it
all sparked various conspiracy theories.

1262
1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.250
I read a lot of articles about it back then.

1263
1:35:50.250 --> 1:35:52.200
I was kind of obsessed.

1264
1:35:53.310 --> 1:35:56.270
But whatever the reason I had for my interest,

1265
1:35:56.270 --> 1:35:58.140
is a mystery to me now.

1266
1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:02.460
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1267
1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:08.760
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1268
1:36:10.030 --> 1:36:15.610
I do hope that at some point, you'll find happiness too.

1269
1:36:19.090 --> 1:36:21.870
I feel like I'm always searching.

1270
1:36:22.410 --> 1:36:25.420
For something. Someone.

1271
1:36:36.750 --> 1:36:39.910
I feel like I do wanna go to one more bridal fair.

1272
1:36:39.910 --> 1:36:41.410
They're all the same.

1273
1:36:41.470 --> 1:36:43.630
A Shinto wedding sure sounds nice too.

1274
1:36:43.630 --> 1:36:46.150
You said you wanted to be married in a chapel!

1275
1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:48.060
Oh! That reminds me, Teshi.

1276
1:36:48.250 --> 1:36:50.920
Would ya please shave before the ceremony?

1277
1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:52.920
I'm going on a diet for it, ya know?

1278
1:36:53.330 --> 1:36:55.370
She says as she's eating a cake.

1279
1:36:55.430 --> 1:36:57.430
I'll get serious tomorrow.

1280
1:37:56.050 --> 1:37:58.930
The landscape of a town that's no longer there.

1281
1:37:59.450 --> 1:38:03.840
Why does looking at it make my heart feel so tight?

1282
1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:25.360
I was always searching.

1283
1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:26.460
Searching for...

1284
1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:29.350
...someone!

1285
1:40:26.830 --> 1:40:28.130
Excuse me!

1286
1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:29.540
Haven't we--?

1287
1:40:29.970 --> 1:40:32.640
Have I met you somewhere?

1288
1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:43.230
I thought so too!

1289
1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:50.290
Can I ask you... your name?

1290
1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:50.290
Can I ask you... your name?
