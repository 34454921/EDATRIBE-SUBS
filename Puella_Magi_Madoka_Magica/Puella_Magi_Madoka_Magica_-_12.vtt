00:03.430 --> 00:04.370
Homura...

2
00:04.580 --> 00:05.520
I am sorry.

3
00:06.720 --> 00:09.290
But I wanna be a magical girl.

4
00:10.630 --> 00:11.640
Madoka...

5
00:12.070 --> 00:13.060
Don't do it!

6
00:13.560 --> 00:15.810
I finally figured it out what I wanna wish for.

7
00:16.090 --> 00:18.420
I know what I want now more than anything else.

8
00:18.710 --> 00:21.380
And I'm ready to trade my life for it, with no regrets.

9
00:21.430 --> 00:22.430
But you can't!

10
00:22.890 --> 00:25.650
If you do then,
everything I've fought for...

11
00:26.080 --> 00:27.810
...it's all for nothing!

12
00:34.000 --> 00:35.020
I'm sorry.

13
00:35.560 --> 00:36.900
I'm so sorry.

14
00:37.160 --> 00:39.920
You've been protecting me for a long time,

15
00:40.240 --> 00:41.530
and I'll never forget that.

16
00:42.010 --> 00:45.400
I know you're the reason
that I'm the person I am today.

17
00:46.340 --> 00:47.620
I'm so sorry.

18
00:51.550 --> 00:52.920
I really want this.

19
00:53.120 --> 00:55.100
It's the answer I've been looking for,

20
00:55.300 --> 00:56.430
I swear.

21
00:57.300 --> 01:00.590
I promise I won't ever let your efforts be in vain.

22
01:00.780 --> 01:01.720
Believe me, Homura.

23
01:01.950 --> 01:02.810
Madoka...

24
01:07.780 --> 01:11.300
You are the center of karmic destiny
from many different timelines,

25
01:11.440 --> 01:13.360
so no matter how enormous your wish,

26
01:13.560 --> 01:15.720
it most definitely will come true.

27
01:15.870 --> 01:16.880
You're sure it will?

28
01:17.250 --> 01:18.160
Of course!

29
01:18.750 --> 01:19.970
Madoka Kaname,

30
01:20.330 --> 01:23.390
what is the wish which you would trade your soul for?

31
01:26.020 --> 01:26.900
I wish...

32
01:35.350 --> 01:38.450
I wish I had the power to erase
witches before they're born.

33
01:38.890 --> 01:40.050
Every single witch,

34
01:40.390 --> 01:42.270
from the past, present and future,

35
01:42.590 --> 01:43.550
everywhere.

36
01:43.640 --> 01:44.420
Ah...

37
01:48.190 --> 01:49.190
That wish...

38
01:49.880 --> 01:53.990
Once it's granted,
it would unravel the fabric of time itself!

39
01:54.320 --> 01:56.770
It violates the laws of karmic destiny!

40
01:57.230 --> 02:00.180
Uh? Are you trying to become a god?

41
02:00.530 --> 02:02.160
I don't care what I become.

42
02:03.410 --> 02:05.020
All the magical girls,

43
02:05.130 --> 02:07.010
who believed in hope and fought witches,

44
02:07.230 --> 02:09.590
I don't want them to suffer or cry anymore.

45
02:10.300 --> 02:11.880
I want them to be at peace.

46
02:13.250 --> 02:15.570
And if that goes against the laws of universe,

47
02:15.820 --> 02:17.550
then I'll just rewrite those laws.

48
02:18.690 --> 02:20.220
That's the only thing I want.

49
02:20.460 --> 02:21.980
It's what I wish for.

50
02:22.020 --> 02:23.970
Now, grant my wish,

51
02:24.240 --> 02:25.930
Incubator!

52
02:49.510 --> 02:53.780
Madoka, do you know how scary that wish you made was?

53
02:54.130 --> 02:55.020
Sort of.

54
02:57.690 --> 02:59.240
You'll be fighting an endless battle,

55
02:59.460 --> 03:01.820
one that stretches from the past to the future,

56
03:01.940 --> 03:03.230
and for all eternity.

57
03:05.060 --> 03:06.680
You'll never be the same.

58
03:06.910 --> 03:09.270
You won't exit as a physical entity anymore.

59
03:09.950 --> 03:11.890
Dying would be a kinder fate.

60
03:12.430 --> 03:14.960
For the rest of time,
you'll live on as an entity,

61
03:15.390 --> 03:18.260
whose sole purpose is to destroy witches.

62
03:18.670 --> 03:19.440
I know.

63
03:19.790 --> 03:20.970
And I'm ready.

64
03:22.070 --> 03:24.980
If someone ever tells me it's a mistake to have hope,

65
03:25.140 --> 03:27.240
well then, I'll just tell them they're wrong,

66
03:27.420 --> 03:29.250
and I'll keep telling them 'til they believe.

67
03:30.020 --> 03:32.030
No matter how many times it takes.

68
03:32.300 --> 03:33.660
Sounds good to me.

69
03:34.020 --> 03:34.940
Huh?

70
03:35.020 --> 03:37.110
If you think you can do it, do it!

71
03:38.750 --> 03:41.070
I mean, you've found your reason to fight, yeah?

72
03:41.500 --> 03:43.520
And you ain't running away anymore, right?

73
03:43.660 --> 03:45.190
So, there's nothing holding you back!

74
03:45.370 --> 03:49.020
Anyway, now it's time to get your
ass in gear and go full steam ahead!

75
03:49.760 --> 03:50.990
Thanks a lot, Kyoko.

76
03:51.640 --> 03:54.880
If that's what you really want,
then it's time you got this back.

77
03:56.330 --> 03:57.290
Here you go.

78
03:57.700 --> 03:58.680
Hehehe...

79
04:01.530 --> 04:03.710
You are not just giving us back our hope,

80
04:04.300 --> 04:06.500
but you are becoming hope itself,

81
04:07.490 --> 04:09.980
the hope of magical girls everywhere.

82
06:53.210 --> 06:54.400
That's enough.

83
06:54.780 --> 06:55.970
It's all right now.

84
06:56.690 --> 06:59.240
You don't have to hate anyone anymore.

85
06:59.710 --> 07:02.960
And you don't have to curse anyone anymore either.

86
07:03.180 --> 07:07.960
I'll go back before you turned into this,
and take the burden of all your pain.

87
07:11.900 --> 07:13.120
Uh...

88
07:22.320 --> 07:23.310
Ah!

89
07:37.940 --> 07:39.260
Where is this place?

90
07:39.430 --> 07:42.250
The universe is in the process of reordering itself,

91
07:42.420 --> 07:44.790
based on Madoka's new laws of reality.

92
07:46.230 --> 07:47.340
That's right.

93
07:47.610 --> 07:51.420
Your magic gives you the power
to travel back and forth in time.

94
07:52.000 --> 07:56.640
Would you like to see how the existence
called Madoka Kaname meets her ultimate end?

95
07:59.180 --> 08:01.590
That's the Soul Gem her wish created.

96
08:01.760 --> 08:03.020
Impressive, isn't it?

97
08:03.320 --> 08:04.420
No way...

98
08:07.110 --> 08:09.460
The wish she made carries a heavy burden,

99
08:09.710 --> 08:12.650
imagine all the curses she'll have to take on now.

100
08:13.560 --> 08:17.450
With all the hope she's harnessing,
she's giving birth to a new universe.

101
08:17.970 --> 08:20.770
But that means her eventual despair will be so great,

102
08:20.960 --> 08:23.040
it would destroy another universe.

103
08:23.910 --> 08:25.240
It's only natural.

104
08:48.110 --> 08:49.150
Ahh...

105
08:56.980 --> 08:58.980
No, it's all right.

106
08:59.370 --> 09:00.390
Ah...

107
09:02.870 --> 09:03.850
Remember?

108
09:03.980 --> 09:06.450
I wished for the power to erase all witches.

109
09:09.750 --> 09:12.610
And if what I wished for really did come true,

110
09:12.880 --> 09:14.420
then even I...

111
09:14.770 --> 09:17.270
...don't have a thing to worry about,

112
09:17.410 --> 09:18.700
ever!

113
09:40.510 --> 09:41.640
Madoka...

114
09:41.780 --> 09:45.830
Because of your wish,
your life has no beginning or end anymore.

115
09:48.480 --> 09:50.770
The proof of your life on earth is gone.

116
09:50.910 --> 09:53.120
The memories people had of you don't exit.

117
09:53.650 --> 09:55.900
You've crossed over onto a higher plane.

118
09:56.140 --> 09:57.910
Your physical body is no more.

119
09:58.190 --> 09:59.760
You're now a concept.

120
10:00.270 --> 10:02.460
No one will ever sense your presence again,

121
10:02.560 --> 10:04.790
and you will never be able to interact with anyone.

122
10:05.290 --> 10:08.050
You are no longer a part of this universe.

123
10:08.960 --> 10:10.030
What are you saying?

124
10:10.470 --> 10:13.790
Do you honestly think Madoka would want this to happen?

125
10:13.880 --> 10:16.470
After everything she's done,
this is her reward?!

126
10:17.070 --> 10:18.460
I don't believe it!

127
10:21.630 --> 10:23.120
I can't believe it...

128
10:23.710 --> 10:25.160
This is worse...

129
10:25.380 --> 10:26.450
than death...

130
10:27.380 --> 10:28.340
Uh-uh.

131
10:28.590 --> 10:29.990
That's not true, Homura.

132
10:31.150 --> 10:35.460
Now I can see everything that's ever happened,
and everything that ever will.

133
10:35.740 --> 10:38.130
I see all the universes that could have been,

134
10:38.400 --> 10:41.480
and all the universes that are waiting to be born.

135
10:41.640 --> 10:42.570
Really.

136
10:43.040 --> 10:44.160
Madoka...

137
10:44.380 --> 10:46.980
I see it all,
and I finally know...

138
10:47.640 --> 10:49.920
I know all the things you've done for me

139
10:50.180 --> 10:52.600
through out all those different timelines.

140
10:53.050 --> 10:54.140
All of it.

141
10:54.980 --> 10:57.780
All the times you cried and all the time you got hurt,

142
10:58.040 --> 11:00.390
but you kept fighting for me.

143
11:01.610 --> 11:03.950
I'm so sorry I never knew until now...

144
11:04.760 --> 11:06.450
I'm so sorry.

145
11:06.540 --> 11:07.650
Mm.

146
11:15.130 --> 11:17.060
I had to become what I am now,

147
11:17.300 --> 11:19.720
to really know the kind of person you are.

148
11:19.950 --> 11:21.440
And you were there all alone,

149
11:21.560 --> 11:24.640
the most amazing friend
someone like me could ever have.

150
11:25.270 --> 11:27.470
I'm so glad I know now.

151
11:28.230 --> 11:30.540
So, thank you, Homura.

152
11:31.520 --> 11:35.240
For all that's happened,
you truly were my very best friend.

153
11:35.240 --> 11:36.050
But...

154
11:36.220 --> 11:38.350
what's gonna happen to you now that you're like this?

155
11:38.740 --> 11:40.520
You don't have a home to go anymore...

156
11:40.700 --> 11:43.200
You'll never be able to see your family and friends...

157
11:43.460 --> 11:44.750
And you'll be stuck here,

158
11:44.930 --> 11:47.840
alone by yourself forever and ever..!

159
11:47.930 --> 11:48.750
Mm-hm.

160
11:49.170 --> 11:50.340
But I'm not alone.

161
11:50.590 --> 11:54.090
You're always going to be with me,
and so will everyone else.

162
11:54.540 --> 11:58.660
Because from now on,
I'll be everywhere for all time.

163
11:59.090 --> 12:01.780
Even if you can't see me or hear me,

164
12:02.040 --> 12:04.630
I'll be right there by your side, Homura.

165
12:04.900 --> 12:06.000
Madoka...

166
12:06.160 --> 12:07.380
Is that what you want?

167
12:07.550 --> 12:09.810
Even if I don't remember you ever again?

168
12:10.400 --> 12:11.960
How am I gonna know you're there

169
12:12.060 --> 12:15.400
when I can't even feel you're
standing next to me anymore?

170
12:15.410 --> 12:16.470
Uh-uh.

171
12:16.640 --> 12:18.750
It's a little soon to be giving up hope.

172
12:19.070 --> 12:22.600
You managed to follow me all
the way out here, didn't you?

173
12:23.100 --> 12:26.880
Besides, even though you're going back to your world,

174
12:28.400 --> 12:30.040
maybe you'll still remember me.

175
12:30.380 --> 12:32.210
I mean, you never know, right?

176
12:36.370 --> 12:38.550
You'll see, everything will be fine.

177
12:39.210 --> 12:40.380
Just believe.

178
12:41.020 --> 12:41.950
Madoka...

179
12:42.810 --> 12:44.810
We are magical girls, remember?

180
12:44.930 --> 12:46.930
We make hopes and dreams come true.

181
12:49.400 --> 12:51.310
They might not happen all the time,

182
12:51.500 --> 12:54.060
but there's no doubt miracles can really happen.

183
12:54.510 --> 12:55.450
Don't you think?

184
12:55.700 --> 12:56.550
Madoka!

185
12:56.650 --> 12:57.920
Please don't go!

186
12:58.340 --> 12:59.300
Sorry.

187
12:59.440 --> 13:01.240
I've gotta go meet the others now.

188
13:03.170 --> 13:05.730
I don't know when, but I will see you again, Homura.

189
13:05.980 --> 13:06.920
Promise.

190
13:07.660 --> 13:11.330
So, until then, take care of yourself, okay?

191
13:12.180 --> 13:15.170
Madoka!!!!

192
13:32.150 --> 13:35.020
No.25, Kyosuke Kamijo.

193
13:36.070 --> 13:39.680
I will be performing "Ave Maria."

194
13:52.700 --> 13:53.600
Sorry.

195
13:53.850 --> 13:55.780
I guess I caused you a log of trouble.

196
13:55.950 --> 13:56.930
No.

197
13:57.050 --> 13:58.610
I should apologize to you.

198
13:59.160 --> 14:00.450
In order to save you,

199
14:00.710 --> 14:03.920
I don't have a choice but to
erase everything that's happened.

200
14:04.710 --> 14:08.350
But I if I do that, this future will have to disappear.

201
14:09.340 --> 14:12.030
I know this isn't the way you
thought things would turn out,

202
14:12.290 --> 14:14.990
but I do think this is the way you'd want it to be.

203
14:18.270 --> 14:22.410
Your wish was a precious gift,
and you sacrificed so much for it.

204
14:22.600 --> 14:24.910
I have to honor it, respect it.

205
14:25.100 --> 14:26.920
Because it wasn't meaningless.

206
14:27.570 --> 14:28.460
So...

207
14:30.990 --> 14:32.370
Mm-hm.

208
14:33.090 --> 14:34.200
I'm okay with that.

209
14:35.440 --> 14:37.320
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

210
14:37.990 --> 14:41.890
I mean, all I really wanted was
to hear him play again, you know.

211
14:42.280 --> 14:45.220
I wanted everyone to hear him play that violin of his.

212
14:45.500 --> 14:47.110
The more people the better.

213
14:47.530 --> 14:50.030
Just remembering that again is enough for me.

214
14:51.240 --> 14:53.580
I don't have any regrets anymore.

215
14:54.180 --> 14:56.920
I guess one thing still bothers me a little.

216
14:57.420 --> 14:59.620
That is Hitomi, so let it slide.

217
15:00.080 --> 15:02.530
Kyosuke doesn't deserve a girl as cool as her.

218
15:03.670 --> 15:07.200
I'm sure the two of them will be very happy, won't they?

219
15:10.210 --> 15:11.430
Mm-hm.

220
15:13.390 --> 15:15.360
Well, are you ready to go?

221
15:16.150 --> 15:17.600
Yeah...

222
15:45.140 --> 15:46.730
...Sayaka?

223
15:49.570 --> 15:50.390
Ah!

224
15:54.080 --> 15:55.260
Where's Sayaka?

225
15:55.440 --> 15:56.590
What's up? She was just here!

226
15:57.270 --> 15:58.300
She's gone.

227
15:58.640 --> 16:01.130
The Law of Cycle said it has to be this way.

228
16:01.740 --> 16:04.830
Sayaka used up all her power just now.

229
16:05.170 --> 16:07.600
That last attack drained all of her magic.

230
16:08.900 --> 16:10.150
That idiot!

231
16:10.400 --> 16:12.670
What the hell? She didn't have to go out like that,

232
16:12.820 --> 16:15.360
especially over some guy she was crushing on..!

233
16:16.440 --> 16:17.480
Dammit!

234
16:17.720 --> 16:20.140
We were just getting around to being friends...

235
16:20.730 --> 16:23.120
It's the fate of all magical girls though.

236
16:23.550 --> 16:27.020
I'm sure you understood that fact
when you first got your powers.

237
16:27.590 --> 16:29.080
We're supposed to bring hope.

238
16:29.400 --> 16:33.860
But once it turns into despair,
we have no choice but to disappear...

239
16:34.510 --> 16:35.680
forever.

240
16:41.230 --> 16:42.700
Madoka...

241
16:43.570 --> 16:44.690
Huh?

242
16:44.870 --> 16:46.420
What, Homura?

243
16:47.290 --> 16:49.530
Who is this, Madoka?

244
16:50.440 --> 16:51.770
Yeah, who is she?

245
17:04.320 --> 17:05.380
Oh...

246
17:07.980 --> 17:09.910
Madoka, Madoka!

247
17:10.870 --> 17:11.750
Uh-huh.

248
17:12.020 --> 17:13.360
You draw really well.

249
17:13.530 --> 17:14.700
Looks just like her.

250
17:17.620 --> 17:19.640
No, Tatsuya! That's not nice.

251
17:19.910 --> 17:22.160
Don't go around pulling girl's hair, okay?

252
17:22.530 --> 17:26.690
Madoka, Madoka, Madoka!

253
17:27.240 --> 17:28.090
Oh, I'm fine.

254
17:28.320 --> 17:30.190
I was walking by and noticed his drawing.

255
17:31.740 --> 17:33.830
Madoka, is that right?

256
17:34.970 --> 17:37.590
...Uh-huh.

257
17:40.850 --> 17:42.470
Here I come!

258
17:42.480 --> 17:43.450
Come on, then!

259
17:44.110 --> 17:44.930
Yeah!

260
17:46.070 --> 17:47.070
That's it!

261
17:47.390 --> 17:51.170
Tatsuya came up with an imaginary
friend to play with when he's alone?

262
17:51.340 --> 17:54.290
I guess it is not that strange for someone his age.

263
17:54.550 --> 17:55.660
No, it's not.

264
17:56.090 --> 17:57.450
I used to do that, too.

265
17:57.910 --> 17:58.610
Wait.

266
17:58.880 --> 18:00.630
Do you know who "Madoka" is?

267
18:00.820 --> 18:03.270
Is she some kind of anime character or something?

268
18:03.480 --> 18:05.150
I don't know, maybe.

269
18:05.410 --> 18:07.590
I've heard that name before,
but I'm not sure where.

270
18:07.920 --> 18:10.170
I must've met her somewhere...

271
18:10.370 --> 18:12.530
maybe when I was out with Tatsuya..?

272
18:13.700 --> 18:15.160
Hm...

273
18:15.280 --> 18:16.490
It's funny...

274
18:16.890 --> 18:21.140
I don't know why but when I heard that name,
I started getting all nostalgic.

275
18:22.090 --> 18:23.530
Madoka...

276
18:25.650 --> 18:26.820
It's cute name...

277
18:28.170 --> 18:31.630
You know that the ribbon has
got to be the cutest thing ever.

278
18:31.850 --> 18:35.920
And exactly the kind I like too,
same color, same style, everything.

279
18:36.960 --> 18:38.900
You can have it if you want.

280
18:39.260 --> 18:40.080
Hahaha...

281
18:40.320 --> 18:42.970
Thanks, but I'm a little too old to make it work.

282
18:43.210 --> 18:47.340
But if I had a daughter,
I would've made her wear one just like it.

283
18:53.090 --> 18:54.210
Hmm...

284
18:54.310 --> 18:55.390
Interesting.

285
18:55.790 --> 19:00.470
I suppose the system you just
described could work, theoretically.

286
19:00.720 --> 19:01.740
It was real.

287
19:01.830 --> 19:03.310
Nothing theoretical about it.

288
19:07.530 --> 19:09.940
Well, either way, how would we prove such a thing?

289
19:10.380 --> 19:13.620
This reality with its rules,
it's the only one we have to go by.

290
19:13.910 --> 19:16.030
So if the laws of the universe were all altered,

291
19:16.190 --> 19:18.280
the method to verify it wouldn't exit.

292
19:18.640 --> 19:21.210
And since you're the only one who remembers that world,

293
19:21.260 --> 19:23.780
there's no way to prove your memories are real,

294
19:24.020 --> 19:26.180
or it's something your imagination cooked up.

295
19:28.980 --> 19:33.740
I'll admit, we don't know why Soul Gems
shatter when they can't be purified anymore.

296
19:34.000 --> 19:36.720
That's the phenomenon we're still trying to figure out.

297
19:37.190 --> 19:42.220
But going back to this witch concept of yours,
I find it very interesting.

298
19:42.760 --> 19:47.150
As a method of collecting the energy
of human emotions, it's very appealing.

299
19:47.390 --> 19:50.030
If that kind of system really existed,

300
19:50.260 --> 19:54.590
us Incubators would've come up with a
completely different set of tactics.

301
19:55.230 --> 19:58.890
Naturally, after all,
that's the kind of creatures you are.

302
19:59.360 --> 20:02.600
There were a lot of intriguing
things about that witch world though,

303
20:02.840 --> 20:05.240
we didn't have to fight wraiths as we do here.

304
20:05.520 --> 20:09.370
Collecting curses in that other world
seems like it was a much simpler process.

305
20:09.570 --> 20:11.400
It wasn't really as simple as you think.

306
20:11.680 --> 20:15.580
And our relationship with you was
...a little on the rocky side.

307
20:15.910 --> 20:16.880
Hmm...

308
20:17.090 --> 20:19.920
I guess I'll never fully understand human values.

309
20:46.050 --> 20:48.750
The air's thick with dread tonight, isn't it?

310
20:48.890 --> 20:52.060
And these wraiths just keep coming
no matter how many we destroy.

311
20:52.200 --> 20:53.690
There's no end to them.

312
20:53.840 --> 20:55.340
Your complaining isn't going to help.

313
20:55.610 --> 20:57.580
Come on, let's go.

314
10:29.870 --> 10:30.760
Ah!

315
17:24.150 --> 17:25.430
Sorry about that.

316
17:25.690 --> 17:26.890
Are you okay?

317
06:06.700 --> 06:07.820
<i>Don't worry.</i>

318
06:08.140 --> 06:10.840
<i>I won't let your wishes end in despair.</i>

319
06:20.110 --> 06:23.750
<i>None of you have to hate anyone,
or curse anyone.</i>

320
06:24.180 --> 06:26.460
<i>I'm here to take all that burden for you.</i>

321
06:27.110 --> 06:28.250
<i>So please,</i>

322
06:28.580 --> 06:30.460
<i>keep believing in yourselves,</i>

323
06:30.710 --> 06:32.260
<i>to the very end.</i>

324
20:26.060 --> 20:28.530
<i>Even though witches aren't born into this world anymore,</i>

325
20:28.800 --> 20:32.410
<i>that doesn't mean the curses of the
world have complete disappeared.</i>

326
20:33.560 --> 20:35.790
<i>They just changed their form, is all.</i>

327
20:36.610 --> 20:39.670
<i>Now, they attack us from the shadows...</i>

328
21:01.810 --> 21:06.520
<i>This world isn't worth saving,
tragedies and sadness will never truly disappear.</i>

329
21:07.390 --> 21:11.510
<i>But even so, it's the place she once tried to protect.</i>

330
21:17.880 --> 21:19.070
<i>I remember that.</i>

331
21:20.410 --> 21:22.530
<i>And I will never ever forget it.</i>

332
21:24.100 --> 21:25.310
<i>That's why...</i>

333
21:26.480 --> 21:27.710
<i>I keep fighting.</i>

334
23:29.560 --> 23:31.330
<i>Do your best...</i>
