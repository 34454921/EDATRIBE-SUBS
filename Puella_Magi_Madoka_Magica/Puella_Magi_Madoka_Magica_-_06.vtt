1
00:03.200 --> 00:04.110
Game over!

2
00:24.320 --> 00:25.490
Homura...?

3
00:26.150 --> 00:26.900
But...

4
00:27.080 --> 00:28.020
It's you.

5
00:28.600 --> 00:29.360
Gah.

6
00:29.530 --> 00:31.400
Okay, hold it, how did you do that?

7
00:31.560 --> 00:32.470
Ah?

8
00:33.960 --> 00:35.450
Oh, now I get it.

9
00:35.560 --> 00:37.590
You're that "irregularity" I heard about.

10
00:38.010 --> 00:39.980
You got a weird technique, don't ya?

11
00:40.830 --> 00:42.120
Stay out of our way!

12
00:48.310 --> 00:49.300
Sayaka!

13
00:52.590 --> 00:53.830
She's all right.

14
00:54.030 --> 00:55.050
She just passed out.

15
00:55.880 --> 00:56.770
What the heck?

16
00:57.040 --> 00:58.850
Whose side are you on, anyway?

17
00:59.320 --> 01:01.630
I'm on the side of those who think rationally,

18
01:01.910 --> 01:04.100
and the enemy of idiots who pick fights.

19
01:04.610 --> 01:07.680
I wonder which you belong to, Kyoko Sakura?

20
01:11.230 --> 01:13.150
Have we met somewhere before?

21
01:13.410 --> 01:14.340
Perhaps.

22
01:14.470 --> 01:15.380
Who knows?

23
01:24.550 --> 01:27.460
Okay, mystery girl, you keep your secrets.

24
01:27.560 --> 01:28.970
Today's a wash anyway.

25
01:29.220 --> 01:30.290
I'm outta here.

26
01:30.480 --> 01:31.530
Good idea.

27
01:38.280 --> 01:39.660
You saved Sayaka.

28
01:40.190 --> 01:41.350
But I thought you...

29
01:42.790 --> 01:44.800
How many times have I warned you?

30
01:45.040 --> 01:47.430
How stupid can you possibly be?

31
01:49.970 --> 01:52.680
I thought I made it clear you were not to get involved.

32
01:52.970 --> 01:55.260
I don't know why you keep annoying me.

33
01:56.130 --> 01:57.840
It's not that I...

34
01:58.080 --> 02:02.000
If I can't reason with you,
I'll use more drastic measures.

35
02:08.660 --> 02:11.170
She can't mean it, can she?

36
02:12.080 --> 02:15.550
One thing's for certain,
we have to be careful now.

37
02:16.320 --> 02:17.610
She's planning something,

38
02:19.810 --> 02:22.710
aren't you, Homura Akemi?

39
04:02.510 --> 04:04.310
You should be okay for a while now.

40
04:04.760 --> 04:06.590
Ew, it's totally black!

41
04:06.940 --> 04:08.100
And now it's dangerous.

42
04:08.370 --> 04:11.430
If it absorbs any more darkness,
a witch could hatch from it.

43
04:11.610 --> 04:12.450
Huh?!

44
04:12.640 --> 04:14.590
Don't worry. Give it to me.

45
04:22.830 --> 04:24.960
Uh... There.

46
04:25.240 --> 04:26.010
Now, we're safe.

47
04:26.720 --> 04:28.000
Did you just eat it?

48
04:28.250 --> 04:28.910
Yes.

49
04:29.090 --> 04:30.570
It's one of my many duties.

50
04:32.610 --> 04:33.400
Listen.

51
04:33.530 --> 04:38.490
We have to hurry and find another Grief Seed
before your Soul Gem needs to be purified again.

52
04:39.050 --> 04:41.100
My Soul Gem was just a little cloudy.

53
04:41.320 --> 04:43.280
Is it really that important to keep it clean?

54
04:43.420 --> 04:45.840
Kyoko Sakura was strong, wasn't she?

55
04:46.180 --> 04:47.010
Hm...

56
04:47.190 --> 04:50.330
The thing about Grief Seeds are
that if you have enough of them,

57
04:50.510 --> 04:52.510
you'll freely use as much magic as you want.

58
04:52.890 --> 04:54.770
That's why Kyoko's so strong.

59
04:55.060 --> 04:57.420
I can't do that, letting innocent people get hurt

60
04:57.700 --> 04:59.760
just so I can find more Grief Seeds.

61
05:00.240 --> 05:04.060
But the more magic you use,
the more polluted your Soul Gem will become.

62
05:04.510 --> 05:08.930
Sayaka, you'll never defeat Kyoko until
you have more Grief Seeds in reserve.

63
05:09.310 --> 05:11.250
That's the reality of the situation.

64
05:11.460 --> 05:12.200
Hm...

65
05:12.510 --> 05:14.500
Thanks a lot for the vote of confidence.

66
05:16.260 --> 05:17.820
But, what about Mami?

67
05:18.020 --> 05:21.210
She didn't have tons of Grief
Seeds to keep her Soul Gem clean.

68
05:21.630 --> 05:23.710
She didn't seem to have any trouble fighting.

69
05:24.080 --> 05:25.100
Why is that?

70
05:25.220 --> 05:27.430
Is it because she was better at it than me?

71
05:27.650 --> 05:29.330
Oh, she was much more talented.

72
05:30.790 --> 05:31.980
Aw...

73
05:32.190 --> 05:33.810
That's so not fair!

74
05:34.410 --> 05:35.840
You can't do anything about it.

75
05:36.040 --> 05:38.480
Kyoko has a talent for it, and she's a veteran.

76
05:38.740 --> 05:42.120
Although, there is someone without any experience at all

77
05:42.220 --> 05:45.320
whose natural talent exceeds Kyoko's by a wide margin.

78
05:45.700 --> 05:47.530
Huh? Who are you talking about?

79
05:47.870 --> 05:48.910
Madoka Kaname.

80
05:51.120 --> 05:52.250
You're kidding me?

81
05:52.870 --> 05:53.890
You're not kidding me.

82
05:54.540 --> 05:55.390
I'm not.

83
05:55.570 --> 05:57.390
But it puts you in an interesting position.

84
05:57.780 --> 05:59.430
If you are not strong enough to beat Kyoko,

85
05:59.690 --> 06:01.810
you could ask Madoka to do it for you,

86
06:02.390 --> 06:04.540
provided she makes a contract with me.

87
06:04.690 --> 06:06.310
Uh-uh. No way!

88
06:07.540 --> 06:10.380
And besides, this is something I've gotta do.

89
06:11.010 --> 06:12.980
I'm not gonna let her get dragged into it.

90
06:33.830 --> 06:35.240
I-I'm a little busy.

91
06:35.500 --> 06:36.350
What do you want?

92
06:36.730 --> 06:39.370
I wanna let you know you can have this city.

93
06:39.490 --> 06:41.740
Ah... what's up?

94
06:41.920 --> 06:43.370
Why the sudden change of heart?

95
06:43.560 --> 06:46.810
A girl like you is more suited for
what it takes to be a magical girl.

96
06:47.160 --> 06:48.510
Sayaka Miki is not.

97
06:49.330 --> 06:49.940
Hmph!

98
06:50.060 --> 06:51.960
Tell me something I don't already know.

99
06:52.290 --> 06:54.310
What happens if she doesn't agree with you?

100
06:54.530 --> 06:57.000
If I leave her alone,
she's gonna start bugging me again.

101
06:57.290 --> 06:59.160
I want to settle this thing peacefully.

102
06:59.400 --> 07:01.490
So, I'd like you to stay out of it.

103
07:01.860 --> 07:03.280
Let me handle her.

104
07:05.070 --> 07:07.790
You still haven't told me what I really wanna know.

105
07:10.060 --> 07:11.780
Who are you anyway, huh?

106
07:14.070 --> 07:15.690
What's in this for you?

107
07:16.780 --> 07:20.880
Two weeks from today,
a witch called "Walpurgisnacht" will come.

108
07:22.190 --> 07:23.600
How do you know that?

109
07:24.000 --> 07:25.420
That's my business.

110
07:25.920 --> 07:30.060
Anyway, if we defeat the witch,
I will leave this city all to you.

111
07:30.560 --> 07:32.270
You can do whatever you want with it then.

112
07:32.850 --> 07:33.870
Oh, yeah?

113
07:35.970 --> 07:37.680
Walpurgisnacht, huh?

114
07:38.540 --> 07:42.330
If she's too tough for one person to
beat, we could team up and take her on.

115
07:49.660 --> 07:50.900
Want some?

116
07:59.330 --> 08:00.250
It's no use.

117
08:00.500 --> 08:01.770
Too much time has passed.

118
08:02.210 --> 08:04.640
We can't trace the familiar from last night.

119
08:05.250 --> 08:07.340
Grats.

120
08:08.600 --> 08:10.130
Hey, Sayaka?

121
08:11.830 --> 08:16.450
If you keep doing this, hunting witches and
stuff, won't you run into that girl again?

122
08:17.190 --> 08:19.850
Yeah, it's bound to happen some time.

123
08:20.760 --> 08:21.830
Well, I have an idea.

124
08:22.130 --> 08:24.210
Maybe you should find her first and talk to her,

125
08:24.420 --> 08:26.630
you know, to figure out how you can work together.

126
08:26.980 --> 08:30.870
'Cause if you don't and you guys meet
again, you'll just get into another fight.

127
08:33.190 --> 08:34.370
Hold on. A fight?

128
08:34.710 --> 08:38.270
Do you honestly think what happened
last night was just a plain old fight?

129
08:40.010 --> 08:41.000
Well, it wasn't.

130
08:41.230 --> 08:43.680
That was a bona fide battle to the death for reals.

131
08:44.120 --> 08:46.930
But it didn't start out that way,
that's for sure.

132
08:47.130 --> 08:51.410
After a while though, with every blow we were
trying harder and harder to kill each other.

133
08:51.670 --> 08:52.910
But then that's...

134
08:53.180 --> 08:54.690
That's even worse!

135
08:54.790 --> 08:56.410
Hey, you want me to talk to her?

136
08:56.590 --> 08:57.850
That's totally nuts!

137
08:58.000 --> 09:00.590
She said she's okay with letting
people becoming witch foods,

138
09:00.740 --> 09:02.220
so she can get more Grief Seeds!

139
09:02.480 --> 09:04.850
There's no way I get along with someone like that.

140
09:05.840 --> 09:10.690
But Sayaka, you became a magical girl
so you can fight witches, didn't you?

141
09:10.950 --> 09:12.150
She isn't a witch.

142
09:12.320 --> 09:14.630
She's a magical girl just like you.

143
09:15.920 --> 09:17.060
Give her a chance.

144
09:17.170 --> 09:18.960
I'm sure you can find a way to work together.

145
09:19.200 --> 09:20.850
Even if she does things differently,

146
09:21.070 --> 09:23.760
you both feel the same way about
hunting witches, don't you?

147
09:24.960 --> 09:26.190
I'm sure she does.

148
09:27.130 --> 09:28.850
And I'm sure Homura does, too.

149
09:30.230 --> 09:33.790
If Mami and Homura would've gotten
along, maybe Mami would...

150
09:33.910 --> 09:35.060
You're kidding, right?!

151
09:35.790 --> 09:37.290
Come on, you were there, Madoka.

152
09:37.680 --> 09:40.300
She waited until that witch killed Mami.

153
09:40.550 --> 09:42.570
Then she shows up like she wants to help.

154
09:42.940 --> 09:46.580
She just wanted Grief Seeds,
so she sat back and let Mami die!

155
09:47.350 --> 09:49.480
That's not...what happened.

156
09:49.780 --> 09:51.250
No, they are both the same,

157
09:51.340 --> 09:53.730
that transfer student and that damn Kyoko girl.

158
09:53.970 --> 09:55.950
They don't care about anything but themselves.

159
09:57.480 --> 09:59.010
But Mami wasn't like them.

160
09:59.280 --> 10:02.280
She was the exception to what
magical girls are really like.

161
10:02.550 --> 10:03.730
You know what?

162
10:03.800 --> 10:05.280
They're like those two.

163
10:05.720 --> 10:06.480
No...

164
10:06.600 --> 10:07.500
You're wrong.

165
10:07.740 --> 10:10.300
You know, that familiar we saw
last night was pretty small,

166
10:10.470 --> 10:12.010
but it could still kill someone.

167
10:12.220 --> 10:15.600
Maybe it'll come after your dad next, or your mom.

168
10:15.720 --> 10:18.000
What would you do if it came after Tatsuya, huh?

169
10:18.210 --> 10:19.410
Would you be okay with that?

170
10:19.870 --> 10:22.160
Could you forgive anyone who let them die?

171
10:23.790 --> 10:26.390
I didn't want this power so I can fight witches.

172
10:26.670 --> 10:30.850
I wanted it so I have the strength to do
what's right and protect the ones I love.

173
10:31.470 --> 10:32.340
You get it?

174
10:32.520 --> 10:35.240
If there are people out there
who are worse than witches,

175
10:35.460 --> 10:36.940
then I'm gonna fight them,

176
10:37.130 --> 10:39.510
especially if they're magical girls.

177
10:41.370 --> 10:42.520
But Sayaka...

178
10:47.560 --> 10:49.730
Kyubey, why don't you say something?

179
10:50.900 --> 10:54.070
The only thing I can really say
is that she's behaving recklessly.

180
10:54.840 --> 10:59.810
Sayaka doesn't have a chance of defeating
either Homura Akemi or Kyoko Sakura.

181
11:00.160 --> 11:04.580
Besides, even if I did warn her,
do you think she'd listen to me?

182
11:40.040 --> 11:40.930
Uh...

183
11:43.440 --> 11:45.830
Mm... Can't sleep, huh?

184
11:46.270 --> 11:47.060
Mm...

185
11:47.310 --> 11:48.280
Can we talk?

186
12:00.620 --> 12:04.260
There's this friend of mine.
She's in trouble.

187
12:04.960 --> 12:08.660
I don't think she's doing or
saying anything wrong, but...

188
12:09.140 --> 12:11.580
She keeps trying to do the right thing.

189
12:12.080 --> 12:15.560
But the harder she tries,
the worse things get for her...

190
12:16.160 --> 12:17.660
Sure, that happens a lot.

191
12:18.010 --> 12:18.640
Really?

192
12:18.960 --> 12:20.930
Yes. Sad but true.

193
12:21.100 --> 12:25.330
Just because you keep trying to do the right thing
doesn't mean you're guaranteed a happy ending.

194
12:25.850 --> 12:29.660
In fact, the more stubborn a person
gets about what they think is right,

195
12:29.790 --> 12:31.370
the less happy they are going to be.

196
12:31.610 --> 12:34.060
It's like they stop being rational all together.

197
12:35.100 --> 12:37.330
It's not fair to be unhappy,

198
12:38.330 --> 12:40.660
especially if you're not doing anything wrong.

199
12:41.010 --> 12:41.840
Uh-huh.

200
12:42.300 --> 12:44.730
So then, what do you think I should do?

201
12:45.810 --> 12:50.370
Well, at this point, I doubt that it'd end
on a happy note no matter what anyone did.

202
12:51.080 --> 12:52.030
Huh...

203
12:55.060 --> 12:58.550
If the only way to help was to do
something drastic, would you do it?

204
12:59.110 --> 12:59.860
Yeah...

205
13:00.320 --> 13:02.700
Then you should do something wrong.

206
13:03.150 --> 13:04.020
Huh?

207
13:04.800 --> 13:09.290
If she so focused on what she thinks is right,
try doing something wrong to snap her out of it.

208
13:09.510 --> 13:11.230
I don't get it. How?

209
13:11.460 --> 13:14.910
You could tell a big fat lie,
or chicken out when the going gets tough.

210
13:15.310 --> 13:20.100
You never know, sometimes doing the wrong thing
for someone is exactly the right thing to do.

211
13:20.540 --> 13:24.540
If you find yourself at the dead end
and there's no other options left,

212
13:24.670 --> 13:27.930
doing something the wrong way might do the most good.

213
13:28.560 --> 13:31.250
But, will she understand that I'm doing it for her sake?

214
13:31.540 --> 13:32.990
That I'm just trying to help her?

215
13:33.370 --> 13:35.710
Well, she might not get it right away.

216
13:35.890 --> 13:37.460
She might even hate you.

217
13:37.800 --> 13:39.000
See what I mean?

218
13:39.250 --> 13:41.230
We're talking some drastic stuff here.

219
13:41.500 --> 13:46.030
But ask yourself this, what's better?
Doing nothing or doing something?

220
13:46.400 --> 13:47.070
Mm-hm.

221
13:48.480 --> 13:51.450
I have to say I did a good job raising you.

222
13:51.750 --> 13:53.300
You don't do anything bad.

223
13:53.430 --> 13:54.290
You've never told a lie.

224
13:54.680 --> 13:57.610
You always try to do the right thing no matter what.

225
13:58.580 --> 14:01.120
You passed childhood with flying colors.

226
14:03.810 --> 14:06.300
Here's the thing though, before you grow up,

227
14:06.410 --> 14:09.240
you should learn how to make the right kind of mistakes.

228
14:09.900 --> 14:10.860
How can I?

229
14:11.270 --> 14:12.250
I don't get it.

230
14:12.620 --> 14:16.090
You are still young, so it's easy
to bounce back after getting hurt.

231
14:16.340 --> 14:20.440
If you learn how to take life's little hits
now, it'll help you later on.

232
14:21.110 --> 14:25.250
See, the older you get,
the bigger the consequences are if you mess up.

233
14:25.490 --> 14:29.330
The more responsibilities you have,
the less mistakes you're allowed to make.

234
14:29.690 --> 14:30.570
Hmm...

235
14:32.590 --> 14:34.670
That sounds really hard.

236
14:34.750 --> 14:37.470
Yeah, sometimes being an adult can really suck.

237
14:38.310 --> 14:41.320
That's why we're allowed to drink alcohol!

238
14:41.910 --> 14:42.710
Hehe.

239
14:42.820 --> 14:46.680
I wanna grow up so bad now,
then you and me can go drinking together.

240
14:46.970 --> 14:49.470
Well, then you'd better hurry up and get older.

241
14:49.820 --> 14:52.930
Even though it's not easy,
it's pretty cool to be a grownup.

242
15:08.560 --> 15:09.460
Uh...

243
15:09.950 --> 15:10.670
Hi, there.

244
15:10.940 --> 15:13.460
If you're here for Kyosuke,
he's already been discharged.

245
15:14.650 --> 15:16.770
He was doing so well with his physical therapy,

246
15:17.020 --> 15:18.630
they decided to let him go home early.

247
15:19.390 --> 15:21.490
Oh, okay. Thank you.

248
15:45.980 --> 15:46.750
Ah...

249
15:48.480 --> 15:53.900
You spent all that time looking for him and
now you're just gonna leave without seeing him?

250
15:54.220 --> 15:55.000
You again.

251
15:55.200 --> 15:56.010
Uh-huh.

252
15:56.160 --> 15:58.070
So this is where the rich boy lives.

253
15:58.310 --> 16:01.270
He's the reason you made a contract with Kyubey, right?

254
16:01.550 --> 16:02.790
Seriously.

255
16:03.060 --> 16:07.440
A once-in-a-lifetime chance at having
anything you want and you wasted it on that.

256
16:08.190 --> 16:09.880
What do you know about anything?

257
16:10.160 --> 16:12.110
I know a lot more than you, dummy!

258
16:12.250 --> 16:15.080
Magic always was and always
should be used for one thing,

259
16:15.280 --> 16:16.700
to grant wishes for yourself.

260
16:16.960 --> 16:20.800
And if you try using it for any other
reason, then it always turns out bad!

261
16:21.740 --> 16:25.650
Don't tell me, Mami Tomoe didn't
even teach you that simple rule?

262
16:29.280 --> 16:33.640
If all you want is to get the guy to love
you, there's better ways of doing it.

263
16:33.840 --> 16:36.410
I mean, you've got all these magic powers now.

264
16:36.410 --> 16:37.050
Hold on.

265
16:37.190 --> 16:41.080
For starters, you could bust in there right
now and break his arms and legs so bad,

266
16:41.250 --> 16:43.000
he'll never be able to use them again.

267
16:43.080 --> 16:43.670
Huh...

268
16:43.670 --> 16:47.320
Make him so helpless,
he won't be able to do anything without you.

269
16:47.580 --> 16:50.540
You do that and he really will be yours and yours alone.

270
16:50.840 --> 16:53.210
Both his body and his soul...

271
16:55.070 --> 16:56.000
How about this?

272
16:56.110 --> 16:59.130
If you don't got the stomach for it,
I could always mess him up for ya.

273
16:59.380 --> 17:01.530
Like a favor between magical girls.

274
17:01.730 --> 17:03.530
It'd be really easy to do.

275
17:04.720 --> 17:05.760
How dare you...

276
17:06.160 --> 17:08.460
I'm not gonna take that kind of talk from you.

277
17:08.870 --> 17:10.400
We're gonna end this now.

278
17:10.990 --> 17:12.590
Let's go some place quiet.

279
17:13.630 --> 17:15.870
We'd attract too much attention here.

280
17:21.600 --> 17:23.660
If she so focused on what she thinks is right,

281
17:23.960 --> 17:26.120
try doing something wrong to snap her out of it.

282
17:27.420 --> 17:29.600
Hmm... How am I gonna do that?

283
17:43.890 --> 17:46.000
We can go all out up here if we want.

284
17:46.290 --> 17:48.220
Come on, give me your best shot!

285
18:06.140 --> 18:06.830
Sayaka!

286
18:07.010 --> 18:07.800
No! Don't!

287
18:09.740 --> 18:10.710
What're you doing?

288
18:10.950 --> 18:11.970
You shouldn't be here.

289
18:12.190 --> 18:13.960
This has nothing to do with you, so stay back!

290
18:15.710 --> 18:16.750
This just can't be right!

291
18:16.830 --> 18:17.390
Hmpf!

292
18:17.490 --> 18:20.140
The annoying bitch has an annoying friend.
Go figure.

293
18:20.570 --> 18:23.400
Well, I wonder what kind of friends you'd have then.

294
18:24.100 --> 18:24.880
Tch...

295
18:25.030 --> 18:26.250
What are you doing?

296
18:26.420 --> 18:28.680
I thought we agreed you'd leave Sayaka Miki alone.

297
18:29.040 --> 18:31.480
Like your way of idea's gonna teach her any manners.

298
18:31.690 --> 18:33.830
Besides, it's not like she's backing down.

299
18:33.830 --> 18:35.200
I'll take her on, then.

300
18:35.440 --> 18:37.070
But you stay out of it. Understand?

301
18:37.150 --> 18:37.750
Hmpf.

302
18:37.970 --> 18:40.100
You got 'til I finish eating this,
then it's on!

303
18:40.310 --> 18:41.480
That's plenty of time.

304
18:42.260 --> 18:43.510
It won't be that easy!

305
18:45.470 --> 18:46.660
Sayaka! I'm sorry!

306
18:47.320 --> 18:48.250
Ugh..?

307
18:50.400 --> 18:51.360
Ya!

308
18:56.110 --> 18:56.870
Ah!

309
18:57.780 --> 18:58.880
Uh...

310
18:58.890 --> 19:00.230
Madoka, why would you do that?

311
19:00.240 --> 19:01.980
But if I didn't, then you would've...

312
19:03.090 --> 19:04.390
Sayaka?

313
19:06.400 --> 19:07.310
Oh, Madoka.

314
19:07.450 --> 19:08.450
That was really bad.

315
19:08.960 --> 19:09.560
Huh?

316
19:09.710 --> 19:11.170
What's wrong with you?
Are you out of your mind?

317
19:11.470 --> 19:13.570
How could you throw your friend away like that?

318
19:13.880 --> 19:14.790
What did you say?

319
19:15.130 --> 19:15.930
What do you mean?

320
19:18.590 --> 19:19.470
No, stop!

321
19:21.450 --> 19:22.960
What the hell is going on here?

322
19:23.260 --> 19:24.670
What is this?

323
19:24.900 --> 19:25.740
She's dead!

324
19:35.860 --> 19:36.930
Sayaka?

325
19:37.360 --> 19:38.730
Hey, Sayaka!

326
19:39.090 --> 19:39.990
Come on, wake up!

327
19:40.170 --> 19:40.920
Wake up!

328
19:41.190 --> 19:42.020
Say something.

329
19:42.280 --> 19:43.300
What's wrong?

330
19:43.560 --> 19:44.150
Hey!

331
19:44.990 --> 19:45.950
I don't want this...

332
19:46.520 --> 19:47.470
Sayaka!

333
19:48.710 --> 19:50.600
What the hell is going on around here?

334
19:53.060 --> 19:53.730
Hey!

335
19:54.280 --> 19:57.150
There's a limit to how far a
magical girl can be from her body.

336
19:57.510 --> 20:00.740
If it's beyond 100 meters, you lose control of it.

337
20:00.990 --> 20:02.010
What does that mean?

338
20:02.230 --> 20:03.290
100 meters?

339
20:03.590 --> 20:04.720
What are you talking about?

340
20:05.060 --> 20:06.830
This kind of thing rarely happens,

341
20:06.990 --> 20:08.830
so I'm not surprised you find it disturbing.

342
20:09.100 --> 20:11.660
Most of the time, you're being
carried around with your bodies.

343
20:11.850 --> 20:13.360
What are you saying, Kyubey?

344
20:13.560 --> 20:14.770
You have to help her!

345
20:14.890 --> 20:16.530
Please don't let Sayaka die!

346
20:17.240 --> 20:18.290
Phew...

347
20:18.560 --> 20:20.990
Madoka, that isn't Sayaka.

348
20:21.420 --> 20:22.780
It's just an empty shell.

349
20:23.990 --> 20:27.170
It's true, you just threw her
off the bridge a minute ago.

350
20:28.380 --> 20:29.070
What did you say?

351
20:32.540 --> 20:37.990
Did you honestly think I'd like you girls fight
witches using those fragile human bodies of yours?

352
20:38.400 --> 20:39.300
That's impossible.

353
20:40.060 --> 20:45.890
For magical girls, the so-called "bodies" you used be
housed in are nothing more than exterior hardware now.

354
20:46.740 --> 20:48.840
Your souls are your real bodies.

355
20:49.110 --> 20:52.880
It's placed inside a compact vessel,
where they're easier to protect,

356
20:53.080 --> 20:55.450
and where you can control your magic more efficiently.

357
20:56.340 --> 21:00.550
Making that happen is part of my
job when I recruit magical girls.

358
21:00.950 --> 21:04.650
I take a person's soul from their
body and turn it into a Soul Gem.

359
21:05.110 --> 21:06.380
You bastard...

360
21:06.600 --> 21:08.190
What have you done...?

361
21:08.550 --> 21:09.690
You scumbag!

362
21:09.800 --> 21:11.300
You've turned us into zombies!

363
21:11.460 --> 21:12.800
Is that what happened?!

364
21:13.070 --> 21:14.420
But isn't it more convenient?

365
21:17.940 --> 21:21.440
If your heart explodes or you
bleed out every last drop of blood,

366
21:21.670 --> 21:25.440
no matter what happens, you just heal
your bodies with magic and get up again.

367
21:26.130 --> 21:29.780
As long as your Soul Gem doesn't get
damaged, you're basically invincible.

368
21:30.250 --> 21:34.410
Isn't it better to have that in a fight than
be trapped in the body prone to failure?

369
21:35.400 --> 21:36.580
That's horrible...

370
21:37.080 --> 21:38.450
That's horrible!

371
21:42.300 --> 21:43.530
It never fails.

372
21:44.100 --> 21:48.100
Whenever I tell you humans this simple facts,
you always react the same way.

373
21:49.120 --> 21:50.580
It makes no sense at all!

374
21:50.830 --> 21:54.880
Why are you humans so sensitive about the
kind of container that souls are housed in?

375
22:21.840 --> 22:22.710
What's up?

376
22:23.190 --> 22:24.290
What happened?

377
23:57.340 --> 23:59.990
You did accept the destiny of fighting witches,

378
24:00.120 --> 24:02.060
provided I grant one wish for you.

379
24:02.360 --> 24:04.420
That wish has come true, hasn't it?

380
24:06.150 --> 24:08.440
Can you face your true feelings?

381
17:30.060 --> 17:30.750
Uh?

382
17:31.520 --> 17:32.370
Huh?

383
18:13.860 --> 18:15.540
Come on, think about what you're doing!

384
18:22.980 --> 18:23.690
Ah?

385
19:25.610 --> 19:26.330
Ah!

386
20:22.780 --> 20:23.540
Huh?

387
20:27.170 --> 20:27.830
Ah.

388
17:29.750 --> 17:30.570
<i>Madoka...</i>

389
17:31.040 --> 17:31.910
<i>Madoka!</i>

390
17:32.580 --> 17:33.200
<i>Hurry.</i>

391
17:33.300 --> 17:34.400
<i>Sayaka is in danger!</i>

392
17:34.820 --> 17:35.610
<i>Come with me!</i>
