00:00.000 --> 00:00.000


2
00:18.800 --> 00:20.940
Oh, are you here to see Kyosuke?

3
00:22.250 --> 00:23.520
Uh-huh.

4
00:24.380 --> 00:25.690
Oh, I'm sorry.

5
00:26.100 --> 00:27.550
His examination got moved up.

6
00:27.860 --> 00:29.640
He's in Physical Therapy right now.

7
00:30.610 --> 00:32.090
Oh, okay then.

8
00:32.550 --> 00:33.720
Thank you.

9
00:36.930 --> 00:38.950
She comes to see him a lot, doesn't she?

10
00:39.630 --> 00:40.870
It's good she does.

11
00:41.360 --> 00:42.800
He's a difficult case.

12
00:43.270 --> 00:45.690
He needs encouragement and I think she gives him that.

13
00:46.090 --> 00:49.340
He was a musical prodigy before the accident, wasn't he?

14
00:49.700 --> 00:50.480
The violin?

15
00:50.650 --> 00:51.330
Yes.

16
00:51.820 --> 00:57.830
But even if he figures out how to walk again,
his fingers will never recover enough to play.

17
01:03.140 --> 01:04.880
Why did it have to be Kyosuke?

18
01:08.050 --> 01:10.410
I can move my fingers as much as I want.

19
01:10.710 --> 01:12.710
But they don't do anything special.

20
01:14.250 --> 01:17.320
Why couldn't it have been me instead of Kyosuke?

21
01:20.490 --> 01:24.970
If I used my wish to heal Kyosuke,
how would he feel about it?

22
01:25.260 --> 01:26.590
Would he just say "thanks?"

23
01:28.320 --> 01:30.700
Nothing else just "thanks" and that's it?

24
01:31.520 --> 01:33.780
Or am I hoping for something more to happen?

25
01:37.560 --> 01:38.850
What am I thinking?

26
01:39.570 --> 01:40.880
I'm horrible.

27
03:26.120 --> 03:26.870
Uh-oh.

28
03:27.580 --> 03:28.400
Hold still.

29
03:28.430 --> 03:29.440
Oh, got it.

30
03:43.850 --> 03:44.660
Madoka.

31
03:45.550 --> 03:47.690
Fast move, kid, you're gonna be late for school.

32
03:48.130 --> 03:49.730
Mm-hm.

33
03:58.250 --> 03:59.010
Huh?

34
04:00.730 --> 04:02.380
Why's Sis crying?

35
04:02.670 --> 04:04.180
What's wrong? Don't you like your breakfast?

36
04:04.770 --> 04:07.580
Yeah... it tastes good...

37
04:08.560 --> 04:09.520
Really good...

38
04:11.190 --> 04:12.150
I'm alive...

39
04:12.430 --> 04:15.730
And your cooking... it tastes so good, Dad...

40
04:17.110 --> 04:19.480
I was all like "Jeez, Yuka!" really!

41
04:19.780 --> 04:22.190
I mean, after all that she still doesn't get it.

42
04:22.470 --> 04:25.120
And then, oh and then, she gets all weepy and goes

43
04:25.200 --> 04:27.030
"What did I say something weird again?"

44
04:27.320 --> 04:31.060
I wanted to laugh so hard but I
held it in for as long as I could.

45
04:35.490 --> 04:36.210
...Me, too!

46
04:36.510 --> 04:39.620
I couldn't, so I just sat there choking back laughs.

47
04:39.570 --> 04:41.350
That's so funny.

48
04:42.350 --> 04:42.980
Ahem.

49
04:43.220 --> 04:46.530
Let's use the prime age for
childbirth in women as an example.

50
04:46.790 --> 04:51.310
Sure, it's based on certain medical
facts, but counting backwards from there,

51
04:51.400 --> 04:54.670
to determine whether a woman's
suitable for marriage is incorrect!

52
04:55.020 --> 04:58.740
Women over the age of 30 are
absolutely suitable for marriage.

53
04:58.970 --> 05:01.290
And there's no scientific proof to the contrary.

54
05:01.490 --> 05:05.020
Now, having said that, and hoping it's
absorbed by your fertile little minds,

55
05:05.180 --> 05:07.240
we should use the present progressive tense here-

56
05:19.040 --> 05:23.370
It sort of...feels like we're
in another country, doesn't it?

57
05:24.940 --> 05:27.880
Even though nothing's changed, our school is the same,

58
05:28.030 --> 05:31.290
our class is the same, Hitomi, nothing's changed.

59
05:31.550 --> 05:34.240
But I feel like I'm surrounded by strangers.

60
05:34.820 --> 05:36.830
No one else knows, that's why.

61
05:38.310 --> 05:40.510
No one knows about witches, or Mami.

62
05:40.960 --> 05:44.620
It's like everyone else is living in
a totally different world than us.

63
05:45.230 --> 05:50.020
You and me, we are the only ones who know about
all the stuff that's been happening lately.

64
05:50.980 --> 05:52.040
Sayaka...

65
05:52.510 --> 05:55.450
Everything changed a long time ago, didn't it?

66
05:55.950 --> 05:59.740
And the two of us should've figured
that out sooner, don't you think?

67
06:02.120 --> 06:07.530
So after all this, what we've seen,
do you still wanna be a magical girl?

68
06:14.310 --> 06:15.870
Yeah, I thought so.

69
06:16.680 --> 06:18.550
Hey, I understand.

70
06:19.770 --> 06:21.460
I-I know it's unfair.

71
06:22.530 --> 06:24.650
I know it's selfish to back out now.

72
06:25.190 --> 06:26.360
But I...

73
06:27.080 --> 06:27.950
I can't...

74
06:28.660 --> 06:31.040
Just thinking about the way she died...

75
06:31.470 --> 06:33.530
Even now, it gets so hard to breathe...

76
06:34.910 --> 06:36.150
I'm scared...

77
06:36.310 --> 06:37.670
I don't want that...!

78
06:42.540 --> 06:46.210
Mami...really was the nicest person.

79
06:47.560 --> 06:50.470
But in order for us to understand what it takes,

80
06:50.640 --> 06:53.190
the kind of courage it takes to fight,

81
06:53.740 --> 06:54.580
she can't...

82
06:57.730 --> 06:58.530
Hey, Kyubey.

83
06:59.150 --> 07:01.020
What's gonna happen around here now?

84
07:01.800 --> 07:07.470
Since Mami's gone, is there someone else around
who's gonna protect everyone from the witches?

85
07:08.330 --> 07:10.520
This town's been Mami's for a long time.

86
07:10.810 --> 07:14.090
Once the other magical girls find
out she's gone, they'll come.

87
07:14.630 --> 07:17.530
I'm sure someone will arrive soon to pick up the hunt.

88
07:18.160 --> 07:19.120
And then what?

89
07:19.500 --> 07:22.180
All they're gonna care about is finding Grief Seeds.

90
07:22.340 --> 07:24.130
Just like that transfer student.

91
07:24.570 --> 07:25.350
It's true.

92
07:25.470 --> 07:27.790
Most magical girls hunt for their own benefit,

93
07:27.900 --> 07:30.060
and it's normal to wanna be paid for your work.

94
07:30.460 --> 07:32.280
But Mami was a rare breed.

95
07:32.550 --> 07:33.370
But then...

96
07:33.480 --> 07:35.870
You don't have the right to judge their actions though.

97
07:36.240 --> 07:38.220
Only magical girls have that right.

98
07:38.680 --> 07:40.520
They share the same destiny after all.

99
07:43.980 --> 07:44.890
Phew.

100
07:45.210 --> 07:46.930
I understand what you're thinking.

101
07:47.270 --> 07:49.990
It's a shame, but I can't force you, can I?

102
07:50.910 --> 07:52.120
Good-bye then.

103
07:52.350 --> 07:56.660
I'm off to search for other girls,
who have a greater need to make a contract with me.

104
07:58.430 --> 08:00.070
I'm sorry, Kyubey.

105
08:00.460 --> 08:03.700
No, I apologize for getting you mixed up in all this.

106
08:04.400 --> 08:07.070
We weren't together for very long, but it was fun.

107
08:07.600 --> 08:09.520
Thank you, Madoka.

108
08:18.990 --> 08:19.880
I'm sorry...

109
08:55.930 --> 08:56.940
I'm sorry...

110
08:57.910 --> 08:59.410
for being so weak.,,

111
09:00.650 --> 09:01.680
I'm sorry...

112
09:14.220 --> 09:15.330
Homura...

113
09:22.530 --> 09:24.370
You shouldn't blame yourself for what happened.

114
09:24.940 --> 09:26.100
It couldn't be helped.

115
09:26.380 --> 09:27.170
Huh?

116
09:27.540 --> 09:29.560
No one can criticize you for anything.

117
09:29.880 --> 09:30.830
I mean that.

118
09:31.610 --> 09:32.320
No one.

119
09:32.720 --> 09:33.750
I won't allow it.

120
09:36.380 --> 09:38.970
So then, have you accepted my warning?

121
09:40.880 --> 09:41.920
Uh-huh...

122
09:45.780 --> 09:50.140
I keep thinking, if only I'd listened to you before...

123
09:50.290 --> 09:53.270
If you had, it wouldn't have changed Mami Tomoe's fate.

124
09:55.550 --> 09:57.510
I was able to change yours though.

125
09:57.850 --> 09:58.630
That's good.

126
09:58.870 --> 10:01.250
So at least I saved one person.

127
10:01.760 --> 10:02.880
I'm glad about that.

128
10:06.000 --> 10:08.020
Um, you know, Homura.

129
10:08.350 --> 10:11.160
I get the feeling you're a veteran at this too.

130
10:11.590 --> 10:13.590
I mean like Mami, but different.

131
10:14.090 --> 10:14.850
Perhaps.

132
10:15.060 --> 10:16.350
I can't deny it.

133
10:19.690 --> 10:20.750
And I guess...

134
10:21.660 --> 10:24.670
you've seen lots of people die horribly, haven't you?

135
10:25.080 --> 10:25.740
I have.

136
10:27.880 --> 10:29.310
How many?

137
10:30.750 --> 10:32.500
I gave up counting long ago.

138
10:36.450 --> 10:39.570
And her place...is it just gonna stay like that?

139
10:40.640 --> 10:41.710
Most likely.

140
10:41.960 --> 10:44.000
She didn't really have any family to speak of.

141
10:45.230 --> 10:48.830
And it'll be a very long time
before she's reported missing.

142
10:49.590 --> 10:52.530
Then, no one's gonna notice Mami's dead?

143
10:54.560 --> 10:56.110
It can't be helped.

144
10:56.650 --> 10:58.730
If you die in a labyrinth, your body stays there.

145
10:59.450 --> 11:03.280
That means in this world,
she'll be considered a missing person forever.

146
11:04.170 --> 11:06.850
It's a fate all magical girls come accord to,

147
11:07.260 --> 11:08.160
eventually.

148
11:22.040 --> 11:23.100
That's awful!

149
11:28.260 --> 11:31.680
She was all alone, she fought to protect everyone...

150
11:32.170 --> 11:34.630
And now you're saying no one will know she's gone..?

151
11:35.420 --> 11:36.920
That's horrible!

152
11:38.670 --> 11:42.660
It's a condition of the contract we
make, in exchange for our powers.

153
11:43.830 --> 11:45.200
We're not protectors.

154
11:46.380 --> 11:49.510
We fight for the sake of our wishes,
and this is how we pay for them.

155
11:50.510 --> 11:52.490
If we die and no one remembers us,

156
11:53.960 --> 11:58.030
I guess that's just the way it is.

157
11:58.220 --> 12:00.230
I'll remember her.

158
12:00.720 --> 12:02.110
I'll never forget her,

159
12:02.570 --> 12:03.500
never.

160
12:04.580 --> 12:05.600
I promise!

161
12:06.960 --> 12:07.880
I see.

162
12:08.680 --> 12:09.960
Mami Tomoe is lucky.

163
12:10.430 --> 12:11.760
She'd be happy to hear that.

164
12:12.790 --> 12:14.170
How I envy her.

165
12:15.330 --> 12:16.570
I won't forget you either!

166
12:17.190 --> 12:21.340
I swear I'll never forget you, Homura,
and how you saved us yesterday!

167
12:21.880 --> 12:23.710
I'm always gonna remember you!

168
12:27.360 --> 12:28.240
Homura?

169
12:30.050 --> 12:30.990
You're too kind.

170
12:31.520 --> 12:32.170
Huh?

171
12:32.890 --> 12:35.380
Remember this, and take it to heart.

172
12:36.060 --> 12:39.080
Kindness sometimes leads to even greater tragedy.

173
13:03.280 --> 13:04.610
What are you listening to?

174
13:05.670 --> 13:07.380
The Girl With the Flaxen Hair.

175
13:07.950 --> 13:09.950
Oh, that's Debussy.

176
13:10.080 --> 13:11.530
It's a beautiful song!

177
13:14.250 --> 13:16.340
Uh, you know what?

178
13:16.460 --> 13:17.470
It's kinda funny but...

179
13:17.840 --> 13:21.920
I don't think people really see me as the type
who listens to stuff like classical music.

180
13:22.250 --> 13:26.130
And whenever I can name a piece correctly,
seriously you should see their faces.

181
13:26.350 --> 13:28.570
It's like they're impressed
that I know about that stuff.

182
13:32.750 --> 13:34.770
Everything I know about it is 'cause of you.

183
13:35.490 --> 13:39.620
Seriously though, I would never
even listen to classical music ever,

184
13:39.850 --> 13:41.540
if it wasn't for you, you know.

185
13:42.160 --> 13:43.190
Hey, Sayaka...

186
13:43.400 --> 13:44.160
Huh?

187
13:45.180 --> 13:46.210
Yeah?

188
13:47.670 --> 13:48.560
Cut it out.

189
13:48.760 --> 13:50.350
Stop torturing me already.

190
13:55.030 --> 13:56.360
Why do you keep coming here?

191
13:56.620 --> 13:58.450
You think I like listening to this music?

192
13:59.040 --> 14:00.480
It's like you're trying to hurt me.

193
14:01.850 --> 14:04.820
But, Kyosuke, I-I thought you loved music.

194
14:04.450 --> 14:06.340
I don't wanna hear this crap anymore!

195
14:06.620 --> 14:08.220
What's the point if I can't play!

196
14:08.470 --> 14:09.780
All I can do is listen!

197
14:10.100 --> 14:10.700
I...

198
14:10.810 --> 14:11.700
I just...

199
14:11.880 --> 14:13.460
I just, ah!

200
14:22.960 --> 14:24.000
I can't move it...

201
14:25.060 --> 14:26.950
I can't even feel the pain anymore!

202
14:28.290 --> 14:29.700
My hand's useless.

203
14:29.940 --> 14:31.170
It's gonna be okay.

204
14:31.320 --> 14:33.050
I'm sure someday, somehow...

205
14:33.270 --> 14:34.390
Don't give up hope!

206
14:34.640 --> 14:36.050
Don't figure something now!

207
14:36.240 --> 14:38.050
But they came and told me to give up.

208
14:41.110 --> 14:42.800
They said I'll never play again.

209
14:44.490 --> 14:48.750
The doctor told me, he said the
current medicine can't help anymore.

210
14:49.370 --> 14:51.860
My hand is never gonna move right again.

211
14:52.540 --> 14:55.730
Unless magic and miracles suddenly become real.

212
14:56.220 --> 14:57.090
But they are!

213
14:58.320 --> 15:02.040
Miracles, magic, they are real!

214
15:24.560 --> 15:25.410
Huh?

215
15:25.710 --> 15:27.080
Is that Hitomi?

216
15:27.280 --> 15:28.470
Hey, Hitomi!

217
15:29.420 --> 15:31.020
I thought you were in a practice today.

218
15:31.440 --> 15:32.570
Where're you...huh?

219
15:38.520 --> 15:39.220
Hitomi!

220
15:39.440 --> 15:41.940
Hey, Hitomi come on!

221
15:43.230 --> 15:46.390
Ah, good evening, Madoka. How are you?

222
15:46.810 --> 15:48.640
Huh? What happened to you?

223
15:49.290 --> 15:51.340
Do you know where you are, where you're going?

224
15:51.700 --> 15:52.930
Where am I going?

225
15:54.420 --> 15:57.600
I'm going somewhere wonderful, that's where.

226
15:58.110 --> 15:59.240
Hitomi...

227
15:59.510 --> 16:00.780
Oh, yes.

228
16:01.090 --> 16:03.000
And you simply must come with!

229
16:03.390 --> 16:06.410
Yes. You'll see.
It'll be so wonderful!

230
16:36.680 --> 16:37.780
I'm worthless.

231
16:38.120 --> 16:38.800
It's true.

232
16:39.260 --> 16:40.060
A failure.

233
16:40.820 --> 16:45.160
I couldn't even keep this little factory's
door open long enough to turn a profit.

234
16:45.670 --> 16:48.800
There's no room for a person like me in today's world.

235
16:49.260 --> 16:51.240
I'm...obsolete.

236
17:01.790 --> 17:03.380
Pay attention, Madoka.

237
17:03.680 --> 17:06.360
These bottles look the same, but this one is dangerous.

238
17:06.540 --> 17:08.760
Never mix the two of these together, understand?

239
17:09.550 --> 17:11.990
We could all get really sick and die if you do.

240
17:12.350 --> 17:13.670
Do not mix them up.

241
17:14.610 --> 17:15.510
No, stop it!

242
17:15.810 --> 17:17.160
Don't do that!

243
17:19.870 --> 17:23.190
This is a sacred ceremony.
We can't have you interrupting it.

244
17:23.280 --> 17:25.290
But those chemicals're really dangerous!

245
17:25.500 --> 17:28.190
If you mix them together, everyone here could die!

246
17:28.920 --> 17:31.500
Yes, and we're all going to go on a wonderful journey,

247
17:31.750 --> 17:33.850
to a magnificent new world.

248
17:34.340 --> 17:37.280
Don't you see what an amazing opportunity this is?

249
17:37.580 --> 17:40.350
We can finally get rid of
these bodies that hold us back.

250
17:40.660 --> 17:44.320
Oh, Madoka, in a little while you'll understand too.

251
17:51.480 --> 17:52.530
Let go of me!

252
18:34.760 --> 18:35.620
What do I do?

253
18:36.050 --> 18:37.080
What do I do?

254
18:45.130 --> 18:45.950
No...

255
18:46.660 --> 18:47.430
Go away...

256
18:52.330 --> 18:52.880
No.

257
18:53.180 --> 18:54.520
Someone help me!

258
18:54.880 --> 18:55.870
Help me!

259
20:04.810 --> 20:06.020
Sayaka?!

260
20:21.600 --> 20:23.540
You're so going down!

261
20:40.580 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

262
20:42.510 --> 20:44.480
I guess I cut it too darn close, didn't I?

263
20:45.240 --> 20:46.390
Sayaka...

264
20:47.130 --> 20:48.190
Your clothes.

265
20:48.560 --> 20:50.480
Huh? Oh, hahaha.

266
20:50.650 --> 20:54.070
Well, uh, you could say I sort of had a change of heart.

267
20:55.950 --> 20:58.140
Don't worry. I'll be okay!

268
20:58.420 --> 21:00.950
I mean I did pretty good for
my first time out, didn't I?

269
21:01.360 --> 21:02.390
Yeah, but...

270
21:07.900 --> 21:09.040
How could you..?!

271
21:11.000 --> 21:11.760
Huh.

272
21:12.320 --> 21:14.470
You're late, Transfer Student.

273
21:42.660 --> 21:44.770
I didn't expect you to show up.

274
21:45.930 --> 21:49.150
I came all this way 'cause I heard old Mami bought it.

275
21:49.350 --> 21:51.570
So, why don't you tell me something?

276
21:52.340 --> 21:53.620
What's the deal, huh?

277
21:53.820 --> 21:55.480
This isn't anything like what you said.

278
21:55.780 --> 21:59.520
Sorry, but this territory has been
taken over by another magical girl.

279
21:59.810 --> 22:01.840
She made a contract with me a little while ago.

280
22:02.390 --> 22:03.390
What the hell?!

281
22:03.610 --> 22:04.790
That pisses me off!

282
22:05.280 --> 22:07.620
I mean, I couldn't live with myself

283
22:07.680 --> 22:11.020
if I just handed prime territory
like this over to some rookie.

284
22:11.600 --> 22:12.750
That'd be crazy.

285
22:13.200 --> 22:14.700
What are you going to do, Kyoko?

286
22:15.770 --> 22:16.750
Simple.

287
22:17.620 --> 22:18.570
I'll just...

288
22:19.270 --> 22:21.700
put her dumb rookie ass out of commission.

289
22:22.960 --> 22:24.190
Permanently.

290
23:56.550 --> 23:57.880
I'm excited about this.

291
23:58.170 --> 23:58.900
Seriously.

292
23:59.150 --> 24:02.920
From now on, I'll promise that
I - Magical Girl Sayaka

293
24:03.250 --> 24:06.280
- will do my best to protect
the peace of Mitakihara City!

294
24:06.730 --> 24:09.080
There's no way I'll ever regret it.

295
01:42.530 --> 01:46.700
<i>Now that I think about it,
I really didn't understand anything back then.</i>

296
01:47.620 --> 01:51.850
<i>What it meant to pray for a
miracle, or the price of one.</i>

297
04:31.260 --> 04:33.450
<i>Sayaka, I need to talk.</i>

298
04:33.860 --> 04:35.290
<i>Sorry, not now.</i>

299
04:35.930 --> 04:36.800
<i>We'll talk later.</i>

300
15:14.800 --> 15:19.830
<i>When I was talking with Homura,
it felt like we could be friends.</i>

301
15:20.560 --> 15:23.830
<i>I wonder why she and Mami didn't get along?</i>

302
15:34.630 --> 15:37.590
<i>Huh? It's like what that woman had on her neck!</i>

303
16:08.670 --> 16:09.660
<i>What should I do?</i>

304
16:10.840 --> 16:12.110
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

305
16:26.810 --> 16:28.590
<i>I have to call Homura.</i>

306
16:28.760 --> 16:30.280
<i>Oh, but I can't!</i>

307
16:30.540 --> 16:31.990
<i>I don't have her cell number.</i>

308
19:29.970 --> 19:31.460
<i>I wonder if this...</i>

309
19:32.190 --> 19:33.520
<i>is my punishment.</i>

310
19:34.590 --> 19:35.590
<i>For being...</i>

311
19:36.330 --> 19:37.580
<i>a coward...</i>

312
19:38.830 --> 19:39.890
<i>and a liar.</i>

313
19:41.350 --> 19:42.460
<i>I guess this...</i>

314
19:43.460 --> 19:44.960
<i>is what I deserve.</i>
