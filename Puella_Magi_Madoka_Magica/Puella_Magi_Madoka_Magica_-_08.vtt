00:18.940 --> 00:21.850
Shutting off the pain's pretty
easy once you know how to do it.

2
00:22.740 --> 00:24.980
This way I'll never lose another fight.

3
00:42.390 --> 00:43.400
You can have it.

4
00:43.650 --> 00:45.380
That's what you're here for, isn't it?

5
00:45.710 --> 00:46.570
Watch it.

6
00:47.590 --> 00:49.470
I don't wanna owe you anything.

7
00:49.940 --> 00:50.930
We're even now.

8
00:51.480 --> 00:52.470
Got it?

9
00:52.960 --> 00:54.430
Let's get out of here, Madoka.

10
00:56.330 --> 00:57.600
Sayaka...

11
01:07.430 --> 01:08.440
Ah...

12
01:09.410 --> 01:10.230
Sorry...

13
01:11.650 --> 01:13.430
I'm still a little tired...

14
01:14.540 --> 01:15.310
Take it easy.

15
01:15.720 --> 01:16.580
I got you.

16
01:24.200 --> 01:25.710
That idiot!

17
03:11.840 --> 03:13.070
Sayaka...

18
03:14.240 --> 03:16.290
You can't fight like that.

19
03:25.120 --> 03:27.190
You're lying if you say it doesn't hurt.

20
03:27.480 --> 03:29.080
It hurts just watching you.

21
03:29.460 --> 03:33.890
Just because you can't feel the pain,
doesn't mean it's okay to hurt yourself.

22
03:37.410 --> 03:39.700
I don't have the knack for it.

23
03:40.170 --> 03:42.150
[If] I don't fight like that, I can't win.

24
03:42.320 --> 03:46.280
Even if you fight like that and win every
battle, it's not good for you.

25
03:46.710 --> 03:47.780
Can't you see that?

26
03:48.560 --> 03:50.560
Then what is "good for me?"

27
03:50.560 --> 03:51.520
Ah..?

28
03:59.080 --> 04:01.160
I've been turned into a monster.

29
04:01.300 --> 04:03.530
How can anything ever be good for me again?

30
04:03.690 --> 04:04.620
Sayaka...

31
04:05.170 --> 04:07.010
All I can do now is kill witches.

32
04:07.440 --> 04:08.940
That's my new purpose in life.

33
04:09.320 --> 04:10.540
I'm useless otherwise.

34
04:11.040 --> 04:14.610
I'm just a walking corpse
pretending like I'm still alive.

35
04:14.980 --> 04:16.680
Who's gonna help me now?

36
04:17.130 --> 04:18.680
The way I am, who'd want to?

37
04:19.380 --> 04:20.730
Why you even think about it?

38
04:20.970 --> 04:22.090
But I wanna help.

39
04:22.260 --> 04:25.360
I just don't know what to do to make you happy again.

40
04:27.110 --> 04:29.100
Then why don't you fight for a change?

41
04:34.990 --> 04:36.830
Wanna know what Kyubey told me?

42
04:37.140 --> 04:39.400
You've got more potential than anyone.

43
04:39.710 --> 04:43.660
You could beat any witch [with] no problem
and you wouldn't even suffer like I do.

44
04:43.850 --> 04:44.720
But I...

45
04:46.410 --> 04:47.680
I just...

46
04:48.500 --> 04:53.050
If you really wanna help me, you should try
putting yourself in my shoes for a change.

47
04:53.920 --> 04:54.850
But you can't.

48
04:55.300 --> 04:56.280
Of course not.

49
04:57.770 --> 05:00.970
You won't even give up your
humanity out of pity for a friend!

50
05:01.210 --> 05:02.390
It's not that I want!

51
05:02.490 --> 05:03.370
It's just...

52
05:05.180 --> 05:07.240
You can do anything but you won't.

53
05:07.490 --> 05:10.360
You just sit there 'cause it's okay
if I'm the one who's suffering.

54
05:10.770 --> 05:11.970
Don't act like you care.

55
05:12.280 --> 05:13.620
It's obvious you don't.

56
05:14.750 --> 05:15.860
Sayaka, wait!

57
05:18.760 --> 05:20.000
Don't follow me.

58
05:20.470 --> 05:21.150
Uh...

59
05:36.600 --> 05:38.220
I'm so stupid...!

60
05:38.480 --> 05:40.120
How could I say those things..?

61
05:40.400 --> 05:42.150
I'm so hopelessly stupid...

62
05:58.040 --> 06:00.910
Walpurgisnacht is supposed to appear in this area.

63
06:03.470 --> 06:04.310
Oh, yeah?

64
06:04.440 --> 06:05.470
What makes you so sure?

65
06:05.700 --> 06:06.540
Statistics.

66
06:06.850 --> 06:07.560
Huh.

67
06:09.170 --> 06:12.090
I've never heard about Walpurgisnacht
showing up here before.

68
06:12.620 --> 06:16.020
You mind telling me where you
got these statistics of yours?

69
06:18.300 --> 06:19.360
Huh...

70
06:19.670 --> 06:23.160
Look, we don't have to trust each
other and be all BFF's or anything,

71
06:23.410 --> 06:26.620
but do you think you could maybe
give me an idea of what's going on?

72
06:26.800 --> 06:28.750
I was wondering the exact same thing,

73
06:29.480 --> 06:30.510
Homura Akemi.

74
06:31.890 --> 06:34.100
You've got some balls showing your face around here!

75
06:34.360 --> 06:35.430
Oh, my.

76
06:35.630 --> 06:37.840
Perhaps I'm not welcome here after all.

77
06:38.180 --> 06:39.850
And after coming all this way,

78
06:40.110 --> 06:42.950
just to give you some very important information.

79
06:43.540 --> 06:44.290
What?

80
06:44.450 --> 06:46.770
Sayaka Miki is deteriorating fast.

81
06:46.980 --> 06:49.160
And not only because she used too much magic,

82
06:49.400 --> 06:51.350
there's a curse growing inside her now.

83
06:51.710 --> 06:54.040
And whose fault do you think that is, huh?

84
06:54.190 --> 06:56.850
I don't doubt she'll be causing you quite a bit trouble,

85
06:57.180 --> 06:59.600
even before Walpurgisnacht arrives.

86
06:59.950 --> 07:01.560
You'd best be on your guard.

87
07:02.150 --> 07:03.630
What do you mean trouble?

88
07:03.740 --> 07:04.760
Come on, let's have it.

89
07:04.960 --> 07:07.490
You might wanna ask her about that instead of me.

90
07:07.880 --> 07:11.890
I'm sure you already know what
I'm talking about, Homura Akemi.

91
07:14.550 --> 07:15.640
I thought so.

92
07:16.260 --> 07:19.910
I'm curious, how did you learn
about all these interesting things?

93
07:20.370 --> 07:21.520
Enlighten me.

94
07:22.080 --> 07:24.100
I think I've heard enough from you today.

95
07:24.750 --> 07:25.520
Get out.

96
07:33.950 --> 07:34.730
Great.

97
07:34.850 --> 07:36.050
You're just gonna let him go?

98
07:36.310 --> 07:38.210
There's no point trying to kill that creature.

99
07:38.690 --> 07:39.620
Take my word.

100
07:40.450 --> 07:42.160
What's up with Sayaka Miki?

101
07:42.440 --> 07:45.210
What kind of trouble do you think
that fuzzball was talking about?

102
07:47.320 --> 07:48.570
Her Soul Gem is tainted.

103
07:48.990 --> 07:51.180
And if it's not purified soon,

104
07:51.350 --> 07:53.890
there won't be anything anyone can do to save her.

105
08:00.760 --> 08:04.840
Now, the auxiliary verb "must" means that
something or other has to be done,

106
08:05.160 --> 08:07.550
but "have to" has a slightly different vibe.

107
08:08.530 --> 08:09.230
For example...

108
08:09.320 --> 08:10.760
Why did I let her go?

109
08:11.360 --> 08:12.920
I should've gone after her.

110
08:24.900 --> 08:25.770
Wait...

111
08:25.970 --> 08:28.540
I don't think I've ever seen you
walking home this way before.

112
08:28.950 --> 08:29.940
How come?

113
08:30.470 --> 08:32.220
Did you just move or something?

114
08:32.700 --> 08:36.340
Actually, my house is in the exact opposite direction.

115
08:36.640 --> 08:38.580
Okay...

116
08:38.770 --> 08:40.840
Then, why are you walking this way?

117
08:42.900 --> 08:44.050
Kyosuke...

118
08:45.420 --> 08:47.630
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

119
08:48.760 --> 08:50.080
She hasn't come home?

120
08:50.620 --> 08:51.820
Since yesterday?

121
08:52.840 --> 08:53.480
Oh...

122
08:53.730 --> 08:56.110
Yes, um...

123
08:56.360 --> 08:57.190
I understand.

124
08:57.970 --> 08:58.900
Okay.

125
08:59.720 --> 09:00.780
Thank you very much.

126
09:11.830 --> 09:13.000
Sayaka...

127
09:13.590 --> 09:14.820
I've gotta find her!

128
09:44.080 --> 09:45.920
Ahhhhh!

129
10:12.500 --> 10:13.970
Why can't you understand?

130
10:14.190 --> 10:16.160
You don't have the luxury to fool around.

131
10:16.620 --> 10:18.160
You should only hunt witches.

132
10:19.150 --> 10:19.910
Shut up!

133
10:20.190 --> 10:21.530
I don't need your advice.

134
10:22.140 --> 10:23.930
Your Soul Gem is at its limit.

135
10:24.240 --> 10:26.210
You need to purify it now.

136
10:27.290 --> 10:28.240
Use this.

137
10:35.600 --> 10:36.440
What is this?

138
10:36.570 --> 10:37.670
What are you up to?

139
10:38.960 --> 10:39.920
Don't be stupid.

140
10:41.540 --> 10:43.510
You're in no position to question my help.

141
10:43.970 --> 10:46.190
Or, do you just hate the idea of it?

142
10:46.850 --> 10:50.000
I'm gonna be a different kind of magical girl.

143
10:50.300 --> 10:51.870
That's what I decided.

144
10:52.300 --> 10:55.970
I'm not gonna screw anyone over
or take anyone for granted.

145
10:56.180 --> 10:58.370
And I won't associate with anyone who does!

146
10:58.830 --> 11:00.520
I don't need anyone's thanks.

147
11:00.820 --> 11:04.690
I'll be the only magical girl around
who doesn't use her magic for herself.

148
11:05.290 --> 11:06.130
Well, then.

149
11:06.490 --> 11:07.570
You're going to die.

150
11:08.020 --> 11:08.810
So what?

151
11:09.080 --> 11:12.260
If I'm gonna die, it's gonna be
when I can't kill witches anymore.

152
11:12.830 --> 11:15.030
No one's gonna need me anyway, right?

153
11:16.070 --> 11:17.300
I'm okay with that.

154
11:19.870 --> 11:23.770
The world doesn't need a magical girl,
she can't even kill a witch.

155
11:25.890 --> 11:27.560
Why are you doing this to yourself?

156
11:27.790 --> 11:29.010
Why won't you trust me?

157
11:29.310 --> 11:31.090
Can you see I just wanna help you?

158
11:31.770 --> 11:33.560
Why don't I trust you?

159
11:33.960 --> 11:36.650
Maybe it's 'cause I can tell what you really are.

160
11:36.990 --> 11:38.880
Maybe I know you're lying.

161
11:39.430 --> 11:42.470
You look like someone who's given up on everything.

162
11:42.700 --> 11:45.260
When you talk, you use empty words.

163
11:45.510 --> 11:47.560
In fact, you're doing it now.

164
11:47.730 --> 11:51.320
You say you wanna help me,
but I know that's not what you're really thinking.

165
11:52.250 --> 11:53.680
You're not fooling anyone.

166
11:54.200 --> 11:54.930
Uh-uh.

167
11:56.050 --> 12:00.030
Do you realize that you're just
making Madoka suffer more and more?

168
12:00.450 --> 12:01.090
Madoka?

169
12:01.490 --> 12:02.870
This has nothing to do with her.

170
12:03.390 --> 12:04.120
You're wrong.

171
12:04.380 --> 12:06.420
Everything has to do with her.

172
12:14.250 --> 12:15.140
You're sharp.

173
12:15.730 --> 12:16.310
Yes.

174
12:16.420 --> 12:17.420
You're right about me.

175
12:17.810 --> 12:19.890
I don't give a damn if you live or die.

176
12:20.010 --> 12:20.860
I don't care.

177
12:21.020 --> 12:24.690
I just don't want Madoka to see you like
this, as you destroy yourself.

178
12:25.730 --> 12:28.950
If you don't let me help you now,
you're going to die, either way.

179
12:29.290 --> 12:32.550
You see, if you make her suffer anymore,

180
12:33.750 --> 12:34.930
then I will...

181
12:36.000 --> 12:37.080
kill you...

182
12:37.610 --> 12:40.710
right here right now, Sayaka Miki.

183
12:43.910 --> 12:44.470
Hurry!

184
12:44.580 --> 12:45.880
Go on! Get out of here!

185
12:57.640 --> 12:58.670
What are you, crazy?!

186
12:58.790 --> 13:00.770
What happened to saving her?
You remember that?!

187
13:01.040 --> 13:02.110
Let me go.

188
13:02.650 --> 13:03.790
Oh, I get it.

189
13:03.950 --> 13:05.510
If I keep holding onto you like this,

190
13:05.700 --> 13:08.170
you can't use that funky technique of yours, can ya?

191
13:11.030 --> 13:11.880
Ah!

192
13:23.420 --> 13:24.320
Dammit!

193
13:30.540 --> 13:34.140
No way, man, you can't let the
dumb slut make excuses like that.

194
13:34.300 --> 13:36.810
You gotta make her hand all her cash over.

195
13:37.320 --> 13:38.510
Dumb bitches.

196
13:38.640 --> 13:42.480
You only get their hands on some coins and
they blow it all on stupid shit for reals.

197
13:42.650 --> 13:43.860
Seriously, gee.

198
13:43.990 --> 13:45.740
Can't treat 'em like they got any brains.

199
13:45.850 --> 13:46.640
That's for sure.

200
13:46.900 --> 13:49.250
Treat 'em like the dumbass bitches they are.

201
13:49.430 --> 13:52.070
My hoe's so dumb, she freakin loves it like that.

202
13:52.200 --> 13:54.140
I just tell her, "I'll bust your shit!"

203
13:54.310 --> 13:55.370
She shuts right up!

204
13:56.390 --> 13:59.110
You let up on 'em and they're all like
"I wanna get married."

205
13:59.380 --> 14:00.570
You can't be soft, man.

206
14:00.700 --> 14:02.410
Can't be soft, heh.

207
14:02.790 --> 14:04.360
I'm all like, you think a shit-for-brains hoe

208
14:04.420 --> 14:06.490
like you's gonna be making it as much in ten years?

209
14:06.490 --> 14:08.810
That body ain't gonna last forever, you know!

210
14:09.200 --> 14:11.820
And then you dump 'em, and they get all "why me".

211
14:12.110 --> 14:15.690
You know, who's gonna dumping hoes, Sho, man, Sho.

212
14:15.770 --> 14:17.110
Now that motherfu...

213
14:17.610 --> 14:18.960
I wanna know more about your girl.

214
14:19.350 --> 14:20.170
What the...?

215
14:20.560 --> 14:23.250
I wanna know about the girl you
guys were just talking about.

216
14:23.640 --> 14:24.970
Tell me more about her.

217
14:26.910 --> 14:28.780
You're like in middle school, kid.

218
14:29.000 --> 14:30.090
You should be home in bed.

219
14:30.490 --> 14:35.530
Your girlfriend, I bet she loves you and tries
really hard to make you happy, doesn't she?

220
14:35.740 --> 14:37.470
I bet you know she does, don't you?

221
14:38.020 --> 14:41.150
And instead of saying thanks,
you sit there calling her a bitch.

222
14:41.560 --> 14:43.220
Then dump her when she gets old.

223
14:43.440 --> 14:44.790
Yo, you know this kid?

224
14:45.160 --> 14:45.960
No...

225
14:47.880 --> 14:50.540
Hey, is this world even worth protecting?

226
14:50.840 --> 14:53.070
What have I been fighting for all this time?

227
14:53.650 --> 14:54.500
Answer me,

228
14:54.970 --> 14:55.880
right now.

229
14:56.380 --> 14:57.330
Come one, tell me.

230
14:57.900 --> 14:58.930
Or else...

231
15:09.690 --> 15:11.910
Where are you, Sayaka?

232
15:18.810 --> 15:21.270
I bet you're upset with me too, aren't you?

233
15:22.900 --> 15:25.650
If I was, would you change Sayaka back?

234
15:26.960 --> 15:27.920
I can't.

235
15:28.160 --> 15:29.930
It's beyond my power to do so.

236
15:34.110 --> 15:34.860
Hey.

237
15:35.400 --> 15:39.660
Remember when you told me I could become a
really powerful magical girl if I wanted?

238
15:40.240 --> 15:41.230
Was that for real?

239
15:41.640 --> 15:44.280
Really powerful doesn't even begin to describe it.

240
15:44.520 --> 15:46.880
Your power would be almost limitless.

241
15:46.910 --> 15:49.260
You'd be the strongest magical girl in this world.

242
15:49.590 --> 15:54.700
If I made a contract, would Sayaka still
have chosen to become a magical girl?

243
15:55.030 --> 15:57.230
Sayaka was responsible for her own wish.

244
15:57.460 --> 16:00.170
You had absolutely nothing to do with her decision.

245
16:04.500 --> 16:06.380
Why am I the powerful one?

246
16:06.710 --> 16:07.710
I have no idea.

247
16:07.930 --> 16:10.770
The truth is your potential is on a scale that,

248
16:11.000 --> 16:13.390
theoretically anyway, shouldn't even be possible.

249
16:14.370 --> 16:16.830
I want someone to come explain it as much as you do.

250
16:17.550 --> 16:18.450
Really?

251
16:18.740 --> 16:21.590
If you release your power,
you could do more than miracles.

252
16:21.900 --> 16:25.020
You could very well twist the
fabric of the universe itself.

253
16:25.800 --> 16:28.990
Why you've been selected to have
this power over anyone else,

254
16:29.350 --> 16:31.260
I can't even begin to guess the reason.

255
16:32.510 --> 16:32.960
You know...

256
16:33.280 --> 16:36.830
I never thought there was anything
all that special about me.

257
16:37.690 --> 16:41.250
I always thought, I'd just stumble through life,

258
16:41.550 --> 16:43.570
not really amounting to anything much,

259
16:43.900 --> 16:47.670
never being able to help anyone
or be of any use at all.

260
16:48.180 --> 16:51.100
It was really frustrating and I felt all alone.

261
16:51.420 --> 16:54.940
But I figured there wasn't anything I could do about it.

262
16:56.430 --> 16:58.690
But the reality is different, isn't it?

263
16:59.730 --> 17:01.740
Madoka, if you wished it,

264
17:01.750 --> 17:05.550
you could even become the god of this world.

265
17:06.130 --> 17:07.240
If that's true,

266
17:07.540 --> 17:11.250
would I be able to do stuff
that even you can't do, Kyubey?

267
17:11.630 --> 17:12.370
Like what?

268
17:12.580 --> 17:15.000
Like if I went ahead and made a contract with you,

269
17:15.220 --> 17:17.190
could I turn Sayaka back to normal?

270
17:17.650 --> 17:19.470
That would be like child's play for you.

271
17:19.810 --> 17:22.640
Would that be worth trading your soul for?

272
17:23.290 --> 17:24.250
Would you like to?

273
17:24.640 --> 17:25.270
Yes.

274
17:25.430 --> 17:26.470
For Sayaka, I would.

275
17:26.870 --> 17:27.800
I'll do it.

276
17:28.080 --> 17:29.260
I wanna be...

277
17:29.720 --> 17:30.900
a magical...

278
17:35.730 --> 17:36.720
Uh..?!

279
17:48.160 --> 17:49.700
What did you do?

280
17:49.940 --> 17:51.410
You didn't have to kill him!

281
17:51.790 --> 17:52.860
You idiot.

282
17:53.310 --> 17:54.550
Why do you do that?

283
17:54.830 --> 17:57.440
Why do you always sacrifice yourself like that?

284
17:59.750 --> 18:00.600
Huh?

285
18:00.960 --> 18:03.260
Calling yourself useless, and meaningless...

286
18:03.720 --> 18:05.930
Stop treating yourself like you don't matter!

287
18:06.190 --> 18:08.910
Why don't you ever think about
all the people who love you?!

288
18:09.280 --> 18:10.620
Stop being such a fool!

289
18:11.000 --> 18:13.200
There are so many people who would be sad if you died.

290
18:13.450 --> 18:15.170
Why can't you understand that?!

291
18:15.500 --> 18:18.130
What about the people who are
trying hard to protect you?!

292
18:24.080 --> 18:25.120
Homura...

293
18:26.650 --> 18:27.580
Ah...

294
18:28.010 --> 18:29.970
I get the feeling we've done this before...

295
18:30.950 --> 18:32.020
I-Is that true?

296
18:32.400 --> 18:33.800
Have the two of us met before?

297
18:34.160 --> 18:36.500
I-I can't...

298
18:39.590 --> 18:40.550
Sorry...

299
18:43.840 --> 18:45.960
I have to go find Sayaka now.

300
18:46.810 --> 18:47.770
Wait,

301
18:48.340 --> 18:50.230
Sayaka Miki is...

302
18:50.840 --> 18:51.680
I'm sorry.

303
18:53.990 --> 18:54.970
Wait!

304
18:55.780 --> 18:56.830
Madoka!

305
19:02.920 --> 19:05.210
You knew there was no point in doing that.

306
19:05.430 --> 19:07.070
You don't learn, do you?

307
19:08.730 --> 19:10.670
I have plenty of spares, you know.

308
19:10.940 --> 19:13.270
But don't make me use them up for no reason.

309
19:13.500 --> 19:14.640
It's such a waste.

310
19:29.610 --> 19:32.020
You know, that's the second time you've killed me.

311
19:32.470 --> 19:35.200
But this time, you showed me what your technique is.

312
19:35.500 --> 19:38.020
That was time manipulation, wasn't it?

313
19:40.780 --> 19:41.870
I thought so.

314
19:42.300 --> 19:44.990
I've suspected for a while,
but I wasn't sure.

315
19:45.310 --> 19:47.200
You're not from this timeline, are you?

316
19:48.860 --> 19:52.740
I know what you really are,
and I know what you're planning.

317
19:53.010 --> 19:54.020
Uh-huh.

318
19:54.200 --> 19:57.120
That's why you've been trying so hard to spoil my plans.

319
19:57.480 --> 20:00.640
Do you wanna change Madoka Kaname's fate that badly?

320
20:00.880 --> 20:01.570
I do.

321
20:02.510 --> 20:04.960
And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to stop you,

322
20:05.700 --> 20:06.690
Kyubey.

323
20:07.920 --> 20:09.240
Or should I say,

324
20:09.500 --> 20:10.970
"Incubator?"

325
20:21.260 --> 20:22.850
Finally, I found ya.

326
20:25.650 --> 20:28.730
So how much longer are you gonna
do this stubborn thing, huh?

327
20:29.860 --> 20:32.910
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.

328
20:33.220 --> 20:34.250
Seriously?

329
20:34.690 --> 20:36.230
Doesn't sound like you at all.

330
20:36.610 --> 20:37.720
Hmm...

331
20:38.030 --> 20:39.090
Yeah, you're right.

332
20:39.860 --> 20:41.560
I guess I just don't care anymore.

333
20:41.980 --> 20:44.970
I can't remember...what I thought was so important,

334
20:45.300 --> 20:47.150
or what was worth protecting, you know.

335
20:47.610 --> 20:50.640
It's all blank now, doesn't make sense anymore.

336
20:51.190 --> 20:52.040
Hey, come on.

337
20:55.430 --> 20:56.250
Ah..!?

338
20:56.350 --> 20:59.900
Balance means good and bad have
to zero themselves out, right?

339
21:00.270 --> 21:01.380
That's what you said...

340
21:01.800 --> 21:03.030
or something like it.

341
21:03.690 --> 21:05.720
I think I understand what you mean now.

342
21:06.870 --> 21:10.120
The good thing is,
I did save a few people.

343
21:10.810 --> 21:12.240
But the bad thing is,

344
21:12.610 --> 21:13.560
I got angrier,

345
21:13.720 --> 21:15.770
and my heart filled up with envy and hate.

346
21:16.120 --> 21:19.010
It got so bad.
I even hurt my best friend.

347
21:19.270 --> 21:20.010
Sayaka!

348
21:20.120 --> 21:20.910
Your Soul Gem!

349
21:21.360 --> 21:26.190
For all the happiness you wish for someone,
someone else gets cursed with equal misery.

350
21:26.530 --> 21:30.540
That's how it works for magical girls,
and that's how it is for me.

351
21:36.420 --> 21:37.860
I was stupid...

352
21:38.850 --> 21:39.940
so stupid.

353
22:03.300 --> 22:05.720
Sayakaaaa!!

354
22:11.130 --> 22:15.810
On this planet, you call females who
have yet to become adults "girls."

355
22:16.140 --> 22:19.790
It makes sense then,
that since you'll eventually become witches,

356
22:20.030 --> 22:22.720
you should be called "magical girls."

357
23:56.130 --> 23:58.680
I know this sounds kinda crazy but...

358
23:58.970 --> 24:02.620
The thing is, we don't know she can be saved yet or not.

359
24:02.840 --> 24:04.320
So there's still hope for that,

360
24:04.430 --> 24:05.570
I'm not gonna give up.

361
24:06.660 --> 24:08.560
I'd never allow that to happen.

362
14:16.500 --> 14:17.400
Hey, you.
