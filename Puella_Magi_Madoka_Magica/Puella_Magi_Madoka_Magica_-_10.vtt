1
00:02.930 --> 00:05.350
Okay, go ahead and introduce yourself.

2
00:06.080 --> 00:07.040
U-Um...

3
00:07.330 --> 00:10.090
M-my name is H-Homura Akemi.

4
00:10.530 --> 00:11.160
And, uh...

5
00:11.380 --> 00:12.340
I, uh...

6
00:12.740 --> 00:13.850
It's really nice...

7
00:14.220 --> 00:16.250
I mean, I'm pleased to meet you...

8
00:18.770 --> 00:22.210
Miss Akemi was in the hospital for
a while due to a heart condition.

9
00:22.370 --> 00:24.130
Since she's been away from school for so long,

10
00:24.300 --> 00:26.080
she might need some help adjusting.

11
00:26.250 --> 00:27.760
So, let's all help her out, okay?

12
00:29.940 --> 00:33.440
So, what school did you go to before coming to this one?

13
00:33.570 --> 00:35.020
Were you in any cool clubs?

14
00:35.190 --> 00:36.780
How about sports?
Were you in a team?

15
00:36.900 --> 00:38.710
Wow, your hair's like so super long!

16
00:38.900 --> 00:40.890
That must take a lot of time to braid, huh?

17
00:41.120 --> 00:43.070
I, uh...
um...

18
00:43.340 --> 00:45.090
I don't...
I'm not...

19
00:45.190 --> 00:45.940
Hmm...

20
00:45.940 --> 00:46.640
Miss Akemi.

21
00:46.640 --> 00:47.170
Uh?

22
00:47.520 --> 00:49.680
Didn't you need to go the nurse's office right now?

23
00:49.970 --> 00:51.100
Do you know where it is?

24
00:51.370 --> 00:52.070
Huh?

25
00:52.230 --> 00:53.360
Um, no...

26
00:53.560 --> 00:54.960
I can take you there if you want.

27
00:55.160 --> 00:57.310
I'm the Nurse's Aide for our classroom.

28
00:57.660 --> 00:58.720
Sorry, guys.

29
00:58.920 --> 01:00.200
But every break time,

30
01:00.310 --> 01:03.210
Miss Akemi is supposed to go to the
nurse's office for her medicine.

31
01:03.520 --> 01:04.300
Really?

32
01:04.440 --> 01:05.410
Sorry about that.

33
01:05.650 --> 01:06.910
We didn't mean to keep you.

34
01:07.200 --> 01:09.830
Yeah, we can talk some more when you get back, okay?

35
01:10.670 --> 01:11.800
Hah...

36
01:13.020 --> 01:14.040
Don't mind them.

37
01:14.810 --> 01:16.320
They're harmless, I swear.

38
01:16.610 --> 01:20.320
They're all just excited because we don't
usually get many transfer students here.

39
01:20.490 --> 01:21.770
Oh, um...

40
01:22.060 --> 01:23.890
Thank you very much for that.

41
01:24.120 --> 01:26.260
Hey, you don't have to be so nervous around me.

42
01:26.540 --> 01:28.240
I mean, we're classmates now.

43
01:28.520 --> 01:30.270
Oh, I'm Madoka Kaname.

44
01:30.530 --> 01:32.060
But you can call me Madoka.

45
01:32.130 --> 01:33.050
Huh? But...

46
01:33.370 --> 01:34.770
Isn't that too...

47
01:34.980 --> 01:35.900
It's fine.

48
01:36.000 --> 01:39.650
Anyway, would you mind if I went
ahead and called you Homura?

49
01:40.570 --> 01:41.560
Well, I...

50
01:41.700 --> 01:42.700
I, uh...

51
01:42.840 --> 01:45.450
I don't really get called by my first name very much.

52
01:45.800 --> 01:46.690
It's...

53
01:46.840 --> 01:48.050
kind of weird name.

54
01:48.420 --> 01:49.180
What?

55
01:49.360 --> 01:50.580
It's not weird at all!

56
01:50.810 --> 01:54.460
It means "flame" like you flare
up passionately or something!

57
01:54.610 --> 01:56.330
I think it's cool.

58
01:57.100 --> 01:58.820
I'm not really like that though...

59
01:58.910 --> 01:59.700
Oh...

60
02:00.060 --> 02:02.140
Come on, how can you say that?

61
02:02.390 --> 02:04.550
If you were blessed with such an awesome name,

62
02:04.680 --> 02:07.570
then you have to make your mission to be just as cool!

63
02:08.090 --> 02:09.810
Um....

64
02:13.310 --> 02:15.750
All right, why don't you try solving this one?

65
02:21.540 --> 02:22.860
Um....

66
02:24.090 --> 02:25.160
You've been out sick.

67
02:25.390 --> 02:28.180
Ask one of your friends for
their notes and try to catch up.

68
02:29.920 --> 02:31.110
Can you believe it?

69
02:31.200 --> 02:33.340
She got dizzy just from doing warm-ups.

70
02:33.450 --> 02:35.680
Oh, she has been stuck in the bed for half a year.

71
02:35.810 --> 02:36.700
So, go figure.

72
02:37.190 --> 02:38.700
Ha...

73
03:18.350 --> 03:18.920
Ah!?

74
03:24.580 --> 03:26.560
Um?
Where am I?

75
03:27.250 --> 03:27.980
Oh, no...

76
03:34.120 --> 03:35.650
Ah, what's that?

77
03:35.930 --> 03:36.960
What's going on?

78
03:39.730 --> 03:40.480
No!

79
03:40.630 --> 03:41.390
Ah!

80
03:56.390 --> 03:58.340
That was a close one, wasn't it?

81
03:58.660 --> 04:01.350
Don't worry. You're safe, Homura.

82
04:02.640 --> 04:04.130
What are you doing here?

83
04:04.300 --> 04:05.950
Why? They're magical girls.

84
04:06.000 --> 04:08.290
They're girls who hunt witches.

85
04:08.570 --> 04:10.300
Oops. Our secret's out.

86
04:10.840 --> 04:12.850
Just don't tell anyone else in class, okay?

87
04:28.500 --> 04:29.600
Miss Kaname...

88
04:29.820 --> 04:32.740
I-I was wondering,
do you fight those things all the time?

89
04:32.980 --> 04:33.820
Hmm...

90
04:33.930 --> 04:34.920
Not all the time.

91
04:35.170 --> 04:37.580
Mami is pretty much the veteran around here.

92
04:37.720 --> 04:38.850
You wanna know the truth,

93
04:39.020 --> 04:41.520
I already made a contract with Kyubey about a week ago.

94
04:41.880 --> 04:43.770
You handled yourself very well today.

95
04:43.910 --> 04:45.970
It was the best performance I've seen yet...

96
04:46.180 --> 04:47.100
for a rookie.

97
04:48.060 --> 04:49.340
But doesn't it bother you?

98
04:49.750 --> 04:50.770
I mean...

99
04:50.850 --> 04:52.490
don't you get scared?

100
04:52.600 --> 04:54.340
Oh, sure bothered by it.

101
04:54.590 --> 04:56.340
And yeah, that's kind a scary.

102
04:56.870 --> 04:58.160
But when you look at it,

103
04:58.300 --> 05:00.890
the more witches we take out,
the more people we save.

104
05:01.080 --> 05:02.760
So, it's worth the effort, isn't it?

105
05:03.060 --> 05:03.760
Mm-hm.

106
05:04.040 --> 05:04.910
Uh...

107
05:05.170 --> 05:07.410
It won't be long until Walpurgisnacht gets here.

108
05:07.700 --> 05:11.310
So, the goal is to get Madoka fully-trained
as a magical girl before then.

109
05:17.630 --> 05:19.480
Well, I'd better get going.

110
05:20.070 --> 05:21.120
But...

111
05:21.490 --> 05:22.510
Miss Tomoe...

112
05:22.840 --> 05:25.030
That thing killed her...

113
05:25.690 --> 05:26.560
I know.

114
05:26.890 --> 05:29.540
But someone has to stop Walpurgisnacht.

115
05:29.670 --> 05:31.440
And I'm the only one left who can.

116
05:31.820 --> 05:32.600
No!

117
05:32.890 --> 05:35.360
You can't beat it by yourself, it's too strong!

118
05:35.610 --> 05:37.820
It'll kill you too, Miss Kaname!

119
05:37.940 --> 05:40.370
Even so, I have to protect everyone.

120
05:41.320 --> 05:42.490
It's my job.

121
05:42.840 --> 05:44.660
I'm a magical girl.

122
05:45.780 --> 05:46.930
Please...

123
05:47.120 --> 05:48.130
You can run away...

124
05:48.740 --> 05:49.990
I mean...

125
05:50.720 --> 05:51.760
this is hopeless!

126
05:52.200 --> 05:55.030
No one will blame you if you did, Miss Kaname.

127
05:56.770 --> 05:57.810
Homura...

128
05:58.250 --> 05:59.090
It's okay.

129
05:59.380 --> 06:01.560
I'm glad I got to become friends with you.

130
06:02.200 --> 06:05.390
Saving you from that witch
was the best thing I ever did.

131
06:06.280 --> 06:08.390
And I'm always gonna be proud of that.

132
06:09.460 --> 06:10.350
You see?

133
06:10.710 --> 06:14.220
That's why, in the end,
I'm glad I became a magical girl.

134
06:14.990 --> 06:16.040
I really am.

135
06:17.310 --> 06:18.460
Miss Kaname...

136
06:19.130 --> 06:21.600
Good-bye, Homura.

137
06:22.730 --> 06:23.710
Take care.

138
06:23.710 --> 06:24.530
Wait.

139
06:24.700 --> 06:25.470
No!

140
06:26.150 --> 06:27.280
Don't go!

141
06:28.010 --> 06:30.220
Miss Kaname!!

142
06:35.500 --> 06:36.390
Why...?

143
06:37.110 --> 06:40.040
You knew you were gonna get killed all along...

144
06:40.520 --> 06:42.530
It wasn't worth saving me...

145
06:43.250 --> 06:45.560
if you're not alive...

146
06:46.920 --> 06:48.460
I want you back...

147
06:49.170 --> 06:52.560
Is that really what you want, Homura Akemi?

148
06:53.480 --> 06:56.630
Would you trade your soul to
have a wish like that come true?

149
06:57.590 --> 06:59.450
If there is something you want badly and

150
06:59.550 --> 07:02.250
you're willing to accept the destiny battling witches,

151
07:02.550 --> 07:04.490
then I can help you get what you want.

152
07:07.480 --> 07:11.920
If I make a contract with you,
would you really grant me any wish?

153
07:12.260 --> 07:13.250
Absolutely.

154
07:13.470 --> 07:15.160
You have more than enough potential.

155
07:16.230 --> 07:21.220
So tell me, what is the one wish you'd have
that will make your Soul Gem shine?

156
07:21.920 --> 07:22.910
I wish...

157
07:31.850 --> 07:35.350
I wish, I can meet Miss Kaname all over again.

158
07:36.140 --> 07:38.550
But this time, instead of her protecting me,

159
07:38.820 --> 07:41.250
I wanna be strong enough to protect her!

160
07:44.850 --> 07:47.700
Ugh...

161
07:54.410 --> 07:55.800
The contract is complete.

162
07:56.250 --> 07:58.220
Your wish has overcome entropy.

163
07:58.950 --> 07:59.990
Go now...

164
08:00.450 --> 08:03.560
Go and unleash your new magical power!

165
08:26.360 --> 08:27.130
Ah!

166
08:29.830 --> 08:31.130
Where am I?

167
08:32.940 --> 08:33.750
I...

168
08:34.380 --> 08:36.790
I'm still in the hospital?

169
08:37.720 --> 08:38.610
Uh...

170
08:40.570 --> 08:41.560
Ah!

171
08:42.570 --> 08:44.180
It wasn't a dream!

172
08:47.830 --> 08:48.750
Ahem.

173
08:48.960 --> 08:51.210
Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?

174
08:51.980 --> 08:53.120
I'm Homura Akemi.

175
08:53.420 --> 08:54.760
I'm very pleased to meet you!

176
08:56.090 --> 08:59.490
Okay, people, Miss Akemi's been
in the hospital for a wh...

177
09:00.430 --> 09:01.600
Ah...

178
09:01.930 --> 09:02.730
Miss Kaname!

179
09:02.980 --> 09:05.020
I've become a magical girl just like you!

180
09:05.390 --> 09:07.220
We're gonna work together from now on!

181
09:07.550 --> 09:09.510
Uh... um...

182
09:10.300 --> 09:11.370
Umm...

183
09:14.610 --> 09:16.410
Okay, here I go!

184
09:25.220 --> 09:26.760
Yahh!!!

185
09:40.380 --> 09:41.400
Well, Mami.

186
09:41.640 --> 09:42.720
What do you think?

187
09:43.070 --> 09:44.040
Hmm...

188
09:44.340 --> 09:45.650
She can stop time.

189
09:46.060 --> 09:47.760
That's pretty amazing,

190
09:48.000 --> 09:50.710
but she still has to figure out how to use it in battle.

191
09:51.720 --> 09:53.340
Huh, I know...

192
10:09.200 --> 10:10.890
Ahhh...

193
10:21.570 --> 10:22.270
Mami!

194
10:22.460 --> 10:23.230
Your turn!

195
10:23.740 --> 10:24.800
I'm on it!

196
10:25.270 --> 10:26.520
Ha!

197
10:33.480 --> 10:35.150
Homura, go for it!

198
10:35.920 --> 10:36.760
Okay!

199
11:05.440 --> 11:06.390
Huh?

200
11:06.450 --> 11:07.790
Uh, did I do it?

201
11:08.250 --> 11:09.360
Look you did it!

202
11:11.510 --> 11:12.510
You did well.

203
11:12.720 --> 11:14.230
You were amazing, Homura!

204
11:20.470 --> 11:23.140
Urgh...

205
11:23.240 --> 11:24.170
What's wrong?

206
11:24.480 --> 11:26.830
Miss Kaname, say something!

207
11:28.020 --> 11:28.920
Why is so...?

208
11:29.190 --> 11:31.560
Ugh!

209
11:32.850 --> 11:33.730
Ahhh!

210
11:34.700 --> 11:35.690
Ahh...

211
11:41.790 --> 11:42.650
Oh, no...

212
11:45.560 --> 11:46.890
But, why...?

213
11:47.660 --> 11:48.810
How could this...

214
11:49.090 --> 11:50.090
happen?

215
11:54.420 --> 11:55.430
Ah!

216
11:59.910 --> 12:01.080
I have to tell everyone!

217
12:02.180 --> 12:03.930
We're all being tricked by Kyubey!

218
12:04.870 --> 12:05.930
Okay, look.

219
12:06.170 --> 12:08.200
Why would Kyubey do something like that?

220
12:08.540 --> 12:09.890
What'd he get out of it?

221
12:10.230 --> 12:11.170
W-Well...

222
12:12.160 --> 12:14.770
I bet you're just saying that
so we'll turn against each other.

223
12:15.020 --> 12:16.200
Oh, wait a sec.

224
12:16.380 --> 12:19.480
Are you and Kyoko chick working together?
Is that what's going on?

225
12:19.800 --> 12:20.920
No, I'm not!

226
12:21.160 --> 12:22.080
Sayaka, wait.

227
12:22.330 --> 12:24.060
Stop trying to pick a fight with her.

228
12:25.090 --> 12:26.210
Fine. Whatever...

229
12:26.380 --> 12:28.760
Do what you want, but I'm not teaming up with that girl.

230
12:29.180 --> 12:32.690
You and Mami use long-range weapons,
so it's no biggie for you guys.

231
12:32.940 --> 12:36.590
But when I'm fighting, I don't like
when explosion's going off in my face.

232
12:36.960 --> 12:39.140
She comes this close to blowing me up every time.

233
12:39.520 --> 12:40.870
She has a point there.

234
12:41.240 --> 12:43.950
Are there any weapons you can use besides bombs?

235
12:44.220 --> 12:46.330
Um...

236
12:46.620 --> 12:49.240
Okay, I'll think of something.

237
13:13.120 --> 13:13.880
Dammit!

238
13:14.100 --> 13:15.470
What are you?

239
13:15.810 --> 13:17.320
What have you done to Sayaka?

240
13:17.820 --> 13:19.060
Sayaka, please stop!

241
13:19.410 --> 13:21.250
Try to remember, please!

242
13:21.490 --> 13:24.590
I know you never really wanted to hurt anyone.

243
13:44.150 --> 13:45.070
Sorry...

244
13:45.620 --> 13:46.520
Miss Miki.

245
14:01.240 --> 14:02.190
Sayaka...

246
14:03.100 --> 14:04.020
Dammit!

247
14:04.220 --> 14:05.570
How could this happen?

248
14:06.080 --> 14:07.120
It's awful...

249
14:08.190 --> 14:10.200
This isn't right... It's horrible!

250
14:11.470 --> 14:12.800
Aw...

251
14:18.110 --> 14:19.110
Miss Tomoe?

252
14:21.110 --> 14:23.060
If Soul Gems give birth to witches...

253
14:24.030 --> 14:26.370
then we have no choice but to die!

254
14:26.480 --> 14:27.470
Both me...

255
14:27.670 --> 14:28.720
and you...!

256
14:29.000 --> 14:29.850
Stop it!

257
14:31.670 --> 14:32.930
Aw...

258
14:39.340 --> 14:40.870
I don't want this...

259
14:41.580 --> 14:44.010
I can't take it any more...

260
14:49.600 --> 14:50.560
It's okay.

261
14:51.890 --> 14:53.030
We can finish this.

262
14:53.600 --> 14:56.250
The two of us can destroy Walpurgisnacht on our own!

263
15:00.250 --> 15:01.380
Mm...

264
15:01.620 --> 15:02.570
Mm.

265
15:11.400 --> 15:12.470
This is it...

266
15:13.130 --> 15:15.110
It's over for us too...

267
15:15.490 --> 15:16.470
Mm...

268
15:17.000 --> 15:18.680
Do you have any Grief Seeds?

269
15:23.280 --> 15:24.130
...'Kay.

270
15:25.060 --> 15:26.510
I have got an idea.

271
15:27.320 --> 15:29.520
How about we both become witches...

272
15:30.250 --> 15:33.550
and we can tear this rotten world together?

273
15:34.660 --> 15:37.980
Until there is no more evil,
no more sadness,

274
15:38.540 --> 15:40.020
until there's nothing left.

275
15:40.730 --> 15:44.080
We'll break, and smash,
and pound it into dust.

276
15:45.230 --> 15:46.550
What if we did that?

277
15:46.960 --> 15:48.970
Wouldn't that be great?

278
15:53.210 --> 15:54.190
Ah!

279
15:55.870 --> 15:57.440
Sorry, I lied.

280
15:58.080 --> 16:00.870
I guess I still have one left.

281
16:01.640 --> 16:03.200
You should've used it!

282
16:03.380 --> 16:04.730
It's better this way.

283
16:05.140 --> 16:08.530
I want you to do something that I couldn't do.

284
16:09.860 --> 16:13.220
You can go back in time, right, Homura?

285
16:13.950 --> 16:16.910
You can go back and change everything...

286
16:17.000 --> 16:19.740
so that we don't end up like this...

287
16:19.770 --> 16:21.140
Okay?

288
16:21.410 --> 16:25.290
Then save me from being stupid, from getting tricked.

289
16:25.920 --> 16:28.150
Don't let Kyubey fool me again.

290
16:28.610 --> 16:30.170
I swear I'll save you!

291
16:30.490 --> 16:33.080
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you safe!

292
16:33.440 --> 16:35.870
I'll come back again and again and again!

293
16:36.390 --> 16:37.330
I'll save you!

294
16:37.460 --> 16:38.540
I swear!

295
16:40.790 --> 16:42.050
Thank you...

296
16:42.640 --> 16:44.520
Urgh!

297
16:49.430 --> 16:50.300
Can I ask...

298
16:50.790 --> 16:52.130
one more thing?

299
16:55.550 --> 16:58.800
Don't let...me turn into a witch...

300
16:59.400 --> 17:02.970
There's awful...
horrible things in this world...

301
17:03.440 --> 17:04.830
I know that now...

302
17:05.910 --> 17:09.410
that there's a lot of things worth protecting, too...

303
17:11.490 --> 17:15.710
Finally, you called me by my first name.

304
17:16.320 --> 17:19.120
I'm so... happy...

305
17:26.610 --> 17:28.520
Ahh!

306
17:52.810 --> 17:53.330
Huh?

307
17:53.800 --> 17:55.260
Wh-who's there?

308
17:55.910 --> 17:57.200
Madoka...

309
17:57.420 --> 18:01.310
If someone comes and says they'll
grant any wish you want, it isn't true.

310
18:02.040 --> 18:03.860
Don't believe anything they say!

311
18:04.270 --> 18:06.170
Um... But I...

312
19:09.010 --> 19:09.970
That's horrible...

313
19:10.190 --> 19:11.110
You can't help it.

314
19:11.730 --> 19:13.610
One person can't handle this alone.

315
19:13.920 --> 19:16.890
No, this isn't right, it's too much for her...

316
19:22.200 --> 19:23.540
No, Madoka!

317
19:23.690 --> 19:26.470
Don't listen to anything it says!

318
19:28.360 --> 19:30.010
If she gives up, it's over.

319
19:30.620 --> 19:33.790
But, you have the power to change this destiny.

320
19:34.150 --> 19:39.100
All this tragedy, all this destruction,
you can change it, if you want.

321
19:39.560 --> 19:41.970
The power to do so lies within you.

322
19:43.340 --> 19:44.430
I can change it?

323
19:44.980 --> 19:46.470
It's trying to trick you!

324
19:46.830 --> 19:48.350
Don't listen to it!

325
19:48.720 --> 19:51.130
Even someone like me can do something to help?

326
19:51.990 --> 19:54.180
Can I really change how this ends?

327
19:54.420 --> 19:55.480
Of course, you can.

328
19:56.070 --> 19:58.350
Just make a contract with me,

329
19:58.630 --> 20:01.380
and become a magical girl!

330
20:06.220 --> 20:09.830
Noooo!

331
20:15.760 --> 20:19.890
When Madoka transformed,
that was really amazing, wasn't it?

332
20:21.340 --> 20:26.000
I never had any doubt she'd become the
most powerful magical girl in the world.

333
20:26.830 --> 20:31.120
But I never dreamed she'd take
down Walpurgisnacht with one shot.

334
20:32.420 --> 20:34.090
Did you know what would happen...

335
20:34.830 --> 20:35.900
afterwards?

336
20:36.750 --> 20:39.280
Her fate was bound to happen sooner or later.

337
20:39.650 --> 20:44.750
She was the strongest of all magical girls,
and she destroyed her greatest enemy.

338
20:45.230 --> 20:48.660
It's only natural she'd turn into
the wickedest witch of them all.

339
20:49.170 --> 20:50.580
And in her current state,

340
20:50.820 --> 20:55.170
I'm estimating it'll take her no more
than ten days to destroy the planet.

341
20:56.330 --> 20:59.100
Oh, well, it's humanity's problem now.

342
20:59.820 --> 21:03.170
We pretty much filled our quota
and have more than enough energy.

343
21:06.960 --> 21:07.960
Uh...

344
21:09.040 --> 21:10.460
Aren't you going to fight her?

345
21:11.590 --> 21:12.370
No.

346
21:13.370 --> 21:15.050
My fight is somewhere else.

347
21:15.610 --> 21:16.340
Uh...

348
21:17.370 --> 21:18.470
Homura Akemi...

349
21:19.170 --> 21:20.070
You're...!

350
21:44.990 --> 21:45.690
Ah!

351
22:05.140 --> 22:06.360
Homura...?

352
22:06.420 --> 22:07.310
Ah!

353
23:56.240 --> 23:58.350
You spent all that time with them.

354
23:58.610 --> 24:00.440
Didn't you ever feel anything?

355
24:00.910 --> 24:03.280
Didn't you ever try to understand?

356
24:03.530 --> 24:05.890
Couldn't you see how much pain they were in?

357
24:06.230 --> 24:09.060
The only thing I have left to guide me.

358
02:22.600 --> 02:23.820
Oh, that's right.

359
04:47.010 --> 04:47.880
Huh...?

360
12:11.050 --> 12:11.940
Uh-huh?

361
16:00.420 --> 16:01.260
But why?!

362
17:09.020 --> 17:10.050
Madoka!

363
02:41.320 --> 02:43.970
<i>You have to make your mission to be just as cool!</i>

364
02:45.390 --> 02:46.610
<i>No way...</i>

365
02:47.020 --> 02:47.690
<i>Not me.</i>

366
02:47.940 --> 02:49.310
<i>I can't do anything right...</i>

367
02:50.570 --> 02:54.320
<i>I just embarrass myself and cause trouble for everyone.</i>

368
02:56.090 --> 02:57.090
<i>Why?</i>

369
02:57.880 --> 02:58.690
<i>Is this...</i>

370
02:59.080 --> 03:00.160
<i>the way...</i>

371
03:00.680 --> 03:02.690
<i>I'll always be?</i>

372
03:03.970 --> 03:06.760
<i>Maybe it would be better if you just died.</i>

373
03:07.430 --> 03:09.260
<i>Maybe it would be better...</i>

374
03:09.660 --> 03:10.580
<i>That's right.</i>

375
03:10.840 --> 03:12.660
<i>You should just die...</i>

376
03:13.470 --> 03:14.940
<i>I should just...</i>

377
03:15.630 --> 03:16.560
<i>die...</i>

378
17:39.480 --> 17:41.340
<i>No one will believe me about the future.</i>

379
17:43.640 --> 17:46.150
<i>No one will accept the truth about the future.</i>

380
17:49.100 --> 17:50.690
<i>I know what to do now.</i>

381
18:15.020 --> 18:16.840
<i>I won't rely on anyone anymore!</i>

382
18:18.720 --> 18:20.480
<i>I don't care if no one understands.</i>

383
18:29.530 --> 18:31.000
<i>I won't let Madoka fight.</i>

384
18:35.090 --> 18:37.700
<i>I'll destroy every last witch by myself if I have to.</i>

385
18:42.370 --> 18:43.580
<i>And this time...</i>

386
18:44.100 --> 18:45.900
<i>I will defeat Walpurgisnacht,</i>

387
18:46.160 --> 18:47.170
<i>once and for all!</i>

388
21:23.770 --> 21:24.990
<i>I'll do it over...</i>

389
21:25.490 --> 21:27.440
<i>no matter how many times it takes.</i>

390
21:33.940 --> 21:35.880
<i>I'll relive it over and over again.</i>

391
21:36.500 --> 21:38.070
<i>I will find the way out.</i>

392
21:39.240 --> 21:40.290
<i>The one path,</i>

393
21:40.750 --> 21:43.020
<i>that'll save you from this destiny of despair.</i>

394
21:58.090 --> 21:59.280
<i>Madoka...</i>

395
21:59.740 --> 22:02.850
<i>My one and my only friend.</i>

396
22:14.230 --> 22:15.360
<i>I don't care...</i>

397
22:16.190 --> 22:17.880
<i>because if it's for you,</i>

398
22:18.570 --> 22:21.340
<i>I'll stay trapped in this endless maze,</i>

399
22:21.870 --> 22:24.060
<i>forever!</i>
