00:00.200 --> 00:00.200


2
00:18.380 --> 00:19.490
Oh, hi there!

3
00:19.990 --> 00:20.660
Mm.

4
00:25.390 --> 00:26.200
It's for you.

5
00:28.640 --> 00:32.390
Wow, thanks a lot for getting me this.

6
00:32.880 --> 00:35.560
You're like these amazing experts to finding rare CDs.

7
00:36.590 --> 00:37.360
Nah.

8
00:37.490 --> 00:38.820
I guess I'm just lucky, is all.

9
00:40.100 --> 00:42.580
This soloist's interpretations are pretty awesome.

10
00:42.960 --> 00:44.320
Here, wanna check them out?

11
00:44.560 --> 00:46.730
O-oh, sure if you don't mind.

12
00:47.970 --> 00:51.880
I wish I could hook it up to a speaker and play it
loud, nurses would kill me though.

13
00:00.200 --> 00:00.200
-- OP --

14
03:01.800 --> 03:03.050
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

15
03:14.360 --> 03:17.450
Wow, Mami, you're so unbelievably cool!

16
03:18.380 --> 03:19.990
This isn't supposed to be fun.

17
03:21.650 --> 03:23.380
What we're doing is very dangerous.

18
03:23.760 --> 03:24.960
Don't forget that, okay?

19
03:25.250 --> 03:26.020
Roger that!

20
03:28.190 --> 03:30.590
How come a Grief Seed didn't pop out this time?

21
03:31.000 --> 03:32.220
It wasn't a witch.

22
03:32.490 --> 03:34.790
It's a familiar acting without its master.

23
03:35.050 --> 03:36.390
They don't carry Grief Seeds.

24
03:36.840 --> 03:38.500
Oh, so that wasn't a witch.

25
03:38.760 --> 03:41.430
It seems ashamed to have to fight and not get anything.

26
03:41.820 --> 03:44.160
We can't really let familiars do as they want.

27
03:44.420 --> 03:48.020
If we did, they'd eventually become the
same as the witch they split off from.

28
03:49.180 --> 03:50.590
Well, shall we go now?

29
03:51.920 --> 03:54.470
Have either of you decided what to wish for yet?

30
03:54.860 --> 03:55.640
Uh-uh.

31
03:55.940 --> 03:57.090
How about you?

32
03:57.380 --> 03:58.140
Hmm...

33
03:58.330 --> 04:00.450
That doesn't surprise me.

34
04:00.730 --> 04:02.640
It's hard to think when you're under pressure.

35
04:03.080 --> 04:05.530
Maybe it would help if you told us what you wished for.

36
04:07.570 --> 04:08.960
I didn't mean to be nosey.

37
04:09.190 --> 04:10.800
It's fine if you don't wanna say.

38
04:12.530 --> 04:13.990
For me, it was different.

39
04:25.190 --> 04:28.040
I didn't have the luxury of thinking about it first.

40
04:29.840 --> 04:31.560
It's not that I regret my decision.

41
04:32.300 --> 04:33.640
I'm alive after all.

42
04:34.020 --> 04:36.890
And I think the life I have
now is better than being dead.

43
04:37.990 --> 04:40.930
But if you have the chance to think
really hard about what you want,

44
04:41.030 --> 04:43.540
you should take as much time as you need.

45
04:44.720 --> 04:46.330
That wasn't an option for me.

46
04:47.310 --> 04:48.900
Um...hey, Mami.

47
04:49.310 --> 04:54.020
I was wondering...if you make a wish,
does it have to be for yourself?

48
04:54.450 --> 04:55.090
Huh?

49
04:55.210 --> 04:58.140
Let's say that, and this is just an example, okay?

50
04:58.620 --> 05:01.630
Say there was someone who was
having a way worse time than I was,

51
05:01.820 --> 05:04.450
would it be bad if I used my wish to help him out?

52
05:04.700 --> 05:06.020
Are you talking about Kyosuke?

53
05:06.550 --> 05:07.420
It's an example!

54
05:07.540 --> 05:08.830
I'm not talking about anyone!

55
05:09.400 --> 05:10.800
You can wish for whatever you want.

56
05:11.050 --> 05:14.240
There's no rule that says you have
to be the one to benefit from it.

57
05:14.550 --> 05:16.340
It wouldn't be the first time that's happened.

58
05:16.660 --> 05:19.490
Actually that might not be the best idea.

59
05:20.680 --> 05:26.140
If you use your wish to grant someone else's, you
should be careful you know exactly why you are doing it.

60
05:26.550 --> 05:29.080
Are you really doing it for someone else's benefit?

61
05:30.180 --> 05:33.850
Or the opposite, you're doing it for
that person's ever lasting gratitude.

62
05:34.210 --> 05:35.110
Mami.

63
05:35.320 --> 05:38.250
The motive behind the wish is
what matters most, you know?

64
05:39.080 --> 05:40.350
That's kind of harsh.

65
05:40.570 --> 05:41.830
I was just asking.

66
05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
I am sorry.

67
05:43.570 --> 05:45.810
But I had to say it now before it was too late.

68
05:46.020 --> 05:51.180
If you're not 100% sure why you're doing
it, you'll most definitely regret it later.

69
05:56.230 --> 05:57.270
I guess you're right.

70
05:57.950 --> 06:00.190
Maybe I was being a little naïve there.

71
06:00.600 --> 06:01.350
Sorry.

72
06:01.350 --> 06:02.040
That's okay.

73
06:02.970 --> 06:04.870
It's a hard decision to make, isn't it?

74
06:05.820 --> 06:07.680
It's not something you need to rush into.

75
06:08.700 --> 06:11.730
As far as I'm concerned,
the sooner you decide, the better.

76
06:12.130 --> 06:13.900
Oh, please, haven't you heard?

77
06:14.270 --> 06:15.810
Girls don't like pushy boys.

78
06:21.670 --> 06:24.130
Deciding what to wish for is harder than I thought.

79
06:24.500 --> 06:27.190
Even though I really want you to, I can't rush you.

80
06:27.540 --> 06:29.700
Suggesting a wish is also against the rules.

81
06:29.990 --> 06:33.360
Would wishing to be a magical girl be a bad thing?

82
06:34.030 --> 06:37.000
Madoka, are you just looking to become powerful?

83
06:37.500 --> 06:38.210
Oh, no.

84
06:38.400 --> 06:39.650
I don't really care about that.

85
06:40.100 --> 06:40.960
Although...

86
06:41.460 --> 06:43.190
maybe I do a little.

87
06:43.820 --> 06:45.490
I mean I'm not very smart.

88
06:45.770 --> 06:46.970
I don't have any talents.

89
06:47.390 --> 06:51.510
But if I could become a person who's
as wonderful and as cool as Mami is,

90
06:51.690 --> 06:54.490
then that something, I know for
sure, will make me happy.

91
06:54.710 --> 06:56.030
If you became a magical girl,

92
06:56.090 --> 06:58.480
there's no doubt you'd be much more powerful than Mami.

93
06:58.780 --> 06:59.350
Huh?

94
06:59.860 --> 07:00.540
It's true!

95
07:00.680 --> 07:03.520
Although a lot depends on the kind of wish you make.

96
07:04.220 --> 07:05.250
Let me put it this way.

97
07:05.700 --> 07:09.210
I can't even begin to guess how big
the Soul Gem you'd create would be.

98
07:09.500 --> 07:12.500
I've never met a girl with the
enormous potential you have.

99
07:13.810 --> 07:15.960
Oh, come on. You can't be serious.

100
07:16.220 --> 07:17.370
You're joking, right?

101
07:17.540 --> 07:18.410
No.

102
07:19.320 --> 07:20.820
Madoka? Are you awake?

103
07:21.090 --> 07:22.480
Uh-huh. What's up, Dad?

104
07:26.240 --> 07:27.350
Oh, god...

105
07:27.670 --> 07:28.840
Oh no, not again.

106
07:29.620 --> 07:30.470
Come on, Mom.

107
07:32.480 --> 07:34.290
W-water...

108
07:38.500 --> 07:40.850
...stupid balding old coot...!

109
07:40.850 --> 07:46.100
If he wants a damn drink so badly,
he can damn well pour it himself, damn it!

110
07:46.120 --> 07:46.890
Thanks a lot.

111
07:46.890 --> 07:48.490
You wanna have some hot chocolate with me?

112
07:48.830 --> 07:50.270
Uh-huh. Sounds good!

113
07:51.530 --> 07:54.530
Have you ever wondered why Mom loves to work so much.

114
07:54.750 --> 07:59.310
I mean, it wasn't really her dream
to work for that company or anything.

115
07:59.590 --> 08:00.280
What was it?

116
08:00.390 --> 08:01.140
Hmm...

117
08:01.320 --> 08:03.330
It's not so much about her loving to work.

118
08:03.700 --> 08:05.340
She just likes doing her best.

119
08:05.810 --> 08:06.450
Huh?

120
08:06.600 --> 08:10.000
Sure the hours are long and she's
under a lot of stress most of the time,

121
08:10.170 --> 08:12.870
but she loves the challenge she gets by overcoming it.

122
08:13.040 --> 08:15.630
To her, nothing beats its feeling of satisfaction.

123
08:16.280 --> 08:17.070
Hmm...

124
08:17.670 --> 08:21.660
You see, working at that company might
not necessarily have been her dream,

125
08:22.020 --> 08:25.560
but the way your mom's living her life
is actually kinda perfect for her.

126
08:25.880 --> 08:28.630
A person can achieve their
dreams that way too, you know.

127
08:29.830 --> 08:32.190
You mean the way she lives her life was her dream?

128
08:32.630 --> 08:35.440
I bet there's people out there who'd
say it's not that big of a deal.

129
08:35.860 --> 08:36.710
But you know what?

130
08:36.920 --> 08:38.840
That's the thing I really love about your mom.

131
08:39.350 --> 08:41.300
I respect the way she lives her life.

132
08:41.730 --> 08:42.910
I think she's amazing.

133
08:44.790 --> 08:45.640
Mm.

134
08:58.160 --> 08:59.140
Don't you even care?

135
09:00.190 --> 09:03.420
You do know you're leading innocent
people into danger, don't you?

136
09:04.750 --> 09:06.170
What are you talking about?

137
09:06.370 --> 09:07.360
Kyubey chose them.

138
09:07.680 --> 09:08.900
They're a part of this now.

139
09:10.080 --> 09:13.200
You're steering them into becoming magical girls.

140
09:13.920 --> 09:15.540
And I guess you don't like that.

141
09:16.180 --> 09:16.750
No.

142
09:17.260 --> 09:19.900
Especially, since Madoka Kaname's involved.

143
09:20.260 --> 09:21.070
Uh-huh.

144
09:22.350 --> 09:23.080
I see.

145
09:23.390 --> 09:26.430
You've noticed it too, have you?
Her incredible potential?

146
09:27.240 --> 09:28.150
I won't allow it.

147
09:28.390 --> 09:29.930
She won't become like us.

148
09:30.530 --> 09:33.290
Afraid of someone stronger
coming along to challenge you?

149
09:33.610 --> 09:35.780
That kind of thinking's only for losers.

150
09:39.130 --> 09:40.200
I don't wanna fight.

151
09:40.320 --> 09:41.580
But you leave me no choice.

152
09:42.470 --> 09:45.310
Then just make sure you and
I never see each other again.

153
09:45.820 --> 09:47.660
We are through talking after tonight.

154
09:47.900 --> 09:50.790
Next time, you can bet we'll have it out.

155
10:02.730 --> 10:04.590
Hey. Sorry for the wait.

156
10:04.760 --> 10:06.160
What's wrong? Is he okay?

157
10:06.630 --> 10:07.770
Wouldn't they let you see him?

158
10:07.850 --> 10:10.320
I guess he didn't want visitors today or something.

159
10:10.930 --> 10:12.450
And I came all this way.

160
10:12.670 --> 10:13.780
Talk about rude!

161
10:18.360 --> 10:19.720
Hey, what are you looking at?

162
10:19.920 --> 10:20.550
Over there.

163
10:20.830 --> 10:21.730
Can't you see it?

164
10:24.540 --> 10:25.620
It's a Grief Seed!

165
10:25.900 --> 10:27.100
It's about to hatch!

166
10:27.980 --> 10:28.570
Oh, no!

167
10:28.770 --> 10:29.750
Why is it here?

168
10:30.200 --> 10:30.960
This is bad.

169
10:31.160 --> 10:32.330
We have to get out of here!

170
10:32.810 --> 10:34.690
A Labyrinth is about to open up!

171
10:35.000 --> 10:37.080
You mean one of those mazes?

172
10:38.660 --> 10:41.050
Madoka, do you have Mami's number on you?

173
10:41.760 --> 10:42.680
Uh-uh.

174
10:43.190 --> 10:44.160
What do we do?

175
10:44.890 --> 10:45.400
I got it.

176
10:45.670 --> 10:47.390
Go find Mami and bring her back here.

177
10:47.610 --> 10:49.350
I'm gonna stay and keep an eye on it.

178
10:49.780 --> 10:50.580
You can't!

179
10:50.720 --> 10:51.540
It's too dangerous!

180
10:51.830 --> 10:54.700
Besides, we still have time before the witch hatches.

181
10:54.900 --> 10:57.720
But once the labyrinth pulls you in,
you won't be able to get out again.

182
10:58.170 --> 11:00.310
Mami might not get back in time to save you.

183
11:00.640 --> 11:03.730
But if the labyrinth opens up,
how will we know where the Grief Seed is?

184
11:03.840 --> 11:04.820
We'll lose track of it.

185
11:06.330 --> 11:08.000
I can't let that happen.

186
11:08.540 --> 11:09.410
Not here anyway.

187
11:13.270 --> 11:15.000
Madoka, you go on ahead.

188
11:15.340 --> 11:16.700
I'll stay here with Sayaka.

189
11:17.450 --> 11:18.290
Huh?

190
11:18.430 --> 11:21.520
If we're not here,
Mami can use telepathy to track my position.

191
11:21.760 --> 11:25.430
If the labyrinth opens,
Sayaka and I can follow the Grief Seed inside.

192
11:25.610 --> 11:28.770
When Mami gets here,
I can guide her down the shortest route to it.

193
11:29.240 --> 11:30.840
Thanks a lot, Kyubey.

194
11:31.270 --> 11:34.800
Okay, I'll go get Mami here as fast as I can!

195
11:59.300 --> 12:00.720
Are you scared, Sayaka?

196
12:00.990 --> 12:02.780
Oh, yeah... of course...

197
12:03.690 --> 12:05.720
All you have to do is make a wish.

198
12:05.910 --> 12:09.370
If you do, I can turn you into a
magical girl right here and now.

199
12:10.740 --> 12:11.440
I know.

200
12:12.160 --> 12:13.730
If things get bad, I just might.

201
12:14.500 --> 12:16.070
I'm okay for now.

202
12:16.840 --> 12:19.200
But that's an important decision for me to make.

203
12:19.960 --> 12:23.260
And if I can help it,
I wanna make sure I'm doing the right thing.

204
12:29.970 --> 12:30.920
There it is.

205
13:10.570 --> 13:12.170
Thank goodness, we made it.

206
13:12.460 --> 13:13.870
I'm a little angry though.

207
13:14.060 --> 13:15.660
Sayaka's taking a huge risk.

208
13:15.950 --> 13:18.750
But in this case, it was a good call on her part.

209
13:19.080 --> 13:22.190
This way, we don't have to
worry about the witch getting...

210
13:22.520 --> 13:23.140
Huh?

211
13:23.580 --> 13:24.410
Ah!

212
13:24.520 --> 13:27.560
I thought I told you, I didn't wanna see you again.

213
13:28.040 --> 13:29.870
Like it or not, I'm hunting this prey.

214
13:30.100 --> 13:31.680
You should leave immediately.

215
13:32.040 --> 13:33.470
Look, we're not going anywhere.

216
13:33.630 --> 13:35.920
Kyubey and Sayaka are inside waiting for us.

217
13:36.230 --> 13:38.600
Then I'll make sure they both get out safely.

218
13:38.790 --> 13:40.840
Do you honestly think I trust you?

219
13:46.560 --> 13:47.160
You...

220
13:47.510 --> 13:48.390
idiot!

221
13:48.920 --> 13:50.400
We don't have time for this!

222
13:50.720 --> 13:53.060
I don't wanna hurt you, but you give me no choice.

223
13:53.250 --> 13:55.440
Don't struggle, they'll only get tighter.

224
13:55.700 --> 13:56.640
Listen to me,

225
13:56.860 --> 13:59.010
I swear this witch is not like the others!

226
13:59.410 --> 14:01.280
Be a good girl and I'll release you,

227
14:01.760 --> 14:03.380
after I finish up here.

228
14:04.240 --> 14:05.490
Okay then, shall we go?

229
14:06.850 --> 14:07.500
Yeah.

230
14:08.190 --> 14:08.980
No, don't!

231
14:34.930 --> 14:36.010
Ugh...

232
14:36.930 --> 14:37.920
Mami...

233
14:38.410 --> 14:39.100
I, uh...

234
14:39.560 --> 14:40.130
Yes?

235
14:40.650 --> 14:44.320
I've been thinking really hard about
all the different wishes I can make.

236
14:44.790 --> 14:46.220
Do you have a favorite?

237
14:46.420 --> 14:47.040
Yes.

238
14:47.680 --> 14:48.680
But...

239
14:48.960 --> 14:49.780
um...

240
14:50.110 --> 14:53.390
You're probably gonna think it's
naïve and get upset with me.

241
14:53.730 --> 14:54.970
Let's find out.

242
14:55.280 --> 14:56.030
What's the wish?

243
14:56.320 --> 14:59.140
Well, there's nothing special about me.

244
14:59.510 --> 15:02.520
I've never been good at school,
and I don't have any talents.

245
15:03.440 --> 15:06.540
I'm scared this is the way my life is gonna stay.

246
15:07.100 --> 15:10.720
All is asking for help and not being
able to help when people need it.

247
15:11.260 --> 15:12.990
I can't stand thinking about it.

248
15:13.720 --> 15:14.430
Uh...

249
15:18.300 --> 15:19.850
But then I met you, Mami.

250
15:20.130 --> 15:23.990
And you showed me what it's like to
stand up for people and really help them.

251
15:25.290 --> 15:26.360
And then...

252
15:26.630 --> 15:29.240
When I found out that I might
be able to do the same thing,

253
15:30.650 --> 15:33.170
I don't think I've ever been happier in my life.

254
15:34.720 --> 15:35.860
And that's my wish.

255
15:36.450 --> 15:40.260
'cause if I can become a magical girl,
that would be a dream-come-true for me.

256
15:41.690 --> 15:43.350
I might not be good at anything,

257
15:43.470 --> 15:47.040
but if I can help people out like you
then I can be proud of the way I live.

258
15:47.260 --> 15:49.520
That's the best thing I could wish for.

259
15:50.860 --> 15:51.900
It won't be easy.

260
15:52.360 --> 15:53.400
You will get hurt.

261
15:53.680 --> 15:56.450
You won't have time to go on dates
or have fun with your friends.

262
15:56.960 --> 15:57.610
I know.

263
15:57.820 --> 16:02.170
But after seeing how you keep doing your
best, I really look up to you, Mami.

264
16:04.340 --> 16:05.360
I don't deserve it.

265
16:05.780 --> 16:07.370
You need a better role model.

266
16:07.870 --> 16:08.330
Uh..?

267
16:08.840 --> 16:10.380
I just pretend to be cool.

268
16:11.150 --> 16:13.850
When I'm scared or hurt, there's no one I can talk to.

269
16:14.400 --> 16:17.170
All I can do is cry on my own.

270
16:17.780 --> 16:18.810
It's not fun...

271
16:19.090 --> 16:20.630
being a magical girl.

272
16:23.110 --> 16:24.270
I hear you, Mami.

273
16:24.460 --> 16:26.000
But you're not alone anymore!

274
16:27.810 --> 16:28.600
You're right.

275
16:29.140 --> 16:29.990
I'm not alone.

276
16:34.950 --> 16:39.090
I found someone who's willing to stay
and fight by my side from now on!

277
16:40.730 --> 16:42.340
Will you really stay with me?

278
16:42.680 --> 16:43.500
Yes.

279
16:43.640 --> 16:45.040
If someone like me will do.

280
16:46.110 --> 16:47.510
Oh, look at this.

281
16:47.840 --> 16:51.450
It isn't the sort of behavior you'd
expect from a role model, is it?

282
16:52.050 --> 16:54.060
I'm not very good at this sort of thing, am I?

283
16:54.440 --> 16:55.420
Mami...

284
16:56.580 --> 16:58.620
Anyway, make sure you know what you want.

285
16:58.730 --> 17:00.950
A chance like this doesn't come around too often.

286
17:01.260 --> 17:02.130
Yeah, I know.

287
17:02.380 --> 17:03.960
It's a once-in-a-life thing!

288
17:04.310 --> 17:08.860
It is a contract after all, so you might as
well try to get something out of the deal.

289
17:09.200 --> 17:13.300
You could wish to be a billionaire,
or you could wish for the perfect boyfriend.

290
17:13.550 --> 17:14.790
Yeah, I know but...

291
17:15.430 --> 17:16.890
Okay, how about this?

292
17:17.040 --> 17:20.870
If you can't decide on something to wish
for by the time I finish off this witch,

293
17:21.040 --> 17:21.980
we'll have a feast!

294
17:22.290 --> 17:24.320
And you can ask Kyubey for a fabulous cake!

295
17:24.680 --> 17:25.220
Huh?

296
17:25.370 --> 17:26.240
Seriously?!

297
17:26.700 --> 17:27.320
Yes.

298
17:27.370 --> 17:30.250
You could ask for the biggest
and most extravagant cake ever.

299
17:30.550 --> 17:31.530
Ah...

300
17:31.660 --> 17:33.300
Then we can throw a party for everyone.

301
17:33.420 --> 17:37.820
A celebration to announce the two
of us becoming a magical girl duo!

302
17:37.840 --> 17:38.570
But I...

303
17:38.700 --> 17:40.400
I can't do something like that for a cake!

304
17:40.910 --> 17:42.660
Then decide on something you want.

305
17:43.070 --> 17:43.940
A cake...

306
17:52.530 --> 17:53.460
Okay! I'm on it!

307
17:54.020 --> 17:56.880
Today's a special day, so I'll make short work of it.

308
17:57.530 --> 17:58.810
Wah. But...

309
18:58.540 --> 18:59.420
Sorry I'm late!

310
18:59.520 --> 19:01.460
Phew, thank god you made it.

311
19:01.870 --> 19:03.230
Be careful.

312
19:03.650 --> 19:04.400
It's coming!

313
19:16.560 --> 19:18.100
Sorry for the interruption,

314
19:18.550 --> 19:19.860
but this won't take long!

315
19:22.190 --> 19:22.770
Gotcha!

316
19:31.840 --> 19:32.620
Yeah!

317
19:37.690 --> 19:40.210
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

318
20:00.440 --> 20:01.320
Oh, no...

319
20:08.380 --> 20:08.980
Hurry!

320
20:09.090 --> 20:10.880
Make a contract with me before it's too late!

321
20:11.480 --> 20:12.120
Madoka!

322
20:12.350 --> 20:13.070
Sayaka!

323
20:16.800 --> 20:17.640
Wish for something!

324
20:17.930 --> 20:18.500
Anything!

325
20:18.700 --> 20:19.310
Hurry!

326
20:19.560 --> 20:20.900
That won't be necessary.

327
20:25.810 --> 20:26.900
This one is mine.

328
20:27.460 --> 20:28.130
I'll kill it.

329
20:34.910 --> 20:35.810
Ah!

330
21:18.920 --> 21:21.670
A second later and you most certainly would be dead.

331
21:28.940 --> 21:30.610
Never forget what happened here.

332
21:31.070 --> 21:33.690
This is what it means to be a magical girl.

333
21:51.010 --> 21:51.840
Give it back.

334
21:51.630 --> 21:52.460
Hm?

335
21:54.410 --> 21:55.330
Give it back!

336
21:55.900 --> 21:56.510
It's hers.

337
21:57.580 --> 21:58.860
It's Mami's...

338
21:59.140 --> 22:00.490
It belongs to her!

339
22:00.800 --> 22:01.890
You can't have it!

340
22:02.000 --> 22:03.330
It belongs to Mami!

341
22:04.240 --> 22:04.990
You're right.

342
22:05.170 --> 22:07.430
But this can only belong to a magical girl.

343
22:07.640 --> 22:10.350
Therefore, neither of you has any right to touch it.

344
23:55.700 --> 23:56.490
Mami...

345
23:56.750 --> 23:58.520
really was the nicest person.

346
23:59.580 --> 24:02.130
But in order for us to understand what it takes,

347
24:02.400 --> 24:04.440
the kind of courage it takes to fight,

348
24:04.800 --> 24:05.740
she can't...

349
24:07.320 --> 24:09.160
Miracles and magic are real.

350
07:17.650 --> 07:18.470
Hm?

351
12:38.260 --> 12:39.540
<i>What's happening, Kyubey?</i>

352
12:40.130 --> 12:40.910
<i>We're okay.</i>

353
12:41.210 --> 12:42.800
<i>The witch hasn't hatched just yet.</i>

354
12:43.480 --> 12:44.650
<i>Are you okay, Sayaka?</i>

355
12:45.150 --> 12:46.120
<i>Heck yeah!</i>

356
12:46.290 --> 12:47.960
<i>I'm so bored I'm about to fall asleep.</i>

357
12:48.290 --> 12:51.010
<i>I wouldn't advise using large amounts of magic.</i>

358
12:51.280 --> 12:52.670
<i>You might disturb the egg.</i>

359
12:53.190 --> 12:54.220
<i>You don't have to hurry.</i>

360
12:54.580 --> 12:56.120
<i>Just come as quietly as you can.</i>

361
12:56.090 --> 12:56.850
<i>Got it.</i>

362
17:44.940 --> 17:45.670
<i>Mami!</i>

363
17:47.770 --> 17:49.130
<i>The Grief Seed started moving!</i>

364
17:49.460 --> 17:50.740
<i>It's about to hatch!</i>

365
17:51.050 --> 17:51.590
<i>Hurry!</i>

366
18:32.600 --> 18:33.590
<i>I feel so light.</i>

367
18:34.600 --> 18:37.380
<i>This is the first time I've
felt this happy during battle!</i>

368
18:40.730 --> 18:42.520
<i>I'm not afraid of anything anymore.</i>

369
18:47.550 --> 18:50.070
<i>Because, I'm not alone anymore.</i>
