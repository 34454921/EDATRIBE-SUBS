00:00.240 --> 00:00.240


2
01:28.990 --> 01:29.960
That's horrible...

3
01:30.260 --> 01:31.020
You can't help it.

4
01:31.650 --> 01:33.390
One person can't handle this alone.

5
01:33.980 --> 01:36.050
But she knew that and came here anyway.

6
01:40.810 --> 01:43.710
No, this isn't right, it's too much for her...

7
01:55.180 --> 01:56.830
If she gives up, it's over.

8
01:59.330 --> 02:02.390
But, you have the power to change this destiny.

9
02:07.480 --> 02:12.520
All this tragedy, all this destruction,
you can change it, if you want.

10
02:13.110 --> 02:15.200
The power to do so lies within you.

11
02:18.280 --> 02:19.350
I can change it?

12
02:25.130 --> 02:27.670
Even someone like me can do something to help?

13
02:28.410 --> 02:30.980
Can I really change how this ends?

14
02:31.000 --> 02:31.980
Of course, you can.

15
02:32.530 --> 02:36.300
Just make a contract with me, and become a Magical Girl!

16
02:54.030 --> 02:55.950
That was a crazy dream...

17
00:00.240 --> 00:00.240
&lt;OP&gt;

18
04:32.980 --> 04:34.170
Good morning, Dad.

19
04:34.640 --> 04:36.030
Oh, good morning, Madoka.

20
04:36.460 --> 04:37.490
Mom up yet?

21
04:37.670 --> 04:38.860
Tatsuya's waking her up.

22
04:39.040 --> 04:40.360
He might need some help, though.

23
04:40.630 --> 04:41.350
Okay.

24
04:44.800 --> 04:46.530
Mama, mama!

25
04:46.850 --> 04:49.570
Wake up, wake up!

26
04:49.810 --> 04:51.120
C'mon, mama!

27
04:51.390 --> 04:53.690
Mama, mama!

28
04:58.850 --> 05:00.390
Rise and shine!!

29
05:00.550 --> 05:03.830
Urghhhhhhhh!!

30
05:04.590 --> 05:05.710
......What the...?

31
05:05.120 --> 05:07.240
Mama woke up, yay!

32
05:11.700 --> 05:13.440
What's happening in your world?

33
05:14.000 --> 05:16.730
Well, Hitomi got another love letter.

34
05:17.230 --> 05:18.590
It's the second one this month.

35
05:19.200 --> 05:22.390
Huh, if he can't say to her face, he's not worth it.

36
05:26.100 --> 05:27.640
How's Kazuko doing?

37
05:27.820 --> 05:29.610
I think her new boyfriend's working out.

38
05:29.820 --> 05:32.520
She can't seem to talk about
anything else during homeroom.

39
05:32.770 --> 05:36.000
This week's their three months
anniversary, so I guess that's the record.

40
05:36.110 --> 05:37.840
Oh I hope they can make it.

41
05:38.080 --> 05:40.530
They're at a critical stage in their relationship.

42
05:42.520 --> 05:43.430
They are?

43
05:47.640 --> 05:51.210
If it's not the real thing,
this is usually when it starts to fall apart.

44
05:51.700 --> 05:54.830
But if they made it this far,
they should be okay for another year.

45
05:55.660 --> 05:56.780
Oh...

46
06:04.280 --> 06:05.840
I look fabulous.

47
06:06.290 --> 06:08.070
I wonder which ribbon I should wear.

48
06:09.740 --> 06:10.620
Really?

49
06:10.750 --> 06:11.830
It's not too flashy?

50
06:12.000 --> 06:13.970
There's no such thing as too flashy, hon.

51
06:14.150 --> 06:16.630
A woman can't afford to get
teased 'cause she looks sloppy.

52
06:24.290 --> 06:26.060
Hah, perfect!

53
06:26.230 --> 06:29.030
Your secret admirers are gonna get all wobbly and knees.

54
06:29.230 --> 06:30.850
I don't have secret admirers.

55
06:30.960 --> 06:32.910
But you should dress and behave like you do.

56
06:33.160 --> 06:35.610
That's the secret every pretty girl should know.

57
06:36.880 --> 06:37.900
Hehe..

58
06:39.490 --> 06:41.540
Ah...

59
06:43.290 --> 06:44.540
Uh-oh!

60
06:45.270 --> 06:46.780
Yay, safe!

61
06:46.920 --> 06:48.990
Now be good, and eat it all up, okay?

62
06:49.180 --> 06:50.230
Okay!

63
06:51.940 --> 06:53.330
Hey honey, some more coffee?

64
06:55.120 --> 06:55.890
Uh...

65
06:56.030 --> 06:57.040
I better not.

66
07:10.240 --> 07:11.230
All right!

67
07:11.360 --> 07:12.720
I'm off to work, everyone.

68
07:14.590 --> 07:16.590
Have a good day, honey.

69
07:14.540 --> 07:16.620
Bye, mama.

70
07:17.320 --> 07:19.370
Hey, you're gonna be late if you don't hurry.

71
07:20.010 --> 07:20.740
Oh yeah.

72
07:22.700 --> 07:23.580
See you later!

73
07:23.340 --> 07:24.550
Have a great day!

74
07:24.530 --> 07:25.870
Have a great day!

75
07:40.690 --> 07:41.680
Good morning, guys!

76
07:42.390 --> 07:43.280
Good morning.

77
07:43.640 --> 07:44.940
What took you so long, Madoka?

78
07:45.350 --> 07:47.130
Look at you with your cute ribbons.

79
07:47.320 --> 07:48.100
You think so?

80
07:48.220 --> 07:49.280
They're not too flashy?

81
07:49.740 --> 07:51.050
I think they look lovely.

82
08:00.810 --> 08:05.560
My mom said that if a boy can't say he loves
you to your face, he's not worth your time.

83
08:06.000 --> 08:08.100
Your mom is way cool, Madoka!

84
08:08.190 --> 08:10.900
I mean she's smart, gorgeous and successful.

85
08:11.850 --> 08:15.230
If only I could make up my mind as easily as that.

86
08:16.900 --> 08:18.800
If only everyone could have your problems.

87
08:18.990 --> 08:20.140
You know, she is right.

88
08:20.270 --> 08:23.060
I wish someone would send me a love letter some time.

89
08:23.210 --> 08:24.450
It'd be nice to get one.

90
08:24.660 --> 08:26.160
Ah, now I get it.

91
08:26.290 --> 08:29.170
You want to be as beautiful and
popular as Hitomi, don't ya?

92
08:29.530 --> 08:32.450
I bet that's why you're wearing
those ribbons to change your image.

93
08:32.570 --> 08:33.390
That's not true!

94
08:33.490 --> 08:34.850
My mom picked these out and...

95
08:34.970 --> 08:38.210
You tricked your mom to tell you the
secret to being popular, didn't you?

96
08:38.480 --> 08:40.030
I'm not gonna let that happen!

97
08:40.250 --> 08:40.910
Ha!

98
08:41.990 --> 08:42.620
No!

99
08:43.120 --> 08:44.160
No, stop it!

100
08:44.660 --> 08:45.150
No!

101
08:45.450 --> 08:46.700
You're just too cute!

102
08:46.990 --> 08:49.090
I'm not gonna let you be popular with the boys.

103
08:49.280 --> 08:50.240
You're mine, Madoka!

104
08:50.350 --> 08:51.510
Mine, mine, mine.

105
08:53.400 --> 08:54.380
Ahem.

106
09:02.300 --> 09:02.900
Ahem.

107
09:03.240 --> 09:05.460
I have a very important issue to discuss today.

108
09:05.620 --> 09:07.200
So eyes front, ears open!

109
09:08.020 --> 09:11.150
The correct way to fry an egg is sunny side up or down?

110
09:11.390 --> 09:13.200
Come on, Nakazawa. I don't have all day.

111
09:13.340 --> 09:14.970
I... I gue... uh...

112
09:15.420 --> 09:17.060
You can fry either way, can't you?

113
09:17.350 --> 09:18.200
Yes, precisely.

114
09:18.440 --> 09:19.830
You can fry either way!

115
09:20.000 --> 09:24.460
Therefore, go through without saying that you should never
judge a women's beauty by the way she fries her eggs.

116
09:25.440 --> 09:30.470
Remember, girls, do not associate with men who
refuse to eat eggs that's been fried sunny side down.

117
09:30.980 --> 09:32.340
I guess it didn't work out.

118
09:32.470 --> 09:33.760
But what gave you that idea?

119
09:33.900 --> 09:38.960
And you boys, better make sure you don't grow up to be men who
complain about how the damn eggs are cooked, understand?!

120
09:40.230 --> 09:45.230
Well, now that that's out of the way,
let's give a big warm welcome to our new classmate!

121
09:45.430 --> 09:47.580
Uh, maybe that should've come first?

122
09:47.650 --> 09:48.920
Come in, Miss Akemi.

123
09:49.060 --> 09:50.030
Don't be shy!

124
09:52.120 --> 09:53.140
Wow!

125
09:54.560 --> 09:56.280
Wow, she's super gorgeous.

126
09:59.850 --> 10:00.480
Huh?

127
10:02.550 --> 10:03.270
No way!

128
10:03.390 --> 10:04.800
It couldn't be!

129
10:04.970 --> 10:07.390
Why don't you tell the class
a little bit about yourself?

130
10:08.200 --> 10:09.450
I'm Homura Akemi.

131
10:09.750 --> 10:10.900
It's nice to meet you.

132
10:31.740 --> 10:32.550
Uh...

133
10:32.930 --> 10:34.660
Um...

134
10:37.890 --> 10:40.800
Uh, Miss Akemi?

135
10:44.650 --> 10:47.050
What school did you go to before coming to this one?

136
10:47.600 --> 10:49.950
I went to a private Catholic school in Tokyo.

137
10:50.280 --> 10:51.180
Were you in a club?

138
10:51.350 --> 10:52.230
How about sports?

139
10:52.500 --> 10:53.500
Were you on any teams?

140
10:53.880 --> 10:54.930
No, not really.

141
10:55.180 --> 10:56.790
Your hair is really beautiful!

142
10:57.020 --> 10:59.130
What kind of shampoo do you like to use?

143
10:59.370 --> 11:02.730
There's something awfully mysterious
about that girl, don't you think?

144
11:03.310 --> 11:05.390
Hey, Madoka, do you know that girl?

145
11:05.630 --> 11:08.730
I could've sworn to you she was glaring
at you when she was in front of the class.

146
11:08.850 --> 11:10.360
Well, I'm not really sure...

147
11:11.070 --> 11:12.040
I'm sorry.

148
11:12.390 --> 11:14.620
I think today's been a little stressful for me.

149
11:14.930 --> 11:16.250
I'm not feeling very well.

150
11:17.690 --> 11:19.600
May I please go to the Nurse's Office?

151
11:19.900 --> 11:20.560
Ah, sure.

152
11:20.680 --> 11:22.090
If you want, I can take you over there.

153
11:22.330 --> 11:22.880
Good idea!

154
11:23.030 --> 11:23.930
Can I come too?

155
11:24.500 --> 11:26.110
Please don't trouble yourselves.

156
11:26.550 --> 11:28.310
I'll ask the Nurse's Aide to take me.

157
11:29.780 --> 11:30.530
Huh?

158
11:33.840 --> 11:35.670
Miss Madoka Kaname.

159
11:35.880 --> 11:38.560
You are the Nurse's Aide for this class, are you not?

160
11:38.950 --> 11:39.590
Huh?

161
11:39.830 --> 11:40.690
Um, well...

162
11:40.970 --> 11:41.860
I uh...

163
11:42.160 --> 11:43.490
Would you please come with me?

164
11:43.970 --> 11:45.090
To the Nurse's Office.

165
11:52.910 --> 11:55.160
Um, I...was...

166
11:55.650 --> 11:58.660
H-How did you know I was the Nurse's Aide for the class?

167
12:01.750 --> 12:04.240
Ms Saotome told me that you were.

168
12:04.500 --> 12:05.860
Oh, right, of course she did.

169
12:06.250 --> 12:09.090
By the way, the Nurse's Office is over there.

170
12:10.690 --> 12:11.650
This way, right?

171
12:11.560 --> 12:12.360
Huh?

172
12:12.830 --> 12:13.990
Uh, yeah, that's right.

173
12:14.100 --> 12:15.720
But, um...

174
12:15.820 --> 12:18.470
So anyway, how do you know your way there?

175
12:18.680 --> 12:20.510
I mean you're new here and all.

176
12:27.610 --> 12:31.160
Um...Miss, um...Akemi?

177
12:34.470 --> 12:35.610
Call me Homura.

178
12:36.640 --> 12:38.400
Oh, Homura.

179
12:38.780 --> 12:39.560
What is it?

180
12:39.650 --> 12:43.540
Uh, nothing. It's just that...you have an unusual name.

181
12:45.550 --> 12:50.340
But not in a bad way or anything,
I was just thinking how it sounded cool...

182
12:50.610 --> 12:52.100
for a first name, I mean.

183
12:59.510 --> 13:03.290
Madoka Kaname, do you treasure
the life you currently live?

184
13:03.710 --> 13:06.620
And do you consider your family
and your friends precious?

185
13:07.330 --> 13:10.080
Oh, well, I uh...

186
13:10.180 --> 13:11.300
Of course I do.

187
13:11.500 --> 13:13.050
I mean I-I do.

188
13:13.340 --> 13:18.940
My family and my friends, I love them very
much and yes they're very precious to me.

189
13:20.120 --> 13:20.950
Do you mean it?

190
13:21.130 --> 13:22.110
Absolutely.

191
13:22.260 --> 13:23.580
I couldn't lie about that!

192
13:24.830 --> 13:25.440
Good.

193
13:25.790 --> 13:32.130
Because if that's the truth, then you wouldn't try
changing the life you have or the person you are.

194
13:32.610 --> 13:36.030
Otherwise, you'd lose everything you love.

195
13:36.300 --> 13:37.170
Huh?

196
13:37.570 --> 13:38.460
Don't change.

197
13:38.640 --> 13:40.310
Stay as you are, Madoka Kaname.

198
13:41.220 --> 13:43.450
Stay as you are, forever.

199
14:02.720 --> 14:04.400
Wow...

200
14:15.820 --> 14:16.690
Wow...

201
14:17.290 --> 14:19.930
She breaks the record of every school in this city?!

202
14:21.800 --> 14:23.470
I can't believe you can jump that high!

203
14:50.340 --> 14:51.600
She said what?!

204
14:51.840 --> 14:53.610
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

205
14:53.820 --> 14:58.270
When I was thinking she was this awesome
girl but it turns out she is a total psycho!

206
14:58.410 --> 15:02.340
Ah! I hope she doesn't think acting
like a weird transfer student is cool.

207
15:02.520 --> 15:04.420
That's so MOE? It makes me sick!

208
15:04.640 --> 15:06.730
This has to be misunderstanding.

209
15:06.850 --> 15:08.830
Are you positive you've never met her before?

210
15:09.050 --> 15:09.890
Hmm...

211
15:10.030 --> 15:12.220
I guess the sensible answer will be "yes."

212
15:12.390 --> 15:13.930
Okay, what do you mean by sensible?

213
15:14.170 --> 15:15.560
Either you met her or you didn't?

214
15:15.870 --> 15:16.870
Well, it's like...

215
15:17.080 --> 15:22.080
You're gonna think I'm weird but I
first met her in a dream or something.

216
15:23.000 --> 15:25.250
Hahahaha... That's awesome!

217
15:25.430 --> 15:27.670
An anime character in you's popping out, too!

218
15:29.150 --> 15:30.520
This is really bugging me!

219
15:30.990 --> 15:32.470
I got it all figured out.

220
15:32.660 --> 15:37.930
You guys knew each other in the past life and the fate is
reached across time and space to bring you back together again.

221
15:38.450 --> 15:40.590
In your dream, what happened when you met her?

222
15:40.890 --> 15:43.900
That's the thing. I can't really
remember what happened in it.

223
15:44.270 --> 15:47.310
All I know is that was really strange and spooky.

224
15:47.560 --> 15:52.400
If you want my opinion, I think it's entirely
possibly you met Miss Akemi somewhere before.

225
15:52.580 --> 15:53.250
Huh?!

226
15:53.350 --> 15:57.470
You might not remember meeting her,
but your subconscious certainly took note of it.

227
15:57.760 --> 16:01.450
When you were having that dream,
your subconscious simply brought up the image of her.

228
16:01.760 --> 16:02.550
Seriously?

229
16:02.800 --> 16:04.740
That's the heck of coincidence, don't you think?

230
16:04.890 --> 16:05.760
Uh, perhaps.

231
16:06.020 --> 16:08.560
Uh-oh, look how late it's gotten.

232
16:08.790 --> 16:11.330
Excuse me, but I really should be going now.

233
16:12.030 --> 16:13.970
Is it Piano today or classical dance?

234
16:14.090 --> 16:15.660
Tea Ceremony lessons today.

235
16:15.980 --> 16:20.490
Even though our Exams are coming up,
my mother still wants me to continue taking them.

236
16:20.640 --> 16:23.890
Yeah, there's another reason to
be glad I wasn't born a rich girl.

237
16:24.160 --> 16:25.510
We should get going too.

238
16:25.970 --> 16:29.160
Madoka, you wanna hit the music store on the way home?

239
16:29.340 --> 16:30.030
Okay.

240
16:30.270 --> 16:31.690
Something for Kyosuke again?

241
16:32.820 --> 16:33.890
Yeah, maybe.

242
16:36.910 --> 16:37.940
Have fun shopping!

243
16:38.120 --> 16:38.860
Later!

244
18:12.990 --> 18:14.040
Is that you?

245
18:14.830 --> 18:16.060
Help me...

246
18:22.850 --> 18:23.870
Homura?

247
18:24.340 --> 18:25.740
Get away from that creature.

248
18:26.340 --> 18:28.630
B-But he's really hurt.

249
18:32.860 --> 18:34.200
Leave him alone.

250
18:34.530 --> 18:35.930
Why are you trying to hurt him?

251
18:36.680 --> 18:38.190
This doesn't concern you.

252
18:38.580 --> 18:39.810
But he was calling me!

253
18:40.060 --> 18:41.570
I could hear him calling my name!

254
18:41.770 --> 18:43.180
He was asking me to help him!

255
18:43.440 --> 18:44.120
Really?

256
18:59.070 --> 19:00.190
Over here, Madoka!

257
19:00.430 --> 19:01.070
Sayaka!

258
19:28.410 --> 19:29.850
Why is this happening now?

259
19:32.110 --> 19:33.900
Now she's attacking you on cosplay?

260
19:34.150 --> 19:35.080
What's her problem?

261
19:35.320 --> 19:36.890
And what's that thing you're carrying?

262
19:37.130 --> 19:39.570
Looks like a stuffed animal. Is it alive?

263
19:40.280 --> 19:40.880
I don't know.

264
19:41.170 --> 19:44.220
I don't know why this is
happening, but we have to save him!

265
19:49.070 --> 19:50.060
Where'd the exit go?

266
19:50.290 --> 19:51.250
Where are we?

267
19:52.180 --> 19:53.330
I don't like this place.

268
19:54.010 --> 19:55.500
Everything keeps changing!

269
19:57.950 --> 19:58.850
Oh, crap!

270
19:59.120 --> 20:00.500
What the heck's going on?!

271
20:02.980 --> 20:04.120
There's something over there!

272
20:26.750 --> 20:28.980
Is this some kinda joke, right?

273
20:29.400 --> 20:32.350
I'm stuck in a bad dream, but I am dreaming, right?

274
20:32.590 --> 20:33.680
Right, Madoka?!

275
20:47.720 --> 20:48.760
What's happening?

276
20:49.060 --> 20:49.780
I don't know.

277
20:50.250 --> 20:51.470
That was close, wasn't it?

278
20:52.060 --> 20:53.340
But don't worry, you're safe now.

279
21:00.410 --> 21:01.530
Thank goodness.

280
21:01.720 --> 21:03.040
You rescued Kyubey for me.

281
21:03.380 --> 21:04.340
I'm very grateful.

282
21:04.640 --> 21:06.730
He's a dear friend of mine and I was so worried.

283
21:07.580 --> 21:09.020
He called out to me.

284
21:09.310 --> 21:12.370
I could hear his voice inside my head.

285
21:13.760 --> 21:15.560
Ahh, I see.

286
21:16.180 --> 21:20.050
I can tell by your uniforms that you
both go to Mitakihara Middle School.

287
21:20.570 --> 21:21.520
Are you 8th graders?

288
21:22.120 --> 21:22.650
Who are you?

289
21:23.500 --> 21:24.640
Oh, that's right.

290
21:24.790 --> 21:26.300
Maybe I should introduce myself.

291
21:27.630 --> 21:29.890
Actually, it's going to have to wait a bit.

292
21:38.320 --> 21:39.420
Please excuse me.

293
21:39.630 --> 21:40.870
I have to wrap this up first.

294
22:18.680 --> 22:20.320
Wow, amazing!

295
22:24.910 --> 22:25.930
We're back!

296
22:32.970 --> 22:34.490
The witch managed to escape.

297
22:34.730 --> 22:37.090
If you wanna finish it off, you'd better go after it.

298
22:37.440 --> 22:39.390
I won't mind if you take it this time.

299
22:40.010 --> 22:41.890
But I still have work to do here.

300
22:42.470 --> 22:44.060
You don't understand, do you?

301
22:44.250 --> 22:46.270
I'm telling you I'm willing to overlook this.

302
22:50.640 --> 22:54.550
Honestly, don't you think it would be
best if we didn't do this right now?

303
23:23.240 --> 23:24.380
Thank you, Mami!

304
23:24.680 --> 23:25.690
You're a lifesaver!

305
23:25.990 --> 23:27.400
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

306
23:27.750 --> 23:28.630
They saved you.

307
23:28.860 --> 23:30.180
I was just passing by.

308
23:31.020 --> 23:32.330
Thank you very much!

309
23:32.750 --> 23:33.930
My name is Kyubey.

310
23:34.600 --> 23:36.750
Were you the one who was calling for help?

311
23:37.020 --> 23:38.430
That's right, Madoka Kaname,

312
23:38.940 --> 23:40.290
And Sayaka Miki.

313
23:40.660 --> 23:41.920
Wow, hang on a sec.

314
23:42.090 --> 23:43.270
How do you know our names?

315
23:43.480 --> 23:46.060
I came here because I have a favor to ask of you both.

316
23:46.710 --> 23:47.410
Huh?

317
23:47.590 --> 23:48.520
What do you mean?

318
23:49.430 --> 23:53.780
I want you to make contracts
with me,and become magical girls!

319
25:26.160 --> 25:28.990
I will grant each of you one wish, any wish you desire.

320
25:29.450 --> 25:29.980
Huh?

321
25:30.160 --> 25:30.840
For reals?

322
25:31.030 --> 25:31.980
Anything at all?

323
25:32.290 --> 25:33.190
Anything at all.

324
25:33.420 --> 25:35.730
I can grant the most impossible of miracles!

325
25:36.100 --> 25:38.910
That would be truly wonderful.

326
07:19.200 --> 07:19.700
Huh?!

327
15:27.530 --> 15:29.020
Come on, that's mean!

328
16:37.930 --> 16:38.790
Bye bye!

329
17:15.220 --> 17:15.990
<i>Help me!</i>

330
17:16.440 --> 17:17.040
<i>Huh?</i>

331
17:20.090 --> 17:21.980
<i>Madoka, help me!</i>
