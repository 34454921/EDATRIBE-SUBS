00:03.430 --> 00:04.210
Ah!

2
00:04.790 --> 00:09.330
For all the happiness you wish for someone,
someone else gets cursed with equal misery.

3
00:09.850 --> 00:14.000
That's how it works for magical girls,
and that's how it is for me.

4
00:16.990 --> 00:18.030
I was stupid...

5
00:18.870 --> 00:20.180
so stupid...

6
00:32.940 --> 00:34.420
Ah, Sayaka!

7
00:47.440 --> 00:48.390
What the hell...?

8
00:48.960 --> 00:49.970
What are you?

9
00:50.560 --> 00:52.220
What have you done to Sayaka?!

10
00:56.390 --> 00:57.510
No, get back.

11
01:03.500 --> 01:04.860
Take my hand.

12
01:05.220 --> 01:06.300
What are you gonna do?

13
01:07.730 --> 01:08.600
Just do it!

14
01:15.880 --> 01:16.740
It's stopped!

15
01:17.040 --> 01:18.610
Do not let go of my hand.

16
01:18.820 --> 01:20.550
You'll be frozen in time if you do.

17
01:20.750 --> 01:21.600
Hurry!

18
01:21.880 --> 01:23.160
What the hell is going on?

19
01:23.350 --> 01:24.640
Where did that witch come from?

20
01:24.900 --> 01:26.580
That witch used to be Sayaka Miki.

21
01:27.290 --> 01:29.630
You saw, it happened right in front of you.

22
01:29.780 --> 01:31.090
We're just gonna run away?

23
01:31.290 --> 01:33.230
We could stop her now and kill it.

24
01:33.350 --> 01:35.350
Just drop that useless baggage and we'll go back.

25
01:35.830 --> 01:36.800
Shall we?

26
01:36.890 --> 01:37.810
Teal, like hell!

27
01:38.150 --> 01:39.650
You can't fight and carry her.

28
01:39.900 --> 01:41.040
You'll get us both killed.

29
01:41.310 --> 01:42.490
We're leaving for now.

30
03:47.520 --> 03:48.270
Huh?

31
03:51.440 --> 03:52.240
Sayaka!

32
03:53.620 --> 03:55.380
Sayaka! What happened?

33
03:57.140 --> 03:58.180
Where's her Soul Gem?

34
03:59.060 --> 04:00.240
Wh-What happened to her?

35
04:01.120 --> 04:02.510
Her Soul Gem disappeared.

36
04:02.800 --> 04:04.640
It transformed into a Grief Seed.

37
04:05.210 --> 04:06.960
A witch hatched and it vanished.

38
04:11.310 --> 04:12.210
No...

39
04:12.490 --> 04:13.530
It can't be...

40
04:14.100 --> 04:14.910
It is.

41
04:15.170 --> 04:17.900
That's the final secret of the Soul Gems.

42
04:18.250 --> 04:21.810
When our gems get too tainted and turn completely black,

43
04:21.970 --> 04:23.670
we transform into Grief Seeds.

44
04:24.360 --> 04:26.220
Then we are reborn as witches.

45
04:27.670 --> 04:28.540
See?

46
04:28.930 --> 04:32.730
This is the destiny which no magical girl can escape.

47
04:34.990 --> 04:36.160
It's not true.

48
04:36.740 --> 04:38.150
It can't be true.

49
04:38.430 --> 04:39.270
Right?

50
04:46.750 --> 04:47.520
But...

51
04:48.080 --> 04:49.000
how...?

52
04:49.470 --> 04:50.320
She...

53
04:50.660 --> 04:53.540
She only wanted to protect people from witches.

54
04:54.250 --> 04:55.980
She wanted to be a hero.

55
04:56.700 --> 04:59.420
That's why she became a magical girl.

56
05:00.200 --> 05:01.100
Why?

57
05:01.880 --> 05:04.320
Her curse became as powerful as her wish.

58
05:04.440 --> 05:06.110
It was only a matter of time, really.

59
05:06.650 --> 05:09.450
And from now on, for each person she saved,

60
05:09.690 --> 05:11.420
she'll curse another in return.

61
05:23.160 --> 05:24.240
Why you...!

62
05:24.610 --> 05:26.030
What the hell is your problem?

63
05:26.550 --> 05:29.130
You're trying to impress us with
your big brain or something?

64
05:29.860 --> 05:32.490
How can you stand there talking crap like that?!

65
05:32.810 --> 05:34.090
She was Sayaka's...

66
05:35.850 --> 05:37.480
She was her best friend!

67
05:39.670 --> 05:41.480
You understand now, don't you?

68
05:42.130 --> 05:44.200
The thing you wanted so much to be.

69
05:44.860 --> 05:45.810
This is it.

70
05:47.200 --> 05:51.430
Oh, and the body you brought along,
it's your responsibility now.

71
05:52.010 --> 05:55.790
You better be careful getting rid of it
though, or it'll cause problems later.

72
05:56.030 --> 05:57.740
And do you dare call yourself human?!

73
05:57.950 --> 05:59.340
No, of course I don't.

74
06:01.070 --> 06:02.050
Neither should you.

75
06:02.170 --> 06:03.010
Ugh.

76
06:19.970 --> 06:20.890
May I come in?

77
06:21.230 --> 06:22.300
I'd like to talk with you.

78
06:23.470 --> 06:24.720
You're still alive...

79
06:27.490 --> 06:30.600
That stuff Homura was saying, is it true?

80
06:31.050 --> 06:33.160
It's true enough that I can't deny it.

81
06:35.610 --> 06:36.580
Then...

82
06:36.810 --> 06:40.350
you turned us into magical girls,
so...we become witches?

83
06:40.870 --> 06:43.130
Please don't misunderstand our intentions.

84
06:43.420 --> 06:47.420
We don't do what we do because we
harbor ill will towards the human race.

85
06:47.730 --> 06:51.090
Everything we've done is to
prolong the life of the universe.

86
06:51.460 --> 06:55.260
Madoka, do you know what the word "entropy" means?

87
06:56.280 --> 06:57.480
Here's an example.

88
06:58.000 --> 07:03.350
The energy a bonfire gives off is not equal to
the energy it took to grow the wood that fuels it.

89
07:03.750 --> 07:06.510
When energy changes form, some of it gets lost.

90
07:07.370 --> 07:10.680
We found that the amount of energy
in the universe is decreasing.

91
07:10.980 --> 07:16.340
So we began searching for a form of energy that
wasn't limited by the laws of thermodynamics.

92
07:17.200 --> 07:20.590
And then we found the energy,
created by magical girls.

93
07:23.150 --> 07:24.140
What are you...

94
07:24.920 --> 07:25.840
really?

95
07:26.560 --> 07:28.900
My civilization created a technology that

96
07:29.000 --> 07:32.170
converts the emotions of a
sentient lifeform's into energy.

97
07:32.610 --> 07:37.540
Unfortunately, our species doesn't possess
the capacity to experience emotions.

98
07:37.740 --> 07:41.480
So we searched the universe
and studied all the various species,

99
07:41.840 --> 07:44.130
until we finally found you humans.

100
07:47.610 --> 07:51.170
With the size of your population
and the rate at which you reproduce,

101
07:51.420 --> 07:55.240
we saw how the amount of emotional
energy produced by a single human

102
07:55.420 --> 07:58.890
is greater than the amount used
between its birth and growth.

103
07:59.070 --> 08:03.310
The human soul is the energy source we need
that counteracts the effects of entropy.

104
08:04.350 --> 08:08.660
The most effective energy came from females
in their second stage of development,

105
08:08.910 --> 08:12.420
when they have the most intense
fluctuations of hope and despair.

106
08:12.620 --> 08:16.520
At the precise moment when your Soul
Gems flare out and become Grief Seeds,

107
08:16.830 --> 08:19.140
an enormous amount of energy is created.

108
08:19.450 --> 08:23.260
As an incubator, my job is to
gather up that expended energy.

109
08:24.990 --> 08:26.790
That's all we are to you...

110
08:27.040 --> 08:28.060
disposable?

111
08:28.720 --> 08:30.120
You want us to die for you.

112
08:30.420 --> 08:31.550
And you don't even care.

113
08:32.300 --> 08:35.030
Do you know how many civilizations
there are in the universe?

114
08:35.280 --> 08:38.370
Can you even comprehend the amount
of energy they use each second?

115
08:38.760 --> 08:42.680
There will come a day when you humans
figure out how to leave this planet,

116
08:42.910 --> 08:44.820
and you'll join the rest of the universe.

117
08:45.010 --> 08:49.130
When you do, you wouldn't wanna find the
universe empty and desolate, would you?

118
08:49.440 --> 08:52.230
If you consider the long term, this is a good deal,

119
08:52.610 --> 08:53.950
for you and everyone else.

120
08:55.600 --> 08:57.170
How can you say that?

121
08:57.650 --> 09:00.020
Do you think it's okay for Mami to die...

122
09:00.320 --> 09:02.070
and Sayaka to suffer...

123
09:02.500 --> 09:04.730
some crazy reason like that?

124
09:05.000 --> 09:06.580
That's not right!

125
09:07.000 --> 09:08.330
That's so mean!

126
09:09.290 --> 09:14.190
But we always ask for and make sure to receive
your consent before making the contract.

127
09:14.420 --> 09:17.430
That alone should show you that
we don't mean you any ill will?

128
09:17.540 --> 09:19.700
But you do it by tricking us into it!

129
09:20.060 --> 09:22.900
We don't understand this concept of "tricking you."

130
09:23.180 --> 09:26.350
Why is it that when humans regret a decision they made

131
09:26.510 --> 09:30.360
based on their own misunderstanding,
they feel resentment toward the other party?

132
09:31.360 --> 09:32.730
I can't do this.

133
09:33.000 --> 09:34.780
You're not saying anything.

134
09:34.950 --> 09:36.810
I don't understand you at all.

135
09:37.230 --> 09:41.270
We've had such a hard time understanding
you humans and your values system too.

136
09:41.580 --> 09:46.770
With a current population of 6.9 billion
which increases by a rate of 10 every 4 seconds,

137
09:47.040 --> 09:51.480
it's a mystery why you would care so
much about the loss of a tiny handful?

138
09:52.020 --> 09:55.550
If that's how you think about us, then I guess...

139
09:56.180 --> 09:57.800
you really are our enemy.

140
09:58.500 --> 10:01.410
I came here try to explain ourselves to you.

141
10:01.650 --> 10:06.960
I was genuinely hoping you'd understand how much
good humanity sacrifices have done for this universe.

142
10:07.240 --> 10:09.030
I guess I wasn't successful.

143
10:09.450 --> 10:10.640
Of course, you weren't!

144
10:10.960 --> 10:15.430
I still believe that one day,
you'll become the greatest of all magical girls,

145
10:15.650 --> 10:17.910
and then the worst of all witches.

146
10:18.330 --> 10:22.670
And when that happens, we'll have access
to an unbelievable amount of energy.

147
10:23.030 --> 10:27.150
So if you ever feel like dying for
the sake of the universe, call me.

148
10:27.540 --> 10:28.510
I'll be waiting.

149
10:48.390 --> 10:52.020
What are you hoping for by using all
that energy just to keep her body fresh?

150
10:59.040 --> 11:01.540
Is there a way to get her Soul Gem back, the way it was?

151
11:02.010 --> 11:04.280
If there is a way, I'm not aware of it.

152
11:06.430 --> 11:07.380
That's funny.

153
11:07.630 --> 11:10.740
It looks like even you don't
have all the answers, do ya?

154
11:11.080 --> 11:14.000
The existence of magical girls defies logic.

155
11:14.190 --> 11:16.180
So I wouldn't be surprised if you turned out

156
11:16.230 --> 11:18.910
you were capable of doing all kinds of amazing things.

157
11:19.180 --> 11:20.620
Then it is possible.

158
11:20.950 --> 11:24.610
It hasn't happened before so I'm not
really sure how you'd go about it.

159
11:24.970 --> 11:27.530
Unfortunately, I can't advise you on the matter.

160
11:32.280 --> 11:33.450
Hell like I needed.

161
11:34.840 --> 11:35.870
Who'd ask...

162
11:36.200 --> 11:37.640
for your...

163
11:37.900 --> 11:38.760
advice...

164
11:39.050 --> 11:39.820
now?!

165
11:46.580 --> 11:49.640
Madoka, you're looking a bit under the weather today.

166
11:50.290 --> 11:51.250
Are you okay?

167
11:51.910 --> 11:52.690
Mm-hm.

168
11:53.000 --> 11:54.710
I just didn't get enough sleep.

169
11:55.520 --> 11:56.550
That's too bad.

170
11:56.840 --> 11:58.870
And it looks Sayaka's staying home again.

171
11:59.950 --> 12:02.440
Maybe we should go and see how she's doing.

172
12:02.720 --> 12:05.760
Although, I don't think she'll be too happy to see me.

173
12:06.080 --> 12:07.260
Things've been...

174
12:07.440 --> 12:09.650
a little bit awkward between us lately.

175
12:22.700 --> 12:23.700
Madoka?

176
12:28.280 --> 12:29.120
Mm...

177
12:30.750 --> 12:32.620
Hitomi, sorry.

178
12:32.840 --> 12:33.930
I can't go to school.

179
12:34.260 --> 12:35.560
I-I better go back home!

180
12:36.390 --> 12:38.130
But, Madoka, wait!

181
12:47.440 --> 12:49.360
Um, you wanted to talk?

182
12:49.760 --> 12:50.750
Uh-huh.

183
12:51.150 --> 12:52.780
You wanna save Sayaka Miki?

184
12:52.880 --> 12:56.070
Ah? Do you think there a way, really?

185
12:56.320 --> 12:58.600
If there wasn't, you just gonna leave her like that?

186
12:58.950 --> 12:59.990
Um...

187
13:01.280 --> 13:03.270
That came out the wrong way, my bad.

188
13:03.500 --> 13:05.860
I know this sounds kinda crazy but...

189
13:06.050 --> 13:07.650
the thing is...

190
13:07.870 --> 13:09.720
we don't know she can be saved yet or not.

191
13:09.870 --> 13:12.380
So if there's still hope for that,
I'm not gonna give up.

192
13:16.180 --> 13:18.130
Even if she was turned into a witch,

193
13:18.370 --> 13:21.240
maybe she'd be able to remember the voice of her friend.

194
13:21.610 --> 13:22.410
I was thinking,

195
13:22.670 --> 13:25.640
maybe if you call out to her,
she'll remember being human.

196
13:25.930 --> 13:29.990
If anyone could get through to her,
it'd have to be you.

197
13:32.230 --> 13:34.030
You think that'll really work?

198
13:34.400 --> 13:35.780
Oh, how the hell should I know?

199
13:37.430 --> 13:38.310
Hehe.

200
13:38.450 --> 13:40.430
Nobody knows, that's what I wanna try!

201
13:40.740 --> 13:42.050
Hell, it's worth the shot!

202
13:42.290 --> 13:44.830
Check it out, what if when I cut that witch in half,

203
13:45.070 --> 13:47.600
instead of getting the usual Grief Seed out of it,

204
13:47.800 --> 13:50.590
what if Sayaka's Soul Gem comes
popping out of it instead!

205
13:51.530 --> 13:52.880
Wouldn't that be something?

206
13:53.110 --> 13:56.550
It'd be like one of those stories where
love and courage triumph and stuff.

207
13:59.680 --> 14:00.790
Wanna know something?

208
14:01.080 --> 14:02.370
And this is between us,

209
14:02.690 --> 14:06.370
the reason I became a magical girl
was 'cause I love stories like those.

210
14:06.760 --> 14:08.440
Can't believe I forgot that.

211
14:08.650 --> 14:11.410
And Sayaka was the one who reminded me.

212
14:13.430 --> 14:16.210
It's cool if you don't wanna come,
I'm not gonna force you.

213
14:16.510 --> 14:19.450
I mean, it's gonna be pretty dangerous for sure.

214
14:20.060 --> 14:23.340
And you know, if things start
getting super hairy in there,

215
14:23.430 --> 14:25.430
I can't promise I'll be able to protect you.

216
14:25.790 --> 14:26.620
Uh-uh.

217
14:27.270 --> 14:28.130
I'll help.

218
14:28.390 --> 14:30.070
I really wanna help.

219
14:34.760 --> 14:36.970
My name is Madoka Kaname.

220
14:38.670 --> 14:39.940
Oh, seriously?

221
14:40.260 --> 14:42.710
Man, you're so cramping my style.

222
14:42.710 --> 14:43.360
Huh?

223
14:43.900 --> 14:45.090
I'm Kyoko Sakura.

224
14:45.700 --> 14:46.990
Pleased to meet ya.

225
14:47.530 --> 14:48.690
Uh?

226
14:50.620 --> 14:51.710
Uhh...

227
14:58.590 --> 14:59.500
Excuse me.

228
14:59.850 --> 15:01.430
May I go to the nurse's office?

229
15:01.770 --> 15:02.750
I'm not feeling well.

230
15:03.090 --> 15:04.160
Hmm?

231
15:04.300 --> 15:06.160
Okay. Who's the nurse's aide for this class.

232
15:06.570 --> 15:07.630
Miss Kaname is.

233
15:07.840 --> 15:08.870
But she's not here today.

234
15:09.260 --> 15:10.070
Hmm...

235
15:10.180 --> 15:12.270
I guess we'll have the class rep take you then, uh...

236
15:20.680 --> 15:22.870
Maybe Homura would wanna help.

237
15:23.280 --> 15:24.270
What do you think?

238
15:24.740 --> 15:25.390
Doubt it.

239
15:25.550 --> 15:26.770
Not really her style.

240
15:27.060 --> 15:28.390
Aren't you guys friends?

241
15:31.030 --> 15:31.970
Not really.

242
15:32.740 --> 15:35.390
Well, we sort of got the same goals, I guess.

243
15:35.680 --> 15:39.750
We kinda teamed up so could beat
whatever we couldn't beat by ourselves.

244
15:40.880 --> 15:44.910
In a couple of days,
Walpurgisnacht is gonna come to this town.

245
15:47.770 --> 15:49.140
Walpurgis...?

246
15:49.900 --> 15:52.040
It's an insanely powerful witch.

247
15:54.760 --> 15:58.020
This one's so nasty, neither of us could beat it alone.

248
15:58.400 --> 16:00.810
That's why we decided to team up to kill it.

249
16:01.210 --> 16:03.270
I guess that's how it is between us.

250
16:11.550 --> 16:12.600
This is it.

251
16:21.210 --> 16:23.250
Are you sure it's really Sayaka?

252
16:23.580 --> 16:25.730
I mean it might be another witch or something?

253
16:26.130 --> 16:28.630
The magic residue is the same as yesterday.

254
16:28.730 --> 16:29.560
It's her.

255
16:29.610 --> 16:30.670
No doubt about it.

256
16:45.920 --> 16:48.210
Okay, "point of no return" time.

257
16:48.660 --> 16:50.430
Are you sure you're ready for this?

258
16:50.920 --> 16:53.190
Actually, I'm used to this part.

259
16:53.560 --> 16:57.210
The thing is, all I ever did was tag along before.

260
16:57.590 --> 16:59.950
I've never really been able to help much.

261
17:00.270 --> 17:03.050
But I'm ready, so take me with you.

262
17:03.840 --> 17:06.420
You are such a weird girl, ain't ya?

263
17:15.440 --> 17:17.290
Hey, Kyoko?

264
17:17.570 --> 17:18.370
Yeah?

265
17:18.750 --> 17:20.390
I feel bad I can't help.

266
17:20.840 --> 17:23.470
Everyone else's always done the fighting for me.

267
17:23.970 --> 17:26.740
Anyway, I sort of feel like a coward.

268
17:26.910 --> 17:29.430
Why the heck would you ever wanna become a magical girl?

269
17:29.600 --> 17:30.300
Why?

270
17:30.330 --> 17:31.200
Um...

271
17:32.090 --> 17:33.270
Uh-uh.

272
17:33.560 --> 17:35.230
Don't underestimate this stuff.

273
17:35.460 --> 17:37.090
This ain't a job anybody can do.

274
17:37.360 --> 17:38.100
But...

275
17:38.320 --> 17:41.730
If you get to eat good food every day
and live a happy life with your family,

276
17:41.920 --> 17:44.950
why would you give that up
if you're not sure it's what you really want?

277
17:45.230 --> 17:49.050
You thinking about becoming a
magical girl on some stupid whim?

278
17:49.170 --> 17:50.940
I'd never allow that to happen.

279
17:51.320 --> 17:53.650
Hell, like I kick your ass before you could.

280
17:56.440 --> 17:58.990
If you do this, then you're putting your life in danger.

281
17:59.240 --> 18:02.360
The only people who should do this are
the ones who's got no other choice.

282
18:02.690 --> 18:06.070
Anybody else who sticks their
nose in it is just messing around.

283
18:06.380 --> 18:07.590
And that's dumb.

284
18:07.930 --> 18:09.260
You think so, huh?

285
18:09.670 --> 18:11.170
But you never know, right?

286
18:11.390 --> 18:12.740
Maybe there will come a time

287
18:12.840 --> 18:16.060
when your back's gonna be up against the wall
and you have to stand up and fight.

288
18:16.690 --> 18:19.160
If that day ever comes,
you can think about it then.

289
18:19.460 --> 18:20.360
Mm...

290
18:32.850 --> 18:34.420
Hey, Kyoko, why did you...

291
18:35.200 --> 18:35.630
Ah!?

292
18:35.630 --> 18:36.550
She knows we're here!

293
18:36.650 --> 18:37.400
She's coming!

294
18:54.090 --> 18:54.780
Okay.

295
18:54.970 --> 18:56.240
Do it just like we planned.

296
18:57.180 --> 18:57.800
Right.

297
18:58.900 --> 18:59.830
Hey, Sayaka.

298
19:00.040 --> 19:02.370
It's me, it's Madoka.

299
19:02.880 --> 19:05.130
Can...can you here me?

300
19:05.700 --> 19:07.250
Do you recognize my voice?

301
19:10.710 --> 19:12.720
Don't be scared! Keep talking to her!

302
19:14.850 --> 19:16.760
Sayaka, please stop!

303
19:17.060 --> 19:18.570
Try to remember, please!

304
19:18.880 --> 19:21.310
I know you never wanted to hurt anyone.

305
19:22.330 --> 19:25.300
You said you wanted to be a hero, remember?

306
19:25.620 --> 19:29.340
Please, Sayaka, turn back into your old self!

307
19:33.520 --> 19:35.040
Man, you're really stubborn.

308
19:35.290 --> 19:36.490
Come on, Sayaka!

309
19:36.910 --> 19:37.820
Snap out of it!

310
19:40.790 --> 19:41.500
Ah!

311
19:47.250 --> 19:48.140
Kyoko!

312
19:50.240 --> 19:51.060
I'm okay.

313
19:51.740 --> 19:52.680
This is nothing.

314
19:52.830 --> 19:53.790
I have worse...

315
19:54.400 --> 19:55.650
Just keep talking to her.

316
19:56.130 --> 19:57.240
Come on, Sayaka!

317
19:58.200 --> 19:59.050
Stop it!

318
19:59.380 --> 20:00.490
Please just stop!

319
20:00.730 --> 20:01.640
Sayaka!

320
20:01.830 --> 20:03.870
Please try to remember!

321
20:08.770 --> 20:09.490
Heh.

322
20:09.780 --> 20:11.080
Oh, I get what you're doing.

323
20:11.370 --> 20:12.760
This is payback, ain't it?

324
20:13.160 --> 20:14.180
Funny...

325
20:14.530 --> 20:16.970
When we met, we tried to kill each other then, too.

326
20:17.260 --> 20:19.290
I thought you were a wuss.

327
20:19.930 --> 20:21.800
But no matter how hard I beat you,

328
20:22.010 --> 20:25.120
man, you just kept getting right back up, didn't ya?

329
20:26.040 --> 20:27.190
I know you're mad.

330
20:27.450 --> 20:29.860
You can't forgive anyone for what happened to you.

331
20:31.720 --> 20:32.630
I get it.

332
20:34.300 --> 20:38.030
Once you get over that stuff, come back to us, okay?

333
20:49.370 --> 20:50.270
Sayaka...

334
20:50.630 --> 20:51.680
Please...

335
20:51.940 --> 20:52.900
Stop it...!

336
20:54.710 --> 20:55.830
Dammit, Sayaka!

337
20:59.550 --> 21:00.300
Come on!

338
21:00.550 --> 21:02.560
You told me you believed in your power!

339
21:02.860 --> 21:05.980
You said you were only gonna
use it to help people, remember?

340
21:33.800 --> 21:34.870
Huh?

341
21:35.060 --> 21:36.170
Kyoko!

342
21:39.700 --> 21:40.810
Hey...

343
21:41.460 --> 21:42.350
Are you...?

344
21:42.930 --> 21:44.610
Me and my stupid ideas.

345
21:44.900 --> 21:46.050
She shouldn't have come.

346
21:46.420 --> 21:47.480
Take care of her.

347
21:48.190 --> 21:49.400
Uh...

348
21:50.400 --> 21:53.560
You can't fight and carry her 'cause
you'll just get us both killed.

349
21:53.710 --> 21:55.040
It's okay.

350
21:55.570 --> 21:56.930
And you were right.

351
21:57.980 --> 22:01.140
You've gotta focus on the one
thing that means the most to you,

352
22:01.230 --> 22:02.760
and protect it to the end.

353
22:03.230 --> 22:05.650
Heh, it's kinda funny.

354
22:06.450 --> 22:08.000
You know, this whole time...

355
22:08.830 --> 22:10.820
that is exactly what I thought I was doing.

356
22:11.240 --> 22:14.640
Get out of here.

357
22:15.410 --> 22:16.140
Don't worry.

358
22:16.610 --> 22:17.850
I'll take care of her.

359
22:21.560 --> 22:22.650
I know, Sayaka.

360
22:24.720 --> 22:26.060
It sucks to be alone.

361
22:26.550 --> 22:27.830
Believe me, I know.

362
22:29.050 --> 22:30.230
But it's okay now,

363
22:30.580 --> 22:31.600
'cause I'm here with you,

364
22:32.200 --> 22:33.080
...Sayaka.

365
22:57.020 --> 22:58.200
Kyoko...

366
23:09.420 --> 23:10.800
I want to know the truth.

367
23:11.150 --> 23:14.480
Was there any chance for Kyoko
Sakura to save Sayaka Miki?

368
23:14.750 --> 23:15.780
Of course not.

369
23:15.990 --> 23:17.930
She should have known that was impossible.

370
23:18.420 --> 23:19.230
Really?

371
23:19.420 --> 23:21.390
Then, why didn't you try to stop her?

372
23:21.730 --> 23:24.490
I would've stopped her if I
thought her dying was pointless.

373
23:25.510 --> 23:29.620
But the fact is, her death actually
serves a more important purpose.

374
23:30.360 --> 23:31.680
Walpurgisnacht is coming,

375
23:32.050 --> 23:36.040
and you're the only magical
girl left to stand in its way.

376
23:36.160 --> 23:38.650
There's no way you can beat it all by yourself.

377
23:39.090 --> 23:43.790
So, if Madoka wants to protect this city,
she'll have to become a magical girl.

378
23:46.310 --> 23:47.320
That won't happen.

379
23:47.810 --> 23:48.840
I swear it.

380
25:27.960 --> 25:30.140
No one will believe me about the future.

381
25:31.310 --> 25:34.330
No one will accept the truth about the future.

382
25:36.510 --> 25:39.090
I won't rely on anyone anymore.

383
12:35.510 --> 12:36.190
Huh?

384
12:09.990 --> 12:12.620
<i>Hitomi, There's something...</i>

385
12:12.710 --> 12:13.760
<i>Seriously?</i>

386
12:14.050 --> 12:16.620
<i>After all that's happened,
you're gonna go to school today?</i>

387
12:23.960 --> 12:25.520
<i>Think you could meet me somewhere?</i>

388
12:25.910 --> 12:27.330
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

389
21:16.940 --> 21:20.740
<i>Hey, God, if you're there, my life sucked.</i>

390
21:21.230 --> 21:22.250
<i>So, for once...</i>

391
21:22.690 --> 21:23.550
<i>please...</i>

392
21:24.310 --> 21:25.960
<i>let me have a happy dream...</i>
