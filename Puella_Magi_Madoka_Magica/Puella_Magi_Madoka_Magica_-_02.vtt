00:00.000 --> 00:00.000


2
00:09.180 --> 00:10.830
I'm Mami Tomoe.

3
00:13.830 --> 00:16.520
I'm a 9th grader at Mitakihara Middle School.

4
00:20.660 --> 00:21.430
And...

5
00:22.380 --> 00:25.850
once I made a contract with
Kyubey, I became a magical girl.

6
00:39.140 --> 00:41.300
I had another weird dream.

7
00:42.350 --> 00:43.150
Huh?

8
00:44.020 --> 00:45.500
Good morning, Madoka.

9
00:46.020 --> 00:46.910
Ah!

10
00:47.430 --> 00:49.350
Hehehe...

11
02:20.820 --> 02:21.690
Madoka.

12
02:22.030 --> 02:24.560
You got in pretty late last night, didn't you?

13
02:25.180 --> 02:27.710
I got invited over to a friend's house.

14
02:29.570 --> 02:32.730
I don't wanna start cracking down
on you with curfews and stuff.

15
02:32.870 --> 02:34.950
Next time, let us know where you are before dinner.

16
02:35.250 --> 02:36.020
Mm-hmm.

17
02:36.210 --> 02:37.100
I'm sorry.

18
03:05.260 --> 03:05.930
Wow.

19
03:06.110 --> 03:07.230
Cool apartment.

20
03:07.380 --> 03:09.400
I live alone, so make yourselves at home.

21
03:09.680 --> 03:12.270
Although as far as refreshments go, I don't have much.

22
03:17.000 --> 03:17.900
Wow, Mami.

23
03:18.050 --> 03:19.310
This is so delicious!

24
03:19.590 --> 03:20.850
Mm, super delicious!

25
03:20.880 --> 03:21.690
Thank you.

26
03:22.800 --> 03:27.680
Since Kyubey chose the two of you, that means
you're both involved in this, like it or not.

27
03:27.970 --> 03:30.160
I though it might be good if we had a talk.

28
03:30.510 --> 03:31.330
Mm-hm.

29
03:31.600 --> 03:33.160
Go ahead, ask us anything you want.

30
03:33.270 --> 03:34.960
Sayaka, you've got it wrong.

31
03:37.530 --> 03:38.830
Ah, pretty!

32
03:39.390 --> 03:40.680
It's called a Soul Gem.

33
03:41.020 --> 03:45.390
When Kyubey chooses a girl,
it's created when she makes a contract with him.

34
03:45.870 --> 03:50.140
It's the source of our magic,
and it also proves that we're magical girls.

35
03:50.270 --> 03:51.380
What's this contract?

36
03:51.720 --> 03:55.080
I will grant each of you one wish, any wish you desire.

37
03:55.600 --> 03:56.110
Huh?

38
03:56.330 --> 03:56.980
For reals?

39
03:57.220 --> 03:58.290
Anything at all?

40
03:58.630 --> 03:59.430
Anything at all.

41
03:59.670 --> 04:02.290
I can grant the most impossible of miracles!

42
04:02.550 --> 04:04.740
Oh, we could wish for treasure.

43
04:04.890 --> 04:06.310
Or eternal youth?

44
04:06.450 --> 04:08.610
Or 108-course banquet?

45
04:08.840 --> 04:10.950
Maybe that last one's a bit much.

46
04:11.260 --> 04:14.250
In exchange for that wish, your Soul Gem is created.

47
04:14.480 --> 04:18.480
But if you have a Soul Gem,
it would be your duty to fight witches.

48
04:19.460 --> 04:20.430
Witches?

49
04:26.030 --> 04:27.610
Um, hey Mom?

50
04:28.040 --> 04:28.620
Hm?

51
04:28.900 --> 04:30.970
This might sound silly but,

52
04:31.050 --> 04:35.500
um, if someone could grand any
wish you wanted using magic,

53
04:35.570 --> 04:36.620
what would you wish for?

54
04:36.630 --> 04:39.770
I'd wish for those two trustees to
get kicked right out of the company.

55
04:40.070 --> 04:41.190
Hehehe...

56
04:41.470 --> 04:42.530
Come to think of it,

57
04:42.930 --> 04:44.230
There's the CEO.

58
04:44.460 --> 04:48.990
He's too old to keep up the pace like he used
to, so maybe I'd wish for him to retire.

59
04:49.310 --> 04:51.600
Thing is, he hasn't named a successor yet.

60
04:53.220 --> 04:55.550
What would you do if you became the new CEO?

61
04:55.760 --> 05:00.210
Ah, how would I go about it?

62
05:01.490 --> 05:07.250
If I can get enough support from the Sales Department,
the Planning Committee and General Affairs,

63
05:07.450 --> 05:09.610
that leaves old Baldy in the Accounting.

64
05:09.900 --> 05:11.300
Interesting...

65
05:11.310 --> 05:13.990
Mom, your eyes are scary.

66
05:17.200 --> 05:18.380
What is a witch anyway?

67
05:18.580 --> 05:20.430
Are they different from magical girls?

68
05:20.690 --> 05:25.780
If magical girls are said to be born from wishes,
then witches are creatures born from curses.

69
05:26.740 --> 05:30.470
Magical girls bring hope to the
world, witches bring despair.

70
05:30.750 --> 05:34.970
And since they're invisible to humans,
they are that much more insidious.

71
05:35.380 --> 05:39.030
Anxiety and mistrust, rage and hatred...

72
05:39.330 --> 05:42.400
They sow the seeds of disaster all over the world.

73
05:42.780 --> 05:49.110
Suicides that can't be explained and murders without motive,
a witch's curse is most likely the cause of such things.

74
05:49.820 --> 05:55.080
It festers within a person,
and grows and grows until it consumes them.

75
05:55.180 --> 05:58.730
If there're things like that out there,
how come people don't know about them?

76
05:59.170 --> 06:01.890
A witch is careful about not letting humans see them.

77
06:02.120 --> 06:04.550
They hide deep within the labyrinths they create.

78
06:04.830 --> 06:06.830
You know that maze-like place you were in today?

79
06:07.240 --> 06:08.810
That was a labyrinth.

80
06:09.180 --> 06:11.380
Actually, you were both in a lot of danger.

81
06:11.890 --> 06:16.070
If a human ever wanders into one,
they seldom make it out alive.

82
06:16.220 --> 06:17.350
Is that what you do?

83
06:17.490 --> 06:19.530
You fight these horrible creatures, Mami?

84
06:19.760 --> 06:21.440
Yes, I risk my life.

85
06:22.270 --> 06:25.120
That's why the two of you should
think carefully before you decide.

86
06:25.780 --> 06:30.750
Kyubey chose you and offered a rare chance,
it's true you'll grant whatever wish you can think of.

87
06:30.950 --> 06:34.050
But remember death is part of that deal.

88
06:34.180 --> 06:35.220
Huh?

89
06:35.460 --> 06:37.320
Oh, now I'm stressed.

90
06:38.790 --> 06:40.350
I know it's a tough decision.

91
06:40.560 --> 06:44.100
But maybe if you went on a few witch hunts with
me, it'll help you decide.

92
06:44.100 --> 06:44.840
Huh?!

93
06:44.960 --> 06:47.100
See for yourselves what it's like to fight a witch.

94
06:47.640 --> 06:49.280
Think about the offer a little longer.

95
06:49.840 --> 06:51.030
Think long and hard.

96
06:51.370 --> 06:57.340
Ask yourselves, is this something you want so badly
that is worth putting your life in danger for?

97
07:01.000 --> 07:01.780
Good morning!

98
07:02.300 --> 07:03.460
Oh, good morning!

99
07:03.620 --> 07:04.650
Hey! Urgh...

100
07:04.900 --> 07:06.070
Good morning, Sayaka!

101
07:06.550 --> 07:07.420
Ugh.

102
07:07.770 --> 07:08.780
You look ill.

103
07:08.970 --> 07:09.830
Is something the matter?

104
07:10.690 --> 07:13.740
Look like we're the only ones who can see him, huh?

105
07:13.990 --> 07:14.820
I guess so.

106
07:15.610 --> 07:16.680
What are you...?

107
07:17.070 --> 07:18.360
Nah... it's nothing.

108
07:18.570 --> 07:19.660
Well, let's go!

109
07:26.720 --> 07:27.370
Huh?

110
07:40.680 --> 07:41.450
Excuse me.

111
07:41.610 --> 07:43.250
What's going on between you?

112
07:43.640 --> 07:45.590
Why do you keep staring at each other?

113
07:45.780 --> 07:47.830
Huh? Oh... Uh...

114
07:48.010 --> 07:49.250
It's...just...

115
07:49.790 --> 07:50.980
I can't believe it!

116
07:51.210 --> 07:54.110
Just by looking at each other,
you know what the other's thinking?

117
07:54.430 --> 07:58.390
Oh, for two people to become
that intimate after one night?

118
07:58.800 --> 08:00.840
What did you do after I left yesterday?

119
08:01.270 --> 08:03.190
I can't believe she's going there.

120
08:03.540 --> 08:04.830
Well, actually...

121
08:05.060 --> 08:06.810
lots of things happened but...

122
08:06.930 --> 08:08.350
That's enough! You can't be serious!

123
08:08.590 --> 08:10.030
You're both girls!

124
08:10.390 --> 08:11.540
Girls can't love girls!

125
08:11.770 --> 08:13.010
Girls can't love girls!

126
08:13.470 --> 08:15.430
Girls can't love girls...

127
08:15.790 --> 08:16.410
Hey, wait!

128
08:16.530 --> 08:17.430
You forgot your bag!

129
08:17.610 --> 08:20.420
Huh, what's wrong with her?

130
08:21.070 --> 08:22.870
Hitomi's acting just like you today.

131
08:23.300 --> 08:25.050
What the heck is that supposed to mean?!

132
08:34.850 --> 08:36.580
Are you sure this is okay?

133
08:36.920 --> 08:39.600
I mean tagging along to school and everything.

134
09:25.290 --> 09:28.250
That transfer student, you know the new girl in class?

135
09:28.340 --> 09:30.970
Is she the same as you? A magical girl?

136
09:31.570 --> 09:32.300
She is.

137
09:32.720 --> 09:33.540
There's no doubt.

138
09:33.780 --> 09:36.060
And she is a very powerful one, too.

139
09:36.200 --> 09:37.170
Then she is a good guy.

140
09:37.320 --> 09:39.690
I mean if she fights withes and stuff like you, right?

141
09:39.940 --> 09:42.770
But then, why would she do something like attack Madoka?

142
09:43.200 --> 09:44.390
It was me she was after.

143
09:44.630 --> 09:49.290
I think she was trying to keep me from
making a contract with a new magical girl.

144
09:50.710 --> 09:51.660
Yeah, but...

145
09:51.800 --> 09:55.710
If we're fighting the same enemy,
wouldn't it be better if there were more of us?

146
09:55.990 --> 09:57.440
No, not necessarily.

147
09:57.730 --> 10:00.800
It's more common for magical girls to fight each other.

148
10:01.150 --> 10:02.120
Really?

149
10:02.320 --> 10:03.280
But how come?

150
10:03.550 --> 10:06.580
When you defeat a witch, you acquire certain rewards.

151
10:06.910 --> 10:12.670
That's why, depending on the situation, magical
girls will fight, and the winner gets the reward.

152
10:13.030 --> 10:18.180
Okay, hold up, so the reason the weird transfer
student was staring at Madoka yesterday,

153
10:18.340 --> 10:21.250
was 'cause she knew Kyubey was trying to contact her?

154
10:21.950 --> 10:24.760
Most likely, yes.

155
10:46.390 --> 10:50.690
Anyway, the form of the verb we're talking
about is called the 'active voice.'

156
10:50.910 --> 10:56.110
For the ones taking notes, that's when the subject
to the sentence is doing something to the object.

157
10:56.350 --> 10:59.820
Now, the flip side of that is the 'passive voice.'

158
11:00.010 --> 11:03.720
That's when the subject to the sentence is
having something done to it by the object.

159
11:03.950 --> 11:07.700
Take a sentence, "he likes me," the subject is 'he.'

160
11:07.930 --> 11:11.470
And since he is the one doing
something, the sentence is in the act...

161
11:14.280 --> 11:15.030
Here.

162
11:18.700 --> 11:19.600
Hey, Madoka.

163
11:20.040 --> 11:22.820
You have any luck trying to figure
out what you're gonna wish for?

164
11:23.630 --> 11:24.470
Uh-uh.

165
11:24.910 --> 11:25.680
How about you?

166
11:26.240 --> 11:27.310
I don't have a clue.

167
11:27.790 --> 11:29.910
I'm totally stumped.

168
11:30.460 --> 11:33.060
I've thought about it so much
my brain is starting to hurt.

169
11:33.400 --> 11:36.950
I mean, there's a bunch of
stuff I wanna have or do, but...

170
11:37.140 --> 11:40.760
Maybe it's the risk-your-life
part, maybe that's holding me back.

171
11:41.220 --> 11:44.310
Yeah well, nothing I want's worth that
much, that's for sure.

172
11:44.380 --> 11:45.090
Mm...

173
11:45.440 --> 11:46.730
That's so odd.

174
11:47.040 --> 11:49.060
Most girls accept my offer right away.

175
11:50.300 --> 11:51.340
Then...

176
11:51.630 --> 11:53.590
I guess we don't know any better, do we?

177
11:53.910 --> 11:54.720
Really?

178
11:54.960 --> 11:55.980
Do you think so?

179
11:56.280 --> 11:58.570
Yep. We're blissfully ignorant.

180
11:59.640 --> 12:01.700
Just think about it for a sec.

181
12:01.810 --> 12:05.960
Have you ever wanted something so
bad, you'd trade your life for it?

182
12:06.350 --> 12:09.740
There's tons of people out there,
with a lot less than we have,

183
12:09.920 --> 12:11.510
who'd jump at a chance like this.

184
12:13.370 --> 12:16.590
You see, we can't figure out what to wish for,

185
12:16.730 --> 12:19.630
'cause we don't know what it's
like to want something that bad.

186
12:20.950 --> 12:23.820
We're blissfully ignorant to any kind of suffering.

187
12:25.750 --> 12:26.720
Why us?

188
12:27.100 --> 12:28.880
Why did we get this chance?

189
12:28.940 --> 12:29.690
Uh...

190
12:30.140 --> 12:31.620
It's not fair, is it?

191
12:31.970 --> 12:34.000
I get to have a wish, but you know,

192
12:34.270 --> 12:37.170
there's other people out there,
who deserved it a lot more.

193
12:37.660 --> 12:38.550
Sayaka...

194
12:57.640 --> 12:58.880
Back for more, huh?

195
12:59.330 --> 12:59.950
No.

196
13:00.360 --> 13:01.640
I haven't come to fight.

197
13:02.700 --> 13:06.520
I wanted to kill it,
before it made contact with Madoka Kaname.

198
13:06.890 --> 13:08.790
It's too late for that now.

199
13:11.220 --> 13:12.730
Well, now what?

200
13:13.480 --> 13:15.370
Are you going to become a magical girl?

201
13:15.830 --> 13:17.160
I'm, uh...

202
13:17.550 --> 13:18.350
Yeah, right.

203
13:18.580 --> 13:20.040
Like it's any of your business.

204
13:21.860 --> 13:24.500
I warned you, remember?

205
13:25.040 --> 13:25.680
Yes.

206
13:26.200 --> 13:26.980
Very well then.

207
13:27.500 --> 13:29.000
I hope my warnings aren't in vain.

208
13:29.560 --> 13:30.350
Good bye.

209
13:31.260 --> 13:32.610
H-Homura.

210
13:33.360 --> 13:34.480
Um, wait!

211
13:34.860 --> 13:38.270
I'd like to know what you wished
for when you became a magical girl.

212
13:59.180 --> 14:00.140
Hitomi!

213
14:04.610 --> 14:06.230
Oh, something private?

214
14:06.530 --> 14:07.400
Well, uh...

215
14:07.610 --> 14:08.950
I'm so jealous!

216
14:09.180 --> 14:14.490
I guess it's true what they say how two's
company, and three's a crowd!

217
14:15.420 --> 14:18.380
You got it all wrong, again...

218
14:20.240 --> 14:21.220
Miss Akemi,

219
14:21.370 --> 14:24.200
We're going for coffee after school, wanna come with us?

220
14:24.430 --> 14:25.510
Not today.

221
14:25.760 --> 14:27.300
I've got some stuff to do.

222
14:27.520 --> 14:28.590
I'm sorry.

223
14:28.860 --> 14:30.110
Aww.

224
14:34.290 --> 14:37.910
Well, time to start Lesson One
of the Magical Girl Experience.

225
14:38.250 --> 14:39.910
That's what I'd like to call it, anyway.

226
14:40.220 --> 14:41.800
I hope you're ready.

227
14:42.210 --> 14:44.010
I don't know if it'll make a difference but...

228
14:44.190 --> 14:45.750
I brought this!

229
14:48.520 --> 14:50.690
I mean it's better than not having anything, right?

230
14:51.030 --> 14:54.620
Well, let's say I'm glad you're
going into it with that spirit.

231
14:54.830 --> 14:55.600
How about you?

232
14:55.810 --> 14:56.560
What'd you bring?

233
14:56.830 --> 14:57.470
Huh?

234
14:57.760 --> 14:58.490
Nothing...

235
14:58.890 --> 14:59.600
Just this.

236
15:04.610 --> 15:05.560
Ooh...

237
15:06.730 --> 15:11.160
I-I sort of thought...it'd be good to
have some costume ideas just in case.

238
15:11.570 --> 15:13.580
Ha ha ha...!

239
15:12.450 --> 15:13.430
Huh?

240
15:18.000 --> 15:19.770
Well, you certainly have the right spirit.

241
15:20.030 --> 15:21.030
That's so awesome!

242
15:21.230 --> 15:22.530
I can't top that!

243
15:22.630 --> 15:24.200
Ha ha ha!

244
15:30.110 --> 15:32.840
It senses the magic residuals
of the witch we saw yesterday.

245
15:33.220 --> 15:36.060
When we hunt, we have to scout the city by foot.

246
15:36.340 --> 15:40.180
Once your Soul Gem picks up a trail,
follow it until you find the witch.

247
15:40.650 --> 15:41.470
Really?

248
15:41.580 --> 15:42.540
That's it, huh?

249
15:48.170 --> 15:49.000
What now?

250
15:49.170 --> 15:50.810
Your Gem's not going any brighter.

251
15:51.050 --> 15:53.940
That's because it's been a whole
day since the witch escaped.

252
15:54.240 --> 15:56.070
The trail has almost faded away.

253
15:56.330 --> 15:59.110
Then, if you'd gone after it right away last night...

254
15:59.390 --> 16:01.260
I might have been able to finish it off.

255
16:01.690 --> 16:05.310
But I would've had to leave the two of
you alone and I didn't wanna risk it.

256
16:06.920 --> 16:07.820
I'm sorry.

257
16:08.000 --> 16:08.950
It's fine.

258
16:09.380 --> 16:11.980
Yep! You really are an ally of justice, Mami.

259
16:12.330 --> 16:13.770
Not like that psycho.

260
16:14.190 --> 16:15.260
What's her deal anyway?!

261
16:15.390 --> 16:16.600
She really pisses me off!

262
16:34.720 --> 16:35.700
Hey, Mami.

263
16:35.940 --> 16:39.420
When you're tracking a witch,
do you look any place special for them?

264
16:39.700 --> 16:44.050
Sometimes you'll find traces of
witches' auras about fatal car crashes.

265
16:44.340 --> 16:46.300
So I check streets with heavy traffic.

266
16:46.580 --> 16:49.860
Then the Red Light District,
where fights usually break out.

267
16:50.080 --> 16:54.160
Also I check places people go to commit suicide.

268
16:55.740 --> 16:59.190
Then I check the hospitals,
the worst place for a witch to hide.

269
16:59.670 --> 17:05.250
It's unbearable to see them draining the life force
from a helpless person, who's already weak from illness.

270
17:09.250 --> 17:11.310
It's picked up some powerful magic.

271
17:13.840 --> 17:14.730
It's close.

272
17:22.870 --> 17:24.040
There's no mistake.

273
17:24.270 --> 17:25.200
It's here!

274
17:25.940 --> 17:26.910
Look up there!

275
17:29.540 --> 17:30.490
Ha!

276
17:47.450 --> 17:48.610
A Witch's Kiss.

277
17:49.290 --> 17:50.090
I knew it.

278
17:52.200 --> 17:52.980
Is she dead?

279
17:53.260 --> 17:54.020
She's okay.

280
17:54.280 --> 17:55.490
She just fainted, is all.

281
17:56.590 --> 17:57.400
Let's go!

282
18:11.060 --> 18:12.420
You won't escape this time.

283
18:15.530 --> 18:16.390
Whoa, look at that!

284
18:16.520 --> 18:17.420
Oh, wow!

285
18:18.390 --> 18:19.540
It's not much, I know.

286
18:19.860 --> 18:22.270
But it'll help you fight off
anything that tries to attack.

287
18:23.160 --> 18:25.060
Stay close to me once we're inside, okay?

288
18:25.470 --> 18:26.500
'Kay!

289
18:45.020 --> 18:45.710
Get back!

290
18:46.070 --> 18:46.960
Get back!

291
18:48.300 --> 18:49.010
How about it?

292
18:49.280 --> 18:50.440
Are the two of you scared?

293
18:51.290 --> 18:52.390
Yeah, as if.

294
19:11.180 --> 19:12.090
Keep going.

295
19:12.230 --> 19:14.200
We're almost at the center of the labyrinth.

296
19:38.330 --> 19:38.890
Look.

297
19:39.110 --> 19:40.130
That is a witch.

298
19:42.410 --> 19:44.610
Eww... Gross!

299
19:45.040 --> 19:45.750
It's awful!

300
19:46.000 --> 19:47.740
Are you really gonna fight it?

301
19:48.020 --> 19:48.960
I'll be fine.

302
19:49.160 --> 19:50.750
I could never lose.

303
19:55.630 --> 19:56.810
Stay back! Don't move!

304
20:37.130 --> 20:37.820
Oh, no!

305
20:39.410 --> 20:40.310
Mami!

306
20:42.940 --> 20:43.670
I'm okay.

307
20:44.060 --> 20:48.810
I can't let myself look uncool in
front of my magical girls trainees!

308
21:02.070 --> 21:03.450
Let's wrap this up.

309
21:10.470 --> 21:12.400
<i>Tiro Finale!</i>

310
21:28.190 --> 21:29.520
So, you won?

311
21:29.530 --> 21:30.450
Awesome!

312
21:39.780 --> 21:41.220
This is a Grief Seed.

313
21:41.550 --> 21:42.670
It's a witch's egg.

314
21:43.080 --> 21:43.740
An egg?

315
21:44.030 --> 21:45.570
Witches will carry them sometimes.

316
21:45.750 --> 21:48.020
If you're lucky you'll find one after a battle.

317
21:48.450 --> 21:51.120
Don't worry. When they're like
that, they're perfectly safe.

318
21:51.580 --> 21:53.960
In fact, they're valuable because of what they do.

319
21:55.060 --> 21:58.730
The color of my Soul Gem looks staler
than it did last night, doesn't it?

320
21:59.000 --> 21:59.780
It does.

321
22:00.000 --> 22:02.340
But, if I do this with the Grief Seed...

322
22:03.100 --> 22:03.970
See?

323
22:05.680 --> 22:07.570
Wow! It cleared right up.

324
22:08.320 --> 22:09.070
Uh-huh.

325
22:09.660 --> 22:12.090
And the magic I used during the
fight has been restored, too.

326
22:12.660 --> 22:14.360
Remember those rewards that I talked about?

327
22:14.780 --> 22:15.490
This is it.

328
22:21.840 --> 22:24.430
It should be good for at least one more use.

329
22:26.340 --> 22:27.270
Take it!

330
22:27.470 --> 22:28.570
I'm giving it to you.

331
22:29.500 --> 22:30.870
Miss Homura Akemi.

332
22:31.290 --> 22:32.260
Her again.

333
22:33.830 --> 22:34.570
Hmm...

334
22:34.840 --> 22:37.050
Maybe you're not the sharing-with-others type.

335
22:37.460 --> 22:38.450
It was your kill.

336
22:39.380 --> 22:41.030
So, keep the reward for yourself.

337
22:43.740 --> 22:44.460
Fine.

338
22:45.090 --> 22:46.970
If that's what you want, so be it.

339
22:51.400 --> 22:52.280
Seriously!

340
22:52.600 --> 22:54.130
She bugs the hell out of me!

341
22:54.260 --> 22:56.250
But why can't we be friends with her?

342
22:56.450 --> 22:59.140
She has to want to be friends, right?

343
23:04.610 --> 23:05.590
What the...

344
23:05.940 --> 23:06.440
Huh?

345
23:06.750 --> 23:07.840
Where am I?

346
23:09.110 --> 23:11.250
Ah! I... Oh, god!

347
23:11.570 --> 23:12.150
No...

348
23:12.350 --> 23:12.900
I just...

349
23:13.100 --> 23:13.880
I just...

350
23:14.280 --> 23:16.340
I jumped but I don't know why...

351
23:16.160 --> 23:17.150
It's okay.

352
23:17.340 --> 23:18.450
Don't worry. You're safe now.

353
23:19.120 --> 23:19.930
See?

354
23:20.360 --> 23:22.340
You were just having a nightmare, is all.

355
23:23.400 --> 23:24.590
Well, I guess that's it.

356
23:24.980 --> 23:26.030
Case closed, huh?

357
23:26.520 --> 23:27.200
Mm-hm.

358
14:00.510 --> 14:04.620
Hey, sorry but we sort of have a
couple of errands to run, so...

359
25:25.910 --> 25:27.420
I just pretend to be cool.

360
25:27.760 --> 25:30.530
When I'm scared or hurt, there is no one I can talk to.

361
25:30.960 --> 25:32.980
All I can do is cry on my own.

362
25:33.620 --> 25:34.430
It's not fun...

363
25:34.960 --> 25:36.440
...being a magical girl.

364
25:37.370 --> 25:39.310
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

365
02:45.140 --> 02:46.840
<i>People really can't see him.</i>

366
07:22.970 --> 07:26.390
<i>We can communicate like this,
just by thinking to each other.</i>

367
07:27.540 --> 07:29.440
<i>You mean we already have magical powers?</i>

368
07:29.650 --> 07:30.350
<i>For reals?</i>

369
07:30.710 --> 07:31.760
<i>No, not yet.</i>

370
07:32.010 --> 07:34.460
<i>I'm letting you communicate your thoughts through me.</i>

371
07:35.110 --> 07:37.040
<i>But it's kind of a handy trick, don't you think?</i>

372
07:37.810 --> 07:40.270
<i>It feels sort of...weird.</i>

373
08:39.860 --> 08:40.680
<i>Why not?</i>

374
08:40.920 --> 08:45.510
<i>That psycho chick who was trying to kill
you yesterday just transferred to our class.</i>

375
08:45.810 --> 08:48.020
<i>You're sort of risking your life being here.</i>

376
08:48.290 --> 08:51.150
<i>Actually, I think the school is the safest place for me.</i>

377
08:51.340 --> 08:52.520
<i>Besides, Mami's here.</i>

378
08:52.720 --> 08:56.090
<i>Mami's a 9th grader,
she's way over on the other side of school.</i>

379
08:56.360 --> 08:59.410
<i>Don't worry, I can hear all of you perfectly.</i>

380
08:59.750 --> 09:02.920
<i>She's not that far, so my telepathy can still reach her.</i>

381
09:03.170 --> 09:06.220
<i>Oh, uh, um, good morning!</i>

382
09:07.500 --> 09:09.680
<i>I promise I'll keep a close watch over you.</i>

383
09:09.810 --> 09:13.830
<i>Besides, she doesn't seem like the
type who would attack you in public.</i>

384
09:14.070 --> 09:15.180
<i>If you say so...</i>

385
09:16.930 --> 09:19.430
<i>Ugh... Speak of the devil.</i>

386
10:29.560 --> 10:30.580
<i>Don't worry, Madoka.</i>

387
10:31.440 --> 10:35.360
<i>If she steps out of line and tries anything
funny, I'll punch her lights out.</i>

388
10:35.730 --> 10:37.520
<i>Besides, Mami's got our back.</i>

389
10:37.740 --> 10:38.460
<i>That's right.</i>

390
10:38.750 --> 10:40.590
<i>I'm here, so everything will be fine.</i>

391
10:41.160 --> 10:43.170
<i>Regardless of Sayaka and her punches.</i>

392
10:43.740 --> 10:45.260
<i>What do you mean 'regardless?'</i>

393
12:46.390 --> 12:47.270
<i>It's okay.</i>

394
16:19.580 --> 16:20.640
<i>I wonder...</i>

395
16:21.030 --> 16:23.050
<i>Is she really a bad person...?</i>

396
19:06.010 --> 19:06.860
<i>I'm scared...</i>

397
19:07.330 --> 19:08.070
<i>But...</i>

398
23:28.230 --> 23:32.110
<i>It's still really hard for me
to figure out what I'd wish for.</i>

399
23:32.460 --> 23:35.270
<i>It's not something I can put my finger on that easily.</i>

400
23:35.810 --> 23:38.550
<i>But Mami tries so hard to save people.</i>

401
23:38.780 --> 23:41.300
<i>She looks so amazing doing it, too.</i>

402
23:41.670 --> 23:46.890
<i>If someone like me could do that,
go around helping people who're in trouble?</i>

403
23:47.040 --> 23:49.890
<i>Well, I think that would be...</i>

404
23:50.720 --> 23:52.980
<i>...truly wonderful.</i>
