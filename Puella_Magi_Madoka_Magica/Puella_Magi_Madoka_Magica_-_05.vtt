00:00.000 --> 00:00.000


2
00:11.410 --> 00:14.420
You're sure you can grant any wish, for real?

3
00:14.630 --> 00:15.610
You don't have to worry.

4
00:15.890 --> 00:18.250
I can grant yours without any problem.

5
00:19.930 --> 00:20.870
So...

6
00:21.110 --> 00:21.950
Are you ready?

7
00:22.300 --> 00:22.900
Yeah.

8
00:23.290 --> 00:24.250
Do it.

9
00:47.130 --> 00:47.950
There...

10
00:48.630 --> 00:49.430
Accept it.

11
00:51.560 --> 00:53.990
This is your destiny.

12
02:36.080 --> 02:37.680
Oh, excuse me.

13
02:38.470 --> 02:39.830
That was terribly rude.

14
02:40.030 --> 02:40.900
What's up, Hitomi?

15
02:41.120 --> 02:42.190
Didn't you get enough sleep?

16
02:42.440 --> 02:43.270
I didn't.

17
02:43.410 --> 02:46.910
I was up really late talking to the police
and getting checked out at the hospital.

18
02:47.060 --> 02:47.710
Really?

19
02:47.850 --> 02:48.700
What happened?

20
02:49.000 --> 02:51.940
Well, apparently,
I was sleepwalking or some such thing...

21
02:52.350 --> 02:55.050
Oh, but there were several
others who had the same symptoms.

22
02:55.450 --> 02:58.990
And when we all woke up and found
ourselves in a strange place together.

23
02:58.990 --> 03:00.450
Oh, what's up with that?

24
03:00.970 --> 03:04.230
The doctor said we most likely
suffered a mass hallucination.

25
03:04.560 --> 03:08.210
So, after school today,
I have to go back to the hospital for more tests.

26
03:08.840 --> 03:10.910
Ohh, it's such a bother.

27
03:11.620 --> 03:14.300
After going through that,
you shouldn't have come to school today.

28
03:14.580 --> 03:15.680
I couldn't do that.

29
03:15.930 --> 03:18.410
If I stayed home, then everyone would think I was sick.

30
03:18.650 --> 03:21.560
I don't want my parents to worry
about me more than they already are.

31
03:21.670 --> 03:23.320
Spoken like a true honored student.

32
03:23.470 --> 03:24.350
That's our girl!

33
03:35.280 --> 03:37.760
I haven't felt this good in a long time.

34
03:38.240 --> 03:39.570
I feel awesome!

35
03:40.770 --> 03:41.700
Sayaka.

36
03:42.140 --> 03:43.720
Aren't you scared?

37
03:44.190 --> 03:44.990
Huh?

38
03:45.130 --> 03:47.020
Well, I guess I am a little.

39
03:47.500 --> 03:49.770
I mean it wasn't too hard to beat that witch.

40
03:50.730 --> 03:53.250
I gotta admit, it was kinda easy.

41
03:53.730 --> 03:57.060
Yeah, but if I start thinking about
how I could've lost you and Hitomi,

42
03:58.110 --> 04:00.660
man, that scares me way more.

43
04:01.060 --> 04:03.260
So, how do I really feel?

44
04:03.730 --> 04:06.580
I feel sort of, confident,

45
04:07.050 --> 04:08.190
more at ease.

46
04:08.430 --> 04:11.020
I kinda feel like I wanna congratulate myself, too.

47
04:12.120 --> 04:15.380
Anyway, I'm excited about this, seriously.

48
04:16.160 --> 04:20.040
From now on, I promise that
I - Magical Girl Sayaka

49
04:20.230 --> 04:23.280
- will do my best to protect
the peace of Mitakihara City!

50
04:24.560 --> 04:26.630
Are you sure you don't have any regrets?

51
04:27.860 --> 04:28.900
I guess...

52
04:29.090 --> 04:33.970
if I had to pick one,
it'd be that I waited as long as I did.

53
04:35.730 --> 04:39.880
But in the end, I did it anyway,
so I should've made up my mind sooner.

54
04:40.630 --> 04:45.010
If I was a magical girl when Mami
fought that witch, I could've helped.

55
04:45.640 --> 04:47.470
Then maybe she'd still be alive.

56
04:48.540 --> 04:49.610
Maybe...

57
04:59.780 --> 05:02.590
Hey, you're not thinking what I
think you're thinking, are you?

58
05:03.240 --> 05:04.350
I...

59
05:05.000 --> 05:06.360
Maybe I should have...

60
05:06.360 --> 05:08.270
Don't you start going "could have, should have."

61
05:08.450 --> 05:09.810
Hindsight's twenty-twenty.

62
05:10.090 --> 05:12.400
I feel like I was meant to be a magical girl.

63
05:12.690 --> 05:15.750
So I shouldn't have dragged my feet
about her for as long as I did.

64
05:16.360 --> 05:17.590
Sayaka...

65
05:19.350 --> 05:21.490
I knew what I wanted more than anything else.

66
05:21.990 --> 05:24.840
Never meant to have to risk my life fighting witches.

67
05:25.040 --> 05:26.010
So what?

68
05:26.170 --> 05:27.460
I would've wished for it anyway.

69
05:28.190 --> 05:31.230
It took a long time to realize how much that wish meant.

70
05:31.610 --> 05:33.330
So that's a little frustrating.

71
05:37.170 --> 05:39.960
So, after all that, my point is don't feel guilty.

72
05:40.260 --> 05:42.990
It's okay if you don't wanna be a magical girl, too.

73
05:43.840 --> 05:45.930
Maybe you just weren't meant for it.

74
05:49.430 --> 05:52.850
Anyway, I'd better get going, I'm gonna be late.

75
05:53.700 --> 05:55.320
Do you have something important to do?

76
05:55.740 --> 05:57.300
Yeah, sort of.

77
06:01.210 --> 06:01.970
Really?

78
06:02.130 --> 06:03.600
Why aren't they letting you go home yet?

79
06:04.080 --> 06:06.340
I still have to finish the rehab for my legs.

80
06:06.670 --> 06:09.490
So, I can't really do anything until I can walk again.

81
06:10.190 --> 06:14.260
Plus, everyone's still wondering how
my hand healed as fast as it did.

82
06:14.560 --> 06:15.870
They're concerned about it.

83
06:16.850 --> 06:20.280
The doctors wanna run some more
tests on it to find out what that is.

84
06:23.080 --> 06:24.740
How are you feeling now, Kyosuke?

85
06:25.150 --> 06:27.420
I mean, do you have any pain anywhere?

86
06:27.800 --> 06:30.540
No, I feel so good, it's scary.

87
06:30.980 --> 06:34.680
I was thinking about it,
the accident almost seems like a bad dream now.

88
06:35.010 --> 06:35.920
It's weird.

89
06:36.120 --> 06:38.280
I wonder what I'm even doing in this bed.

90
06:39.670 --> 06:41.390
It's just like you said, Sayaka.

91
06:41.510 --> 06:42.660
It's a miracle.

92
06:47.180 --> 06:47.870
Hm?

93
06:48.000 --> 06:48.890
What's wrong?

94
06:49.190 --> 06:52.150
The other day, I said some awful things.

95
06:52.440 --> 06:54.620
I was really upset and it was wrong.

96
06:54.740 --> 06:55.940
Forget about that stuff.

97
06:56.070 --> 06:57.000
It's no big deal.

98
06:57.370 --> 07:00.580
Your hand's working again.
You should be totally happy about that.

99
07:00.890 --> 07:01.980
So, don't make that face.

100
07:02.490 --> 07:03.190
Right...

101
07:03.720 --> 07:05.640
I guess it still feels like a dream.

102
07:05.980 --> 07:06.680
Yeah.

103
07:06.810 --> 07:07.940
Well, I'm not surprised.

104
07:09.540 --> 07:11.490
Oh, it's about time.

105
07:12.520 --> 07:13.090
Hm?

106
07:13.260 --> 07:16.210
Well, how about you and me go out for some fresh air?

107
07:18.150 --> 07:19.950
Why are you taking me up to the roof?

108
07:20.160 --> 07:21.600
Don't worry. You'll see.

109
07:42.440 --> 07:43.880
What's going on?

110
07:44.250 --> 07:46.860
We were going to have a party
when you got out of the hospital.

111
07:47.020 --> 07:49.280
But we figured since your hand's all better.

112
07:50.020 --> 07:51.390
I-Is that?

113
07:52.020 --> 07:54.350
I know you told me to get rid of it, but...

114
07:54.560 --> 07:56.670
I-I just couldn't throw it away.

115
07:59.410 --> 08:00.420
Take it, Son.

116
08:14.770 --> 08:15.490
Go on.

117
08:15.660 --> 08:16.600
Play something.

118
08:17.030 --> 08:18.260
You don't have to be afraid.

119
08:21.560 --> 08:22.210
'Kay...

120
09:43.240 --> 09:44.960
Huh...

121
09:46.730 --> 09:49.690
So, that's what the new magical girl in town looks like.

122
09:51.410 --> 09:53.940
You're not really going to
pick a fight with her, are you?

123
09:54.700 --> 09:55.740
Sure, why not?

124
09:56.070 --> 09:57.410
She won't know what hit her.

125
09:57.520 --> 09:58.310
I promise.

126
09:58.830 --> 09:59.760
Why? What's up?

127
10:02.550 --> 10:04.430
You got a problem with that or something?

128
10:04.880 --> 10:05.500
Not at all.

129
10:05.910 --> 10:07.680
But it might not be as easy as you think.

130
10:08.360 --> 10:11.160
There is another magical girl in the city after all.

131
10:11.390 --> 10:13.220
Oh, really?

132
10:13.680 --> 10:15.050
So, what's her story?

133
10:15.290 --> 10:16.900
I'm not really sure about that.

134
10:17.180 --> 10:17.840
Huh?

135
10:18.030 --> 10:19.300
You gotta be kidding.

136
10:19.530 --> 10:22.910
If she's a magical girl, then she had
to've made a contract with you, right?

137
10:23.190 --> 10:25.930
You could say yes.
You could also say no.

138
10:26.880 --> 10:29.010
She's an irregularity in this world.

139
10:29.280 --> 10:32.090
And I have absolutely no idea what she's capable of.

140
10:32.790 --> 10:34.620
Hmpf. Sounds good to me!

141
10:35.130 --> 10:36.890
Gettin' kinda boring around here, anyway.

142
10:38.060 --> 10:40.090
Gotta shake things up.
You know what I'm saying?

143
10:49.980 --> 10:51.240
You wanted to talk?

144
10:52.750 --> 10:55.110
Um...it's about Sayaka.

145
10:55.970 --> 10:56.840
And well...

146
10:58.530 --> 11:00.250
She might be stubborn, and...

147
11:00.490 --> 11:02.770
...maybe a little hypersensitive too...

148
11:03.340 --> 11:06.100
And maybe she kind of likes to argue a lot...

149
11:06.380 --> 11:08.550
but she really is a wonderful person!

150
11:09.000 --> 11:10.680
She's kind hearted and brave,

151
11:10.880 --> 11:13.300
and she's always ready to help someone if they need it.

152
11:13.500 --> 11:15.480
Those're fatal flaws for magical girls.

153
11:16.080 --> 11:18.330
Oh...really?

154
11:19.650 --> 11:22.350
A person becomes naïve if they're too kind.

155
11:22.820 --> 11:24.300
Careless if they're too bold.

156
11:24.600 --> 11:28.670
And no matter how hard you try to protect
others, there's no gratitude.

157
11:29.600 --> 11:32.910
Those who can't comprehend such
things aren't fit to be magical girls.

158
11:33.850 --> 11:36.860
That's the reason why Mami Tomoe lost her life.

159
11:39.080 --> 11:40.750
Don't talk about her that way!

160
11:43.360 --> 11:47.410
Anyway, Sayaka, she says she'll be okay on her own.

161
11:47.660 --> 11:52.230
But then, when I think about Mami and how
the same thing could happen to her, I...

162
11:52.900 --> 11:53.820
just...

163
11:54.030 --> 11:55.300
I don't know what to do.

164
11:56.120 --> 11:58.040
You're really worried about her, aren't you?

165
11:58.530 --> 11:59.230
Mm-hm.

166
12:00.100 --> 12:00.890
I am.

167
12:01.250 --> 12:03.950
But I can't do anything to help her all by myself.

168
12:04.480 --> 12:07.400
So I was hoping I could ask you to help her.

169
12:08.160 --> 12:09.870
Please be friends with Sayaka.

170
12:10.540 --> 12:12.840
And please don't fight with her like you did with Mami.

171
12:13.230 --> 12:17.340
If everyone can work together,
then when you go out to fight witches,

172
12:17.480 --> 12:19.230
it'll be a lot safer for everyone.

173
12:26.810 --> 12:28.670
I don't make a habit of telling lies.

174
12:28.950 --> 12:31.250
And I don't make promises that I can't keep.

175
12:31.710 --> 12:32.360
Uh?

176
12:32.640 --> 12:36.170
Therefore, you should forget about Sayaka Miki.

177
12:41.340 --> 12:42.630
Why should I..?

178
12:43.130 --> 12:45.880
She shouldn't have been allowed to make the contract.

179
12:46.090 --> 12:47.550
I'm partly to blame for it.

180
12:48.320 --> 12:49.210
I'll admit that.

181
12:49.780 --> 12:52.030
I should have looked out for her, as I do for you.

182
12:53.200 --> 12:54.110
Then she...

183
12:54.950 --> 12:57.400
although I'm partly to blame, you must understand.

184
12:57.920 --> 13:01.050
This is a mistake which she can neither
undo, nor recover from,

185
13:01.490 --> 13:04.300
the same as how the dead can never return to life.

186
13:07.000 --> 13:11.100
Once you become a magical girl,
there is no turning back.

187
13:12.250 --> 13:13.860
When we decide to make a contract,

188
13:14.180 --> 13:17.800
we give everything up in exchange for
one single wish.

189
13:19.140 --> 13:22.430
But then, does that mean you've given up, Homura?

190
13:23.100 --> 13:26.600
On all the other girls, even on yourself, for real?

191
13:27.650 --> 13:28.300
Yes.

192
13:29.270 --> 13:31.330
I won't make any excuses for myself.

193
13:32.050 --> 13:36.650
No matter what sins I must bear,
I will continue my fight to the end.

194
13:43.570 --> 13:46.730
If I'd wasted your time, I'm sorry.

195
14:12.650 --> 14:13.540
Madoka?

196
14:14.050 --> 14:14.760
Sayaka.

197
14:15.380 --> 14:17.140
Are you going...?

198
14:17.380 --> 14:20.050
Yep!
Time to patrol for wicked witches!

199
14:20.400 --> 14:22.960
It's my duty.
Now that I'm an ally of justice.

200
14:23.610 --> 14:25.630
Are you okay by yourself?

201
14:26.410 --> 14:27.690
Oh, I'll be fine.

202
14:27.930 --> 14:29.380
Hey, Mami worked alone, too.

203
14:29.770 --> 14:31.490
And if she can do it, then so can I!

204
14:32.100 --> 14:35.230
Um, I know...I don't have any powers,

205
14:35.480 --> 14:38.380
and I guess I'll probably end
up just getting in your way,

206
14:38.760 --> 14:39.630
But if...

207
14:40.570 --> 14:42.250
if you don't mind having me around,

208
14:43.140 --> 14:44.490
I'd like come with you.

209
14:45.070 --> 14:46.990
At least as far as you can take me.

210
14:49.720 --> 14:50.960
You're so stubborn.

211
14:51.980 --> 14:52.670
Sorry,

212
14:53.040 --> 14:56.150
it's a lot to ask,
but I figured I'd give it a shot.

213
14:57.010 --> 14:58.950
No, I'm happy you did.

214
15:00.940 --> 15:01.950
You feel that?

215
15:02.320 --> 15:03.860
My hands are totally shaking.

216
15:04.180 --> 15:05.820
They haven't stopped this whole time.

217
15:06.230 --> 15:07.490
Isn't that pathetic?

218
15:07.790 --> 15:11.830
Even though I'm a magical girl,
the thought of going alone's kinda scary.

219
15:12.190 --> 15:13.290
Sayaka...

220
15:13.730 --> 15:14.830
I want you to come.

221
15:15.040 --> 15:16.050
It'd make me happy.

222
15:16.550 --> 15:20.150
I already feel way braver now,
knowing you're gonna with me!

223
15:20.490 --> 15:22.500
I could beat up 100 bad guys now!

224
15:23.050 --> 15:24.130
But what if...

225
15:24.360 --> 15:25.430
I'll keep you safe.

226
15:25.610 --> 15:27.400
Just follow my leading, you'll be okay.

227
15:27.560 --> 15:28.340
I promise.

228
15:28.660 --> 15:31.370
Ready to go hunt some witches now,
just like we used to?

229
15:31.690 --> 15:32.320
Mm-hm.

230
15:34.290 --> 15:36.420
You know this is going to be dangerous, right?

231
15:36.680 --> 15:37.280
Mm.

232
15:37.840 --> 15:38.880
You know how I am.

233
15:39.140 --> 15:41.840
If I went alone, I'd be reckless and get myself killed.

234
15:42.110 --> 15:44.370
But if Madoka's there, I won't act stupid.

235
15:44.580 --> 15:46.540
I think about what I'm doing, and be more focused.

236
15:46.780 --> 15:47.430
You see?

237
15:47.690 --> 15:48.470
Mm.

238
15:48.660 --> 15:50.600
Well, as long as you've thought it through.

239
15:51.120 --> 15:52.210
Kyubey...

240
16:36.900 --> 16:37.580
This is it.

241
16:40.380 --> 16:44.010
This labyrinth was probably the
creation of a familiar, not a witch.

242
16:44.460 --> 16:46.240
I should still be careful though.

243
16:46.580 --> 16:48.160
After all, I'm still new at this.

244
16:48.640 --> 16:49.810
Keep your guard up.

245
16:50.570 --> 16:51.320
Roger that.

246
17:01.810 --> 17:02.870
Here it is!

247
17:03.050 --> 17:03.770
What do we do?

248
17:03.780 --> 17:04.370
I got it.

249
17:32.640 --> 17:33.760
Hang on a sec.

250
17:33.930 --> 17:35.980
What do you think you're doing?
Playing tag?

251
17:38.200 --> 17:39.740
Uh, it's getting away!

252
17:42.630 --> 17:43.930
What are you? Blind or something?

253
17:44.310 --> 17:45.990
That is no witch, it's a familiar.

254
17:46.180 --> 17:48.230
And you ain't gonna have any Grief Seeds on it.

255
17:48.400 --> 17:49.130
Yeah, I know.

256
17:49.410 --> 17:52.270
But if we leave it alone,
it's gonna go and kill someone!

257
17:54.880 --> 17:55.740
Listen, Chick.

258
17:56.060 --> 17:59.830
It's gotta eat 4 or 5 people
before it turns into a witch.

259
18:00.030 --> 18:03.130
Then, when you kill it,
you're sure to get a Grief Seed out of the deal.

260
18:03.440 --> 18:07.140
You don't wanna kill the goose before
it laid the golden eggs, Rookie?

261
18:08.170 --> 18:10.190
What about the people it's gonna attack?

262
18:10.360 --> 18:11.250
Seriously?

263
18:11.510 --> 18:12.840
You're gonna let them get killed?!

264
18:13.850 --> 18:14.750
You know what?

265
18:14.960 --> 18:17.400
Hate to say it, but you've got this whole thing wrong.

266
18:17.640 --> 18:19.850
Ever hear of something called the food chain?

267
18:19.990 --> 18:21.390
Didn't they teach you it in school?

268
18:22.310 --> 18:24.690
The witches go and eat weak humans.

269
18:24.800 --> 18:27.070
And then we hunt them down and eat the witches.

270
18:28.410 --> 18:30.300
It's the natural way of things.

271
18:30.550 --> 18:32.780
The weak have to give up to the strong.

272
18:35.110 --> 18:35.890
Oh, no...

273
18:38.510 --> 18:39.320
Why you...

274
18:39.790 --> 18:41.010
Oh, don't tell me...

275
18:41.510 --> 18:46.070
You don't really believe in all that "saving
people" and "fighting for justice" crap, do you?

276
18:47.240 --> 18:51.240
Come on now, you didn't buy that load of bull, did ya?

277
18:51.520 --> 18:53.090
And what if I did, huh?!

278
18:59.610 --> 19:00.710
Whatever.

279
19:01.140 --> 19:02.080
Wanna stop that?

280
19:13.290 --> 19:15.930
I don't like you're coming here
and acting like it's a game.

281
19:16.600 --> 19:17.900
That pisses me off.

282
19:26.730 --> 19:27.490
Sayaka!

283
19:28.610 --> 19:30.000
Hmph! Rookie.

284
19:30.800 --> 19:32.640
Go cool your head for a while.

285
19:38.290 --> 19:39.650
You gotta be kidding.

286
19:39.880 --> 19:43.770
The hit you took should've put you in
the hospital for at least three months.

287
19:44.060 --> 19:45.740
Kyubey, is she okay?

288
19:46.060 --> 19:50.350
She wished for someone to be healed when she
made her contract to become a magical girl.

289
19:50.700 --> 19:53.200
So now, she has the power to heal fast.

290
19:53.640 --> 19:56.660
Think you're so tough, don't you?

291
19:57.380 --> 20:00.110
Mami's gone because of magical girls like you!

292
20:00.970 --> 20:01.930
Okay.

293
20:03.550 --> 20:05.370
That really pisses me off!

294
20:07.550 --> 20:08.750
You know something?

295
20:09.050 --> 20:10.630
You shouldn't talk to me like that.

296
20:10.870 --> 20:13.160
I've been doing this thing way longer than you.

297
20:13.760 --> 20:14.790
Shut up!

298
20:19.940 --> 20:23.320
Gonna jump around all day,
or are you gonna fight back?

299
20:26.800 --> 20:27.610
Sayaka!

300
20:28.570 --> 20:29.460
It's too dangerous!

301
20:33.450 --> 20:35.260
You don't get it when I explain it.

302
20:35.570 --> 20:38.390
And trying to beat some sense
into you ain't really working.

303
20:39.660 --> 20:42.420
Guess my only option is to kill ya!

304
20:49.870 --> 20:50.930
I won't lose...

305
20:54.630 --> 20:56.040
Not to you!

306
21:09.470 --> 21:10.230
Why?

307
21:11.090 --> 21:12.270
Why is this happening?

308
21:12.860 --> 21:13.790
She's not a witch.

309
21:14.240 --> 21:16.860
They're magical girls,
they shouldn't be fighting each other!

310
21:17.480 --> 21:18.590
It can't be helped.

311
21:19.100 --> 21:20.810
Neither of them is willing to back down.

312
21:23.850 --> 21:24.800
Please, Kyubey...

313
21:25.130 --> 21:26.020
Make them stop!

314
21:26.530 --> 21:27.590
This is crazy!

315
21:27.860 --> 21:29.150
There's nothing I can do.

316
21:29.770 --> 21:30.660
However...

317
21:31.010 --> 21:34.890
If you wanna stop them and you don't
mind using force, there is a way.

318
21:37.310 --> 21:40.380
Only another magical girl could come between them now.

319
21:41.310 --> 21:45.550
And you're more than qualified to become
one, if you really want to.

320
21:53.770 --> 21:54.740
Game over!

321
22:01.440 --> 22:02.290
I wish...

322
22:02.290 --> 22:03.640
There's no need for that.

323
23:56.300 --> 24:00.800
But Sayaka, you became a magical girl
so you can fight witches, didn't you?

324
24:01.390 --> 24:02.470
She isn't a witch.

325
24:02.770 --> 24:04.870
She's a magical girl just like you.

326
24:06.280 --> 24:08.360
This just can't be right.

327
12:54.000 --> 12:54.860
But...

328
20:27.150 --> 20:28.220
No, Madoka.

329
09:00.040 --> 09:00.970
<i>Hey, Mami.</i>

330
09:01.670 --> 09:02.600
<i>See that?</i>

331
09:03.570 --> 09:04.900
<i>My wish has been granted.</i>

332
09:06.100 --> 09:08.470
<i>There's no way I'll ever regret it.</i>

333
09:10.740 --> 09:15.240
<i>And right now, this is the happiest moment of my life.</i>

334
14:02.420 --> 14:03.310
<i>Are you nervous?</i>

335
14:04.570 --> 14:05.320
<i>A little.</i>

336
14:05.760 --> 14:07.740
<i>One mistake and it's goodbye me.</i>

337
15:52.900 --> 15:57.190
<i>You've thought this through as
well, haven't you, Madoka?</i>

338
15:57.840 --> 16:00.150
<i>I know how much you want to protect Sayaka.</i>

339
16:00.760 --> 16:02.840
<i>I think it's good you're coming along with us.</i>

340
16:03.330 --> 16:07.200
<i>That way, if we find ourselves in a bad
spot, you'll be a trump card.</i>

341
16:10.900 --> 16:12.700
<i>But I...uh...</i>

342
16:12.700 --> 16:14.350
<i>You don't have to decide now.</i>

343
16:14.840 --> 16:17.130
<i>And I'm sure Sayaka will be against it.</i>

344
16:17.840 --> 16:20.420
<i>But if you ever do decide on something to wish for,</i>

345
16:20.900 --> 16:25.150
<i>remember, I will always be ready to grant it for you.</i>

346
16:27.120 --> 16:28.150
<i>Okay...</i>

347
21:45.610 --> 21:46.520
<i>That's right.</i>

348
21:46.910 --> 21:48.880
<i>If I make a contract with him, then...</i>
