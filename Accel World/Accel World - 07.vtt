HE QUIT THE KENDO CLUB?
HE DID.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.245
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT REALLY CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:20.678
I JUST COULDN’T BELIEVE IT.

00:00:20.678 --> 00:00:22.378
WELL, DID YOU ASK HIM WHY?

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:25.245
I TRIED.
BUT HE WOULDN’T TELL ME.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:30.045
HE JUST SAID THAT HE HAD
SOMETHING ELSE HE HAD TO DO.

DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME?

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:41.745
I SAID, "LET’S
GET THIS STARTED."

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.345
WAIT!
I JUST WANNA--

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:44.745
MAKE NO MISTAKE.

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.811
YOU’VE JUST BEEN STOPPED
BY A FELLOW BURST LINKER

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:48.011
AND CHALLENGED TO A DUEL.

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:49.645
YOU MUST ACCEPT
THIS CHALLENGE

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.678
AND FIGHT ME WITH
EVERYTHING YOU’VE GOT.

00:00:51.678 --> 00:00:53.745
THOSE ARE THE RULES
THAT GOVERN THIS WORLD.

<i>AND AS YOU KNOW I’M LEVEL ONE,</i>

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:08.800
<i>SO WE SHOULD SELECT OPPONENTS</i>
<i>WHO TOTAL LEVEL SIX OR GREATER.</i>

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.100
<i>IF THE SUM OF THE LEVEL</i>
<i>DIFFERENCE IS THREE OR MORE,</i>

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.200
<i>YOU WON’T BE STRIPPED</i>

<i>EVEN IF YOU LOSE.</i>

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.933
<i>YEAH, I SEE THE LOGIC</i>
<i>IN THAT BUT...</i>

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:19.200
<i>WAIT! SO, IS THAT</i>
<i>WHY YOU DO THIS?</i>

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.533
<i>STAY AT LEVEL ONE</i>
<i>AND NEVER LEVEL UP</i>
<i>ANY HIGHER?</i>

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:22.833
<i>THAT’S ONE OF THE REASONS.</i>

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:24.033
<i>BUT THERE ARE OTHERS.</i>

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:25.433
<i>WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,</i>

<i>THESE TWO ARE</i>
<i>AT LEVEL THREE AND FOUR.</i>

<i>BUT BECAUSE THEY</i>
<i>EACH HAVE LOTS OF POINTS,</i>

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:41.366
<i>THEY SHOULD BE UP</i>
<i>FOR A HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE.</i>

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:44.000
<i>OKAY.</i>
<i>IF YOU CAN KEEP YOUR COOL</i>

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.066
<i>AND FIGHT TO THE BEST</i>
<i>OF YOUR ABILITY,</i>

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:48.200

<i>BE ABLE TO WIN.</i>

<i>BUT REMEMBER</i>
<i>THE MOST IMPORTANT</i>
<i>THING’S NOT WINNING--</i>

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:09.766
<i>IT’S ENJOYING IT!</i>

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:13.300
<i>IT’S JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING</i>
<i>THAT MY GUARDIAN TAUGHT ME.</i>

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.266
<i>THAT IT’S SUPER IMPORTANT</i>
<i>TO ALWAYS ENJOY</i>
<i>EVERY DUEL I HAVE.</i>

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:18.100
<i>CORRECT.</i>

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.033

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.466
OKAY.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.866

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.433

THERE’S NO NEED TO HOLD BACK.

00:07:33.266 --> 00:07:36.466
I’VE RECOVERED ENOUGH POINTS NOW
THAT EVEN IF I LOSE TO YOU,

00:07:36.466 --> 00:07:38.166
I’LL BE FINE.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.700
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO EARN A LOT OF POINTS.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.900
PERHAPS THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS
IS THE BEST YOU’VE GOT.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.366
I ASKED A MESSENGER
FROM LEONIDS ABOUT YOU.

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:52.766
I HEARD YOU PULLED OUT
OF THE KENDO TOURNAMENT.

00:07:52.766 --> 00:07:54.300

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.500

FOR WHAT?

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:01.033
BECAUSE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:03.300
I DON’T DESERVE
TO REMAIN HERE.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.500
NOT LIKE THIS.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.233
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:10.233
YOU WANT TO TAKE ALL
THAT YOU HAVE EARNED

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:12.400
AND ACQUIRED
AND THROW IT AWAY.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.200
TO PAY FOR YOUR MISTAKE
BY GIVING UP EVERYTHING.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.000
ONCE YOU’VE HELPED HARUYUKI
BECOME A BURST LINKER

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
WHO CAN HOLD HIS
OWN IN ANY FIGHT

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.800

YOU PLAN TO UNINSTALL
IT YOURSELF.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.900

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.933
IT’S THE ONLY
THING I CAN DO.

00:08:29.933 --> 00:08:31.733
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
AFTER THAT?

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:34.900
WHAT ABOUT HARUYUKI?
AND KURASHIMA?

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.266
WHO RIGHT NOW IS DESPERATELY
TRYING TO FORGIVE YOU.

00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.300
YOU’RE TAKING
THEIR FEELINGS

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.266
AND STOMPING
ALL OVER THEM.

00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:47.900
THEN TELL ME WHAT
OTHER CHOICE DO I HAVE?

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:51.800
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?!

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.900

A REAL FIGHT.

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:05.766
I’LL HANDLE SAND DUCT.

00:09:05.766 --> 00:09:07.766
YOU TAKE NICKEL DOLL.

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:10.300
SHE CAN EMIT ELECTRIC CURRENTS
FROM HER HANDS.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.766
SO WHATEVER YOU DO,

00:09:11.766 --> 00:09:13.166
DON’T LET HER CATCH YOU.

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:15.500

AWAY MY TRICKS!

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.366

HOW’D THAT FEEL, HUH?

00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.966
THAT WASN’T NICE.

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:39.766
THROWING ME HEAD FIRST
INTO THIS MUCK.

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:41.166
YA’ GREAT BIG BULLY!

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:42.166
BULLY?!

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.833
SHOULDN’T YOU BE WORRIED?

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.166
I MEAN AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE STANDING
IN A TOXIC SWAMP.

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.733
IT’S GONNA CAUSE
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.033
I’M AT LEVEL FOUR,

00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:51.900
MY HP WILL LAST WAY
LONGER THAN YOURS.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.466
POISON DOESN’T
AFFECT SILVER!

00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:55.166
CRAP, THAT’S RIGHT!

00:09:55.166 --> 00:09:57.933
YOUR COLOR STANDS
ON THE FAR LEFT
OF THE METAL CHART.

00:09:57.933 --> 00:10:00.366
YES, OF COURSE,
YOU’RE SILVER.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:01.666
( laughing )

00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:03.166
SO?

00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:05.433
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD
STUDY UP A BIT MORE

00:10:05.433 --> 00:10:07.133
ON THAT COLOR OF YOURS.

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:11.300
SILVER IS RESISTANT
TO POISON BUT...

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.633
IT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER METAL!

00:10:15.633 --> 00:10:17.300
AHH!

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:20.700
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.500
SILVER IS FOUR TIMES MORE
CONDUCTIVE THAN NICKEL,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.033
SO THIS WILL BE OVER
IN NO TIME.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.800
( groaning )

00:10:31.366 --> 00:10:33.033
( grunting )

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:36.233
( gasps )
SO THAT’S THE AVIATION ABILITY!

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:38.000
DIVE ATTACK!

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:43.633
DID YOU WIN?

00:10:43.633 --> 00:10:46.600
NO, NOT YET.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.666
THAT WAS A NICE MOVE.

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.300
POWERFUL AND ELEGANT.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.800
BUT THE OUTCOME
HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.433
AND YOU WILL NOT BE THE WINNERS.

00:11:03.071 --> 00:11:05.352
SPLASH STINGER!

00:11:05.352 --> 00:11:06.885
TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO!

00:11:06.885 --> 00:11:08.285
HOW ELSE CAN I
RIGHT MY WRONGS?

00:11:08.285 --> 00:11:10.252
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:12.052
( groans )

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:14.452
LET’S BE HONEST HERE,
SHALL WE?

00:11:14.452 --> 00:11:18.085
YOU DON’T REALLY WANT TO ATONE
BY UNINSTALLING BRAIN BURST.

00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:20.785
BUT AS LONG AS YOU HAVE
THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM

00:11:20.785 --> 00:11:22.585
YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT YOU DID

00:11:22.585 --> 00:11:24.785
AND YOU HATE
YOURSELF FOR THAT.

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:26.052
NO, IT’S NOT THAT.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.418
HARUYUKI HOLDS NO
GRUDGE AGAINST YOU

00:11:28.418 --> 00:11:31.585
AND THE MORE KURASHIMA
TRIES TO ACT LIKE
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED

00:11:31.585 --> 00:11:33.318
THE MORE GUILT IT CAUSES.

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.785
YOU HATE THE FACT THAT
YOU HAD TO BE FORGIVEN.

00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:37.218
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:39.352
WHAT YOU HATE MOST,
IS BEING IMPERFECT.

00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:40.785
THAT’S NOT IT.

00:11:40.785 --> 00:11:43.552
THE PROBLEM IS YOU’RE
TOO SELF INVOLVED.

00:11:43.552 --> 00:11:44.952
YOU’RE TRYING
TO PUNISH YOURSELF

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:47.052
INSTEAD OF JUST
OWNING YOUR MISTAKE.

00:11:47.052 --> 00:11:48.252
YOU’RE WRONG!

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:51.085
AM I?

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.652
YOU’RE WRONG.

00:11:52.652 --> 00:11:55.085
YOU DON’T KNOW ME AT ALL.
TAKE IT BACK!

00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:57.085
SAND BLAST!

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.418
YOU TWO ARE FORGETTING
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

00:12:01.418 --> 00:12:02.885
OF A TAG TEAM MATCH.

00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.452
THAT YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
MUST WORK TOGETHER.

00:12:05.452 --> 00:12:08.518
YOU’RE NOT ATTACKING AS A TEAM.

00:12:08.518 --> 00:12:11.152
IT DOESN’T MATTER HOW STRONG
YOU ARE AS INDIVIDUALS.

00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:13.785
THAT’S NOT WHAT MATTERS
IN A TAG TEAM FIGHT.

00:12:13.785 --> 00:12:16.152
YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.185
AND THAT’S WHY...

00:12:17.185 --> 00:12:21.385
THIS BATTLE HASN’T
BEEN DECIDED YET.

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:22.618
( gasps )

00:12:22.618 --> 00:12:24.218
UP UNTIL NOW,

00:12:24.218 --> 00:12:26.552
ALL THE TAG TEAM MATCHES
I’VE BEEN FIGHTING

00:12:26.552 --> 00:12:29.185
HAVE BEEN WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:31.085
SO, I GET IT.

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:34.218
I KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO DO IN A DUEL LIKE THIS

00:12:34.218 --> 00:12:36.085
IS TO BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER.

00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:38.918
AND THE PERSON I BELIEVE
IN IS MISS CURRENT.

00:12:40.785 --> 00:12:43.652
LISTEN TO HIM,
TRYING TO SOUND ALL COOL!

00:12:43.652 --> 00:12:45.018
ALL RIGHT, SANDY,

00:12:45.018 --> 00:12:47.418
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE BLOW THESE LOSERS AWAY

00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:50.018
WITH OUR ULTRA GORGEOUS
SPECIAL MOVE?

00:12:50.018 --> 00:12:51.152
LET’S DO IT!

00:12:54.352 --> 00:12:55.885
HERE COMES
THEIR JOINT ATTACK.

00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:58.752
BE READY.
OK. HUH?

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:00.285
WHERE’RE YOU GOING?!

00:13:00.285 --> 00:13:02.785
WELL WE CAN’T LET THEM TAKE US
BOTH OUT, CAN WE?

00:13:02.785 --> 00:13:04.685
I’LL WATCH
AND IF YOU NEED ME

00:13:04.685 --> 00:13:06.085
I’LL HELP OUT.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:08.185
COME ON! DIDN’T YOU HEAR
A WORD I JUST SAID?!

00:13:08.185 --> 00:13:10.885
ABOUT TAG TEAMS
WORKING TOGETHER?!

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:16.185
TURBO...

00:13:16.185 --> 00:13:17.985
MOLECULAR!

00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:25.252
HE’S ABSORBING THE WIND
HE GENERATED THROUGH HIS ARMS!

00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:26.652
BUT FOR WHAT?

00:13:32.652 --> 00:13:34.118
WHAT IS THIS?

00:13:34.118 --> 00:13:36.952
THE TURBINES IN HIS ARMS
ARE DISPERSING THE MOLECULES

00:13:36.952 --> 00:13:38.685
IN THE AIR
AND CREATING A VACUUM.

00:13:38.685 --> 00:13:40.785
THE WIND ITSELF
IS NOT HARMFUL,

00:13:40.785 --> 00:13:43.718
BUT IT’LL DRAG YOU IN
FOR CLOSE RANGE COMBAT.

00:13:43.718 --> 00:13:45.118
SO THAT’S THEIR PLAN.

00:13:45.118 --> 00:13:46.818
<i>WAIT A SEC.</i>

00:13:46.818 --> 00:13:49.385
<i>BUT IF I CAN GET IN CLOSE</i>
<i>AND LAND A GOOD KICK THEN...</i>

00:13:49.385 --> 00:13:51.385
<i>HERE GOES!</i>

00:13:51.385 --> 00:13:53.185
AHH!

00:13:54.285 --> 00:13:55.652
IDIOT!

00:13:55.652 --> 00:13:57.518
ANODE CATHODE!

00:13:57.518 --> 00:13:59.385
AHH!

00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:01.185
<i>HOW’S SHE DOING THIS?</i>

00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:03.452
<i>SHE’S NOT TOUCHING ME</i>
<i>AND THERE’S NO WATER AROUND.</i>

00:14:03.452 --> 00:14:06.918
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME AND
SANDY’S ULTRA GORGEOUS ATTACK?

00:14:06.918 --> 00:14:09.518
MAYBE IT’S NOT AS GOOD
AS THAT PURPLE LADY’S ATTACK,

00:14:09.518 --> 00:14:12.318
BUT IT’S PRETTY DANG CLOSE.

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:14.052
( continues yelling )

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:15.352
A GLOW DISCHARGE...

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:18.418
WHEN VOLTAGE MEETS ELECTRODES,
PLASMA IS FORMED.

00:14:18.418 --> 00:14:19.852
WITH ENOUGH LOW PRESSURE,

00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:22.485
ELECTRICITY IS CONDUCTED
AND FLOWS THROUGH THE AIR.

00:14:22.485 --> 00:14:27.052
BETTER JUMP IN SOON OR YOU WON’T
HAVE ANY CLIENT LEFT TO SAVE!

00:14:27.052 --> 00:14:30.518
BUT WITH THAT BODY, I DON’T KNOW
WHAT HELP YOU’RE GONNA BE.

00:14:34.052 --> 00:14:37.518
I’M SURE HARUYUKI
HAS MENTIONED WHAT
HE WANTS FROM YOU.

00:14:37.518 --> 00:14:39.452
WHY WON’T YOU LISTEN?

00:14:39.452 --> 00:14:40.718
BECAUSE...

00:14:40.718 --> 00:14:42.518
SHOULDN’T LISTENING
TO HIS WISH,

00:14:42.518 --> 00:14:45.052
BE THE FIRST THING YOU DO?

00:14:45.052 --> 00:14:46.352
( screams )

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.885
Hime:
HARUYUKI TOLD ME

00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:50.452
THAT YOU ARE HIS BEST FRIEND!

00:14:50.452 --> 00:14:51.652
( grunts )

00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:53.218
JUST GIVE UP.

00:14:53.218 --> 00:14:56.452
YOU’RE HP IS WAY TOO LOW
TO MAKE A COMEBACK NOW.

00:14:56.452 --> 00:14:57.918
NEVER!
( grunts )

00:14:57.918 --> 00:15:01.518
I CAN’T.
I WON’T LOSE THIS.

00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:04.485
TAKU, MY BEST FRIEND,

00:15:04.485 --> 00:15:07.385
WE’RE WIPING THE SLATE CLEAN!

00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:08.985
SO I HAVE TO...

00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:10.618
KEEP FIGHTING!

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.252
IT’S OVER.

00:15:12.252 --> 00:15:13.618
Sand Duct: NICKY.
HUH?

00:15:17.152 --> 00:15:18.385
( gasps )

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:19.585
THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.985
WATER SHOULD CONDUCT
ELECTRICITY.

00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:25.285
MY BODY IS COMPOSED OF WATER
WITH NO IMPURITIES.

00:15:25.285 --> 00:15:27.118
AND AS WATER THEORY STATES,

00:15:27.118 --> 00:15:30.852
TRULY PURE WATER
IS A PERFECT INSULATOR.

00:15:30.852 --> 00:15:33.085
DAMN IT!
YOU DOUCHEBAGS!

00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:36.385
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF A TAG TEAM MATCH...

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.118
IS ALWAYS TEAMWORK.

00:15:39.118 --> 00:15:42.352
WHY DO YOU THINK LEGIONS EXIST
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD?

00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:45.152
BECAUSE COMPETING WITH YOUR
FRIENDS AND SUPPORTING THEM

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:47.918
OPENS UP ALL SORTS
OF POSSIBILITIES.

00:15:47.918 --> 00:15:50.085
YOU’VE ALWAYS
FOUGHT BY YOURSELF.

00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.385
YOU’VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THE TRUE JOY

00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:54.285
FIGHTING WITH A TEAM PROVIDES.

00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:55.752
TRY IT AND YOU WILL SEE,

00:15:55.752 --> 00:15:57.518
THE POSSIBILITIES
ARE LIMITLESS.

00:15:57.518 --> 00:16:00.018
( yelling )

00:16:02.718 --> 00:16:06.052
Hime: THAT IS HOW YOU SHOULD
ATONE FOR YOUR MISTAKES.

00:16:11.585 --> 00:16:13.785
<i>YOUR POINTS ARE</i>
<i>BACK UP TO 54.</i>

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.785
<i>MY WORK HERE IS DONE.</i>

00:16:15.785 --> 00:16:17.785
<i>THANK YOU SO MUCH</i>
<i>FOR ALL THE HELP.</i>

00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:19.918
<i>THE PLEASURE WAS ALL MINE.</i>

00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:22.252
<i>THANKS TO YOU,</i>
<i>I WAS ABLE TO LEARN</i>

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:24.952
<i>SEVERAL NEW BURST LINKER’S</i>
<i>TRICKS I DIDN’T KNOW BEFORE.</i>

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:30.185
<i>SO, DO YOU ALWAYS</i>
<i>HANG OUT AROUND HERE?</i>

00:16:30.185 --> 00:16:32.218
<i>HMM? WHY?</i>

00:16:32.218 --> 00:16:34.085
<i>WELL, IT’S JUST...</i>

00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:38.918
<i>I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE</i>
<i>COULD MEET AGAIN SOMETIME.</i>

00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:40.018
( laughs )

00:16:40.018 --> 00:16:41.418
<i>WE WON’T BE</i>
<i>MEETING AGAIN.</i>

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:42.785
<i>HUH?</i>

00:16:42.785 --> 00:16:44.918
<i>I CHOSE THIS PLACE</i>
<i>BECAUSE VERY FEW</i>

00:16:44.918 --> 00:16:46.852
<i>BURST LINKER’S COME HERE.</i>

00:16:46.852 --> 00:16:49.952
<i>WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR ME</i>
<i>TO COLLECT MY BONUS PAYMENT.</i>

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:52.352
<i>BONUS PAYMENT?!</i>
<i>I WASN’T TOLD OF SUCH--</i>

00:16:52.352 --> 00:16:54.018
( no audible dialogue )

00:17:05.818 --> 00:17:08.818
AND NOW, I’M GOING TO STRIP
YOU OF ALL YOUR POINTS.

00:17:08.818 --> 00:17:10.885
I CAN INITIATE
CONSECUTIVE DUELS

00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:13.185
AS LONG AS YOU HAVEN’T
UNPLUGGED THE CABLE.

00:17:13.185 --> 00:17:16.218
I INTEND TO KEEP
FIGHTING YOU UNTIL ALL
YOUR POINTS ARE GONE.

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:17.485
UH...

00:17:17.485 --> 00:17:20.052
SO, IS THIS
YOUR BONUS PAYMENT?

00:17:20.052 --> 00:17:21.718
OF COURSE.

00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:24.485
THERE’S NO POINT IN BEING
A BOUNCER OTHERWISE.

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:26.385
NOW, GET READY.

00:17:26.385 --> 00:17:29.252
I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME
EVERYTHING YOU’VE GOT.

00:17:29.252 --> 00:17:32.218
EVERY LAST DROP.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:34.118
( gasps )

00:17:34.118 --> 00:17:35.785
WHAT?

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:37.785
AREN’T YOU AT LEAST
GOING TO TRY?

00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:41.585
I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I TRUST YOU.

00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:43.685
FROM THE VERY
FIRST MOMENT WE MET,

00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:45.952
I BELIEVED YOU WERE
A GOOD PERSON.

00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:51.352
SEE, I HAD A REALLY
INTENSE DUEL

00:17:51.352 --> 00:17:53.185
WITH A GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE RECENTLY.

00:17:53.185 --> 00:17:56.352
I LET MY ANGER
AND PAIN TAKEOVER
AS WE FOUGHT.

00:17:56.352 --> 00:18:00.452
I REALLY HATED HIM
IN THAT BATTLE.

00:18:02.818 --> 00:18:03.985
BUT...

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:08.118
IN THE END I WAS ABLE
TO TRUST HIM AGAIN.

00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:09.752
AND I MADE UP MY MIND.

00:18:09.752 --> 00:18:12.252
I DECIDED THAT ONCE
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
IN SOMEONE,

00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:15.152
I WILL NEVER LET THAT GO.

00:18:17.252 --> 00:18:19.485
I WILL ALWAYS
BELIEVE IN THEM.

00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:24.585
SO, YOU WON’T FIGHT ME?

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:27.885
I WON’T GO UP AGAINST
SOMEONE THAT I BELIEVE IN.

00:18:31.252 --> 00:18:32.885
I WAS JUST LYING.

00:18:32.885 --> 00:18:35.552
I WANTED TO SCARE YOU A BIT
SINCE YOU’RE SO UNGUARDED.

00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:38.885
BUT THAT DIDN’T
SEEM TO WORK.

00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:41.652
NO, IT DID.

00:18:41.652 --> 00:18:45.685
( crying ) YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME!

00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:47.518
( chuckles )
HUH?

00:18:47.518 --> 00:18:51.252
A LONG TIME AGO,
I HAD FRIENDS TOO.

00:18:51.252 --> 00:18:52.685
AND A MASTER I CARED ABOUT.

00:18:52.685 --> 00:18:54.752
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED

00:18:54.752 --> 00:18:57.118
AND WE ALL WENT
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

00:18:57.118 --> 00:19:00.052
WOW. REALLY?

00:19:00.052 --> 00:19:02.452
TREASURE YOU FRIENDS.
DON’T EVER FORGET THAT.

00:19:02.452 --> 00:19:03.685
HUH?

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:05.652
WE WEREN’T
SUPPOSED TO MEET.

00:19:05.652 --> 00:19:09.285
AT LEAST NOT YET.
YOU’VE JUST BEGUN.

00:19:09.285 --> 00:19:12.252
YOU AND YOUR MASTER
HAVE A LONG JOURNEY
AHEAD OF YOU.

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.652
WE ELEMENTS SHOULDN’T
INTERVENE IN THAT.

00:19:14.652 --> 00:19:17.218
THAT’S WHY I HAVE
TO DO THIS.

00:19:17.218 --> 00:19:19.418
ERASE YOUR MEMORY OF ME.

00:19:19.418 --> 00:19:21.418
DO WHAT?

00:19:21.418 --> 00:19:23.785
MEMORY LEAK.

00:19:42.518 --> 00:19:46.118
( groaning )

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:47.685
WAIT A SEC.

00:19:47.685 --> 00:19:50.518
WHAT THE...
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:58.785
WHOSE CABLE IS THIS?

00:20:09.485 --> 00:20:10.885
Taku’s Mom:
CHIYURI CAME BY

00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:13.385
AND DROPPED OFF
SOME OF YOUR STUFF.

00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:14.852
( grunts )

00:20:14.852 --> 00:20:16.452
CHI...

00:20:16.452 --> 00:20:20.418
Mom: SHE PUT THEM ON YOUR BED
AND THEN WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

00:20:20.418 --> 00:20:23.218
HEY, MOM?

00:20:23.218 --> 00:20:27.485
THERE’S SOMETHING
THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU.

00:20:38.518 --> 00:20:41.485
MORNING!
OH.

00:20:41.485 --> 00:20:43.652
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

00:20:43.652 --> 00:20:45.118
WHY ARE YOU STILL
ACTING ALL WEIRD?

00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:47.852
HUH?
LOOK, WHAT’S DONE
IS DONE, OKAY?

00:20:47.852 --> 00:20:51.052
OR MAYBE YOU’RE LOOKING
FOR A CHANCE TO BUY
ME MORE ICE CREAM?

00:20:51.052 --> 00:20:52.285
CHIYU...

00:20:52.285 --> 00:20:54.085
Taku:
YOU HEARD HER, HARU.

00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:55.285
( both gasp )

00:20:55.285 --> 00:20:58.185
MORNING GUYS.

00:21:00.285 --> 00:21:02.552
THAT UNIFORM
HE’S WEARING.

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:04.752
IT’S ONE
OF OUR UNIFORMS.

00:21:07.852 --> 00:21:10.333
Chiyu and Haru:
WHAT?!

00:21:14.074 --> 00:21:16.440
Taku:
THANK YOU.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.107
Hime: GLASSES?
IN THIS DAY AND AGE?

00:21:22.107 --> 00:21:23.740
NEURO-LINKER’S VISION CORRECTION

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.907
HAS PRETTY MUCH MADE GLASSES
A THING OF THE PAST.

00:21:26.907 --> 00:21:28.407
I’VE DECIDED...

00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:30.274
I WANT TO SEE THINGS WITH
MY OWN EYES FROM NOW ON.

00:21:30.274 --> 00:21:33.507
I WANT TO SEE
THE REAL CHI...
AND HARU.

00:21:33.507 --> 00:21:35.907
AS WELL AS MYSELF.

00:21:35.907 --> 00:21:41.674
( chuckles )
THEY SUIT YOU.

00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:44.040
WAIT!
HMM?

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.607
TELL ME...

00:21:45.607 --> 00:21:47.640
I’M CURIOUS AS TO HOW
YOU HAPPENED TO KNOW

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.840
SO MUCH ABOUT ME?

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.207
I DON’T REALLY.
HUH?

00:21:51.207 --> 00:21:54.207
BUT AS I THINK
YOU MAY KNOW,

00:21:54.207 --> 00:21:58.140
I ALSO COMMITTED AN ACT ONCE
THAT I CAN NEVER TAKE BACK.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.107
THAT’S ALL.

00:22:01.107 --> 00:22:06.240
THANK YOU, MY MASTER.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.107
Haru:
HEY! TAKU!

00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:10.607
( both giggling )
