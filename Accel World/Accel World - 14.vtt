00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:11.179
( sighs )

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.612
HEY, TAKU.

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:16.479
HUH?
THAT NOMI KID...

00:00:16.479 --> 00:00:18.846
DO YOU THINK HE’S
A BURST LINKER?

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:21.012
SO <i>THAT’S</i> WHAT’S
BEEN BUGGING YOU TODAY.

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:23.546
LOOK, THE VERY SECOND
I THOUGHT HE ACCELERATED,

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.979
I ACCELERATED AS WELL.
BUT IT’S WEIRD....

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:28.679
WHEN I CHECKED
THE MATCHING LIST,
HIS NAME WASN’T ON IT.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:33.646
Chiyuri: OH, GREAT.
( grunts )

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.546
YOU’RE EATING THAT
JUNK FOOD AGAIN?

00:00:35.546 --> 00:00:37.512
I’VE BEEN TELLING YOU THIS
FOR AGES, HARU.

00:00:37.512 --> 00:00:39.479
YOU REALLY NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO COOK FOR YOURSELF.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.512
YEAH, BUT I SORT OF
<i>DID</i> COOK THIS.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:43.012
I MEAN, IT’S NOT TAKE-OUT.

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:45.479
ALL YOU DID WAS TAKE IT
OUT OF THE BOX AND REHEAT IT.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.479
YEAH, BUT I SERVED IT
ON A PLATE.

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.079
THAT <i>STILL</i> DOESN’T
COUNT AS COOKING.
( sighs )

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.212
I FIGURED THIS WOULD HAPPEN...

00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:54.812
SO I GOT MY MOM
TO MAKE HER FAMOUS LASAGNA.

00:00:54.812 --> 00:00:56.146
AM I THE BEST, OR WHAT?

00:00:56.146 --> 00:00:57.646
( both gasping )

00:00:57.646 --> 00:01:00.612
WAIT, YOU DIDN’T COOK THAT
YOURSELF, EITHER.

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:02.312
YEAH, AND?
NOTHING!

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:04.646
THANKS A LOT!
THAT WAS VERY NICE.

00:01:05.746 --> 00:01:07.446
Taku: THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.246
YOUR MOM IS SUCH
A GREAT COOK.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:10.812
SHE SHOULD OPEN UP
A RESTAURANT.

00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:11.779
YOU WOULD THINK,

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.479
BUT ACTUALLY,
IT WOULD NEVER WORK.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.879
WHEN SHE ISN’T
COOKING SOMETHING FOR MY DAD,

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.712
SHE ONLY EVER
PUTS IN HALF THE EFFORT.

00:01:16.712 --> 00:01:18.379
THIS IS HALF
AND IT’S THIS GOOD?

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:19.646
NO, THIS IS MORE THAN THAT.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.612
I’D SAY IT’S HER
AT ABOUT 95%.

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:24.012
SEE, MY MOM THOUGHT SHE
WAS COOKING THIS MEAL

00:01:24.012 --> 00:01:26.112
FOR THE GUY WHO’S GONNA
BECOME MY FUTURE HUSBAND.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:29.812
SHE’S SO SILLY.
I MEAN, WE’RE STILL
JUST KIDS, RIGHT?

YOU THINK NOMI
IS A BURST LINKER?!

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.237
WELL, HE DIDN’T
APPEAR ON THE MATCHING LIST,

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:12.270
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE
DURING OUR MATCH...

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.137
THAT HE WAS ACCELERATING.

00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:16.403
NOW THAT YOU SAY THAT,
YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:18.137
WHENEVER HE
DODGED YOUR ATTACKS,

00:03:18.137 --> 00:03:20.103
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ABLE
TO SEE THEM COMING.

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:21.537
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:23.137
IT WAS LIKE HE WAS ABLE
TO MOVE HIS REAL BODY

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:25.703
WHILE HE WAS
IN AN ACCELERATED STATE.
( grunts )

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:27.403
( no audible dialogue )

00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:33.970
WAIT. IT WAS JUST LIKE
PHYSICAL FULL BURST.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.470
WHAT’S THAT MEAN?

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.603
IT’S A FORBIDDEN COMMAND
THAT ONLY LEVEL NINE LINKERS
CAN USE.

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:43.237
IF YOU USE IT, YOU LOSE 99%
OF YOUR TOTAL POINTS.

00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:46.503
BUT YOUR REAL BODY CAN THEN
MOVE A HUNDRED TIMES FASTER.

00:03:46.503 --> 00:03:48.837
SERIOUSLY?
YEAH, BUT KEEP IN MIND

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:51.370
THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN PEOPLE
WHO’VE EVER REACHED LEVEL NINE.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.503
AND NONE OF THEM HAD ANY REASON
TO BE AT THAT PRACTICE MATCH.

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:57.670
BESIDES, EVEN IF NOMI DOES
TURN OUT TO BE A LEVEL NINE,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.137
WHY WOULD HE RISK
USING 99% OF HIS TOTAL POINTS

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:01.803
FOR WHAT WAS BASICALLY
A PRACTICE MATCH?

00:04:01.803 --> 00:04:03.337
IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:04:03.337 --> 00:04:06.470
UNLESS HE WASN’T
USING PHYSICAL FULL BURST
AT ALL,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.337
BUT SOMETHING FAR LESS RISKY.

00:04:08.337 --> 00:04:10.270
HUH? W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.737
( grunts softly )
( sighs )

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:17.803
PHYSICAL BURST.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:21.403
( gasps )

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:26.437
NO WAY.

00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:27.970
YOUR BODY DOESN’T ACCELERATE,

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.003
BUT YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
DOES BECOME TEN TIMES FASTER.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:32.470
IT LASTS FOR THREE SECONDS.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.203
SO IF YOU USE THAT, THEN...

00:04:34.203 --> 00:04:37.103
THEN DODGING YOUR OPPONENT’S
ATTACKS IN A FIGHT

00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.970
OR EVEN HITTING A HOME RUN
IN BASEBALL BECOMES PRETTY EASY.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.503
AND OF COURSE, IT GIVES YOU
AMAZING RESULTS IN A KENDO
TOURNAMENT.

00:04:43.503 --> 00:04:46.003
EVERYTHING BECOMES EASY
FOR YOU.

00:04:46.003 --> 00:04:48.503
JUST LIKE IT WAS FOR ME.

00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:50.837
UH--UM, TAKU?

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:51.903
( sighs )

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:55.070
SEIJI NOMI IS EXACTLY
LIKE I WAS A YEAR AGO.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.537
WHAT RIGHT DO I HAVE TO SIT HERE
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING BEAT

00:04:57.537 --> 00:04:59.003
BY HIM WHEN--OW!

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:04.037
( groaning softly )

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.003
YOU’RE WRONG!
YOU ARE NOT THE SAME!

00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:10.803
CHI, BUT--BUT I...

00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:12.603
WHEN YOU WERE
WINNING ALL THOSE MATCHES,

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.237
YOU WERE DOING IT
FOR US, RIGHT?

00:05:14.237 --> 00:05:15.837
WHENEVER YOU’D WIN,
THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD DO

00:05:15.837 --> 00:05:18.503
IS FIND ME IN THE CROWD
AND THEN SMILE AND WAVE.

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:20.037
( grunts )
MM-HMM.

00:05:20.037 --> 00:05:21.570
BUT THIS GUY IS DIFFERENT.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.603
IF YOU ASK ME,
THE ONLY PERSON THIS NOMI KID

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:24.937
IS FIGHTING FOR IS HIMSELF.

00:05:24.937 --> 00:05:27.170
AFTER HE WON,
HE JUST SORT OF SAT THERE

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.937
<i>AND LOOKED ALL SMUG.</i>

00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:31.537
THAT’S WHY I’M SAYING
HE’S NOT LIKE YOU AT ALL.

00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:32.570
( sighs )

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.037
YEAH. SHE’S RIGHT, TAKU.

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:35.970
AND YOU’RE A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.037
LISTEN, WHAT WE HAVE
TO DO NEXT IS FIGURE OUT

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.137
HOW HE’S BEEN KEEPING HIS NAME
OFF THE MATCHING LIST.

00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:43.003
AND <i>THEN</i> WE CAN GO
AND THRASH HIM IN A DUEL.

00:05:43.003 --> 00:05:46.637
EXACTLY. AND NO MATTER
HOW BADLY YOU GET BEATEN UP,

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:48.237
I’LL KEEP ON HEALING YOU.

00:05:48.237 --> 00:05:50.470
THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:55.137
ALL RIGHT, I’LL SEE WHAT I CAN
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS NOMI GUY

00:05:55.137 --> 00:05:56.470
DURING OUR NEXT CLUB PRACTICE.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.070
( metal rings )

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:17.337
NICE JOB, SILVER CROW,

00:06:17.337 --> 00:06:19.537
CYAN PILE.
SAME TO YOU.

00:06:19.537 --> 00:06:21.670
I HAVE TO RUN.
I’M ON A SHORT BREAK

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.237
DURING THE MIDDLE
OF KENDO PRACTICE.
SORRY.

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:27.537
MASTER, IF I DON’T
SEE YOU BEFORE YOU
LEAVE FOR OKINAWA TOMORROW,

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:28.670
HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

00:06:30.503 --> 00:06:33.070
HE’S REALLY INTO HIS
KENDO CLUB, ISN’T HE?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.003
( breathes heavily )
YEAH, I GUESS HE HIS.

00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:36.637
ACTUALLY, ABOUT THAT...

00:06:36.637 --> 00:06:39.670
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING
REGARDING THE KENDO CLUB.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.237
HUH?

00:06:41.237 --> 00:06:43.070
( sparring in distance )

00:06:45.403 --> 00:06:46.770
( grunts )

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.337
I’M SORRY.
IS SOMETHING WRONG, SENPAI?

00:06:49.337 --> 00:06:51.970
NOT AT ALL.
I’M JUST TRYING
TO LEARN THE SECRETS

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.837
BEHIND YOUR INCREDIBLE
SPEED AND STRENGTH.

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:55.703
I JUST GOT A LITTLE
LUCKY LAST TIME.

00:06:55.703 --> 00:06:57.370
THAT WAS IT.
NOT TRUE.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.837
THE WAY YOU MOVED
WAS REALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE.

00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:00.870
THANK YOU.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.770
BUT YOU’RE RATHER
IMPRESSIVE YOURSELF.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.303
I’D HEARD A LOT OF RUMORS
ABOUT YOU BEFORE OUR MATCH--

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:06.637
ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:08.303
BUT THAT WAS AT YOUR
PREVIOUS SCHOOL,

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:10.937
BEFORE YOU DECIDED
TO TRANSFER HERE.
( gasps )

00:07:10.937 --> 00:07:13.437
YOU KNOW, IF YOU STILL
FOUGHT AS HARD AS YOU USED TO,

00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:15.137
LIKE YOU DID BACK AT YOUR
OLD SCHOOL,

00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:18.537
THEN I BET I WOULD
BE NO MATCH FOR YOU.

00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:22.103
Kuroyukihime: <i>ARE YOU</i>
<i>POSITIVE ABOUT THIS?</i>

00:07:22.103 --> 00:07:24.670
THIS SEIJI NOMI,
A FIRST-YEAR STUDENT,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.003
ACCELERATED DURING A MATCH?

00:07:26.003 --> 00:07:28.237
WELL WE DON’T
HAVE ANY HARD PROOF YET.

00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:30.637
AND HIS NAME DIDN’T SHOW UP
ON THE MATCHING LIST, EITHER.

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:34.503
IT’S PROBABLY
BEING MASKED BY SOME SORT
OF ILLEGAL PROGRAM.

00:07:34.503 --> 00:07:37.003
BUT EVEN IF HE
DID DO THIS, WHY?

00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:38.003
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:39.470
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.503
I GUESS THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT...

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.470
IS FOR US TO CHALLENGE HIM
TO A DUEL

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.870
AND THEN ASK HIM OURSELVES.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.403
I SUPPOSE.

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:48.570
WHEN IT COMES
TO BEING A BURST LINKER,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.337
IT ALL STARTS WITH A DUEL.

00:07:50.337 --> 00:07:53.470
I’D PREFER IT
IF I WERE THE FIRST
TO FIGHT HIM.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.403
BUT I HAVE TO GO
ON THIS TRIP TOMORROW,

00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:57.170
AND WON’T BE BACK FOR A WEEK.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.203
PERHAPS I SHOULD
FAKE AN ILLNESS AND STAY.

00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:03.103
( gasps )
NO, NO, NO!
DON’T DO THAT!

00:08:03.103 --> 00:08:04.403
( gasps )

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:06.703
YOU HAVE TO GO.
IT’S A SCHOOL TRIP.

00:08:06.703 --> 00:08:08.437
WE’LL FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DEAL WITH NOMI.

00:08:08.437 --> 00:08:10.170
DON’T WORRY.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.470
FINE, THEN.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.337
BUT JUST DON’T
DO ANYTHING RASH.

00:08:13.337 --> 00:08:14.770
I WON’T. I PROMISE.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.703
WELL, I GUESS THIS
MEANS THAT YOU NOW

00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:20.303
KNOW EVERYTHING THERE
IS TO KNOW ABOUT THE PHYSICAL
BURST COMMAND.

00:08:20.303 --> 00:08:23.203
I WON’T SAY, "DON’T USE IT,"
BUT IN NEGA NEBULOUS,

00:08:23.203 --> 00:08:27.303
USING IT TO WIN SOME SORT
OF SPORTING EVENT
IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:29.003
NO WAY!
I’D NEVER DO THAT!

00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:32.403
LOOK, INSTEAD OF SPENDING FIVE
POINTS FOR JUST THREE SECONDS,

00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:34.037
I’D MUCH RATHER GIVE UP
TEN POINTS

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:36.503
TO DIVE INTO THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD.

00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:38.370
OH, BY THE WAY,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.270
DID YOU DECIDE WHAT IT IS
YOU WANT ME TO BRING YOU
FROM OKINAWA?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.437
YEAH, WELL,
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

00:08:43.437 --> 00:08:46.837
AND I DON’T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO LUG AROUND
ANYTHING BIG THE WHOLE TIME.

00:08:46.837 --> 00:08:49.203
SO I’D BE HAPPY IF YOU WOULD
JUST SHOW ME SOME OF THE MOVIES

00:08:49.203 --> 00:08:50.637
YOU RECORDED WHILE YOU
WERE THERE.

00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:53.037
REALLY?
THAT’S ALL YOU WANT?
ARE YOU SURE?

00:08:53.037 --> 00:08:55.603
( thinking )
<i>WELL, TO BE EXACT,</i>
<i>WHAT I REALLY WANT</i>
<i>ARE MOVIES OF YOU.</i>

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:59.570
<i>TO BE EVEN MORE EXACT,</i>
<i>SUPER-HIGH-RESOLUTION VIDEOS</i>
<i>OF YOU IN BIKINIS AND STUFF.</i>

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:03.270
<i>AND, IF YOU COULD SHOW THEM</i>
<i>TO ME THROUGH CABLE LINK WITH</i>
<i>A SHORT, 30-CENTIMETER CABLE--</i>

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.437
OKAY, I’LL RECORD LOTS
OF MOVIES AND SEND THEM TO YOU.
( whimpers )

00:09:06.437 --> 00:09:08.870
I’LL RECORD ALL THE OKINAWAN
FOOD I EAT.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.003
SOUND GOOD?

00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:11.903
UH--
( sighs )

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.103
Haru: THIS ISN’T REALLY
WHAT I HAD IN MIND, SENPAI.

00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:20.570
( grunts softly )

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.770
WHY COULDN’T I
BE IN THE SAME GRADE AS HER

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.270
SO I COULD
GO ON THIS TRIP, TOO?

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.770
( electronic tones )
( grunts )

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.903
Female Computerized Voice:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

00:09:26.903 --> 00:09:28.103
( grunts )
IS IT FROM SENPAI?

00:09:28.103 --> 00:09:29.670
( beeping )

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.837
Taku: <i>MORNING, HARU.</i>
AW, IT’S TAKU.

00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:35.770
<i>SORRY TO TAKE SO LONG</i>
<i>TO TELL YOU IF I</i>
<i>FOUND ANYTHING ON NOMI.</i>

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.803
<i>I TRIED TO CONNECT TO HIS NEURO</i>
<i>LINKER AND SEE IF BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>WAS INSTALLED ON IT,</i>

00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:41.970
<i>BUT I DIDN’T GET A CHANCE</i>
<i>TO DO IT.</i>

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.103
<i>BUT I DID FIND OUT</i>
<i>SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:47.437
<i>THERE WAS ANOTHER STUDENT</i>
<i>AT OUR SCHOOL NAME YUICHI NOMI.</i>

00:09:47.437 --> 00:09:49.403
<i>I FOUND HIM</i>
<i>IN THE GRADUATION PHOTO.</i>

00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:51.170
<i>HE’S THREE YEARS</i>
<i>OLDER THAN US.</i>

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.703
( grunts )
<i>IT’S PROBABLY HIS BROTHER.</i>

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:55.037
<i>IF NOMI IS A BURST LINKER,</i>

00:09:55.037 --> 00:09:58.670
<i>THEN HIS BROTHER</i>
<i>MIGHT BE HIS GUARDIAN.</i>

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.937
WHAT’S THE LAG?

00:10:00.937 --> 00:10:04.137
( electronic humming
and beeping )

00:10:04.137 --> 00:10:06.970
SO HE’S AN ALUM
FROM OUR SCHOOL, HUH?

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.803
WAIT A SEC.
THAT’S WEIRD.

00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:10.803
I’VE NEVER HEARD OF THERE
BEING ANOTHER BURST LINKER

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:13.670
AT OUR SCHOOL THAT’S OLDER
THAN KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.703
ARE YOU REALLY
A BURST LINKER?

00:10:22.003 --> 00:10:23.203
( sparring in distance )

00:10:23.203 --> 00:10:25.237
Takagi: HEY! NOMI!

00:10:25.237 --> 00:10:26.803
WE’RE NOT FINISHED YET.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.070
HEY!

00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:32.170
YOU PUNK.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.170
DON’T GET ALL COCKY
JUST ’CAUSE YOU MADE THE TEAM!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.337
JERK!

00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:39.637
( gasps )
( all gasping)

00:10:39.637 --> 00:10:42.303
A PROPER MEMBER OF THE KENDO
CLUB SHOULD KNOW BETTER

00:10:42.303 --> 00:10:44.037
THAN TO EVER
THROW HIS SHINAI SWORD.

00:10:44.037 --> 00:10:47.137
BUT...THAT’S PROBABLY
WHY YOU CAN’T MAKE THE TEAM.

00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:49.437
( laughs )

00:10:49.437 --> 00:10:51.737
HE JUST ACCELERATED!

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:53.737
THERE’S NO OTHER EXPLANATION.

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.837
NOMI <i>HAS</i> TO BE
A BURST LINKER!

00:10:55.837 --> 00:10:58.203
NOW I JUST NEED
TO GET SOME PROOF.

00:10:58.203 --> 00:11:00.903
( groaning, whimpering )

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.003
HE’S HEADING TO THE SHOWERS.

00:11:23.003 --> 00:11:24.770
( panting )

00:11:29.003 --> 00:11:30.070
( gasps )

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.270
( thinking )
<i>HERE’S MY CHANCE</i>
<i>TO GET SOME HARD PROOF.</i>

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.737
( gulps )

00:11:50.237 --> 00:11:51.403
( grunts )

00:11:55.037 --> 00:11:56.170
( gasps )

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.003
<i>HIS NEURO-LINKER.</i>

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.470
<i>IF I CABLE LINK TO THIS,</i>

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.870
<i>I CAN SEARCH</i>
<i>FOR THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM.</i>

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.037
( grunts softly )

00:12:07.037 --> 00:12:08.337
( gulps )

00:12:08.337 --> 00:12:09.470
( sighs )

00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:13.337
HUH?

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.937
WAIT, IS THIS...?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.403
( gasps )

00:12:20.503 --> 00:12:22.003
( Chiyuri gasps )

00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:23.403
CHI--

00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:24.703
CHIYU?

00:12:31.142 --> 00:12:35.381
( whimpering )
HARU, WHAT THE HECK
ARE YOU DOING

00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:36.581
IN THE GIRLS’ SHOWERS?

00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:38.214
WHAT?! THE GIRLS’ SHOWERS?!

00:12:38.214 --> 00:12:40.481
NO WAY!
I’M SURE THAT I--

00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:41.781
( grunts )

00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:43.148
( gasping )

00:12:43.148 --> 00:12:45.114
HARU!
( girls laughing )

00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:46.614
Girl 1: I’M EXHAUSTED.
( yells )

00:12:46.614 --> 00:12:48.114
Girl 2: YEAH, ME, TOO.

00:12:48.114 --> 00:12:50.581
I CAN’T WAIT
TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.
RIGHT?

00:12:50.581 --> 00:12:51.681
WANNA GO GRAB A BITE?

00:12:51.681 --> 00:12:53.148
SURE. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

00:12:54.848 --> 00:12:56.214
( gasping )

00:12:56.214 --> 00:12:58.614
Chiyuri: STAND STILL
AND DON’T SAY ANYTHING.

00:12:58.614 --> 00:13:00.648
Girl 1: AH, GEEZ,
I FEEL SO GROSS.

00:13:00.648 --> 00:13:03.448
Girl 2: YEAH, I KNOW--I REALLY
NEED TO HIT THE SHOWERS.

00:13:03.448 --> 00:13:05.581
( whispers )
If they see you,
you’ll get expelled.

00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:07.981
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:10.248
I KNOW I
CHECKED THOSE SIGNS.

00:13:12.181 --> 00:13:15.514
HOLD ON. WAS THAT
AN ELECTRONIC VISUAL MASKING?

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:17.048
HUH? A WHAT?

00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:19.648
IT OVERRIDES THE VISUAL FIELD
IN YOUR NEURO-LINKER.

00:13:19.648 --> 00:13:21.214
YOU CAN DO THINGS
LIKE SWITCH SIGNS

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:22.914
SO YOU THINK YOU’RE
ENTERING THE BOYS’ SHOWER

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:24.248
WHEN YOU’RE REALLY
ENTERING THE GIRLS’.

00:13:24.248 --> 00:13:26.281
NOMI TOTALLY SET A
TRAP FOR ME.

00:13:26.281 --> 00:13:28.514
Girl 2: HEY, CHI,
ARE YOU STILL IN THERE?
( gasps )

00:13:28.514 --> 00:13:31.048
UH, YEAH. I CAN’T
BELIEVE THAT WORKOUT TODAY.

00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:32.914
I GOT SUPER SWEATY.
I KNOW, RIGHT?

00:13:32.914 --> 00:13:36.314
THAT COACH WAS PUSHING US
WAY TOO HARD FOR THE UPCOMING
DISTRICT QUALIFIERS.

00:13:36.314 --> 00:13:38.714
Girl 1: ISN’T THAT WATER
WAY TOO HOT FOR YOU, CHI?

00:13:38.714 --> 00:13:40.248
IT’S REALLY STEAMY IN HERE.

00:13:40.248 --> 00:13:42.014
Chiyuri: NO, I LOVE IT
HOT LIKE THIS.

00:13:42.014 --> 00:13:43.848
IT’S GOOD FOR YOUR
CIRCULATION, TOO.

00:13:43.848 --> 00:13:45.214
OH, SHUT UP.

00:13:45.214 --> 00:13:47.514
YOU’RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE
MY GRANDMA NOW.

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:50.681
( giggling )

00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.848
( other shower turns on )
<i>I’M SORRY.</i>

00:13:53.848 --> 00:13:56.281
<i>I’M SO SORRY.</i>
<i>I TOTALLY SCREWED UP.</i>

00:13:56.281 --> 00:13:57.681
NOW’S YOUR CHANCE.
( grunts )

00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:59.981
OKAY, GO!
( panting )

00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:02.448
( grunts, whimpers )

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:03.381
( sighs )

00:14:04.614 --> 00:14:06.014
( groans softly )

00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:12.314
I’M SORRY!
I REALLY MEAN IT!

00:14:12.314 --> 00:14:13.648
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:15.648
( Chiyuri growls )

00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:18.981
( whimpering )

00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:21.081
YOU’RE PICTURING ME
NAKED AGAIN, RIGHT?!

00:14:21.081 --> 00:14:23.581
NO! I WASN’T!
I SWEAR I WASN’T!
( grunts )

00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:25.448
( grunts )

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:26.848
LET’S MOVE ON.

00:14:26.848 --> 00:14:28.748
THAT ELECTRONIC
VISUAL THINGY--

00:14:28.748 --> 00:14:30.381
WHEN DID HE HAVE A CHANCE
TO DO IT?

00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:32.081
WELL...I DON’T KNOW.

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:34.414
WHY’S EVERYONE
ACTING SO CRAZY?

00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.614
I MEAN, IT’S JUST A GAME.

00:14:35.614 --> 00:14:36.748
IT’S INSANE.

00:14:37.614 --> 00:14:38.681
LOOK, AT ITS CORE,

00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:40.314
BRAIN BURST <i>IS</i> A GAME.

00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:42.448
BUT IT’S REALLY
MORE THAN THAT.
SEE, FOR PEOPLE LIKE NOMI

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.648
WHO USE ACCELERATION
TO UP THEIR STATUS
IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:45.848
IT’S EVERYTHING.

00:14:45.848 --> 00:14:47.614
AND THEY’LL DO WHATEVER
THEY HAVE TO

00:14:47.614 --> 00:14:48.714
TO PROTECT THEIR POWER.

00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:51.048
HARU, I REALLY
DON’T LIKE THIS!

00:14:51.048 --> 00:14:53.448
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING THIS THING
WAY TOO FAR!

00:14:53.448 --> 00:14:54.848
YOU KEEP SAYING IT’S A GAME,

00:14:54.848 --> 00:14:56.314
BUT YOU, TAKU, AND NOMI

00:14:56.314 --> 00:14:58.114
DON’T SEEM TO BE HAVING
ANY FUN AT IT.

00:14:58.114 --> 00:14:59.848
NO, THAT ISN’T TRUE AT ALL!

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:01.881
AND TO BE HONEST, I THINK THAT
THANKS TO BRAIN BURST,

00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:03.414
I’VE ACTUALLY CHANGED A BIT.

00:15:03.414 --> 00:15:06.248
IT’S WHAT LET TAKU AND ME
CONFRONT EACH OTHER HONESTLY.

00:15:06.248 --> 00:15:07.948
AND I ALSO THINK THAT
BECAUSE OF THIS GAME,

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:10.081
I’M A LITTLE LESS
OF A COWARD NOW, TOO.

00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:12.381
YEAH, WELL
I GUESS <i>THAT</i> PART’S TRUE,

00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:15.448
’CAUSE I HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT IF THE OLD YOU
HAD SEEN ME NAKED,

00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.281
YOU WOULD’VE AVOIDED ME
FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH

00:15:17.281 --> 00:15:19.414
AND NEVER HAD THE GUTS
TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT.

00:15:19.414 --> 00:15:20.414
AH!

00:15:20.414 --> 00:15:21.914
I AM REALLY SORRY.
I MEAN IT.

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:23.981
I’M SUCH AN IDIOT.
IT’S ALL MY FAULT.

00:15:23.981 --> 00:15:25.881
IT’S OVER!
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT!

00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:29.381
BUT IF I EVER FIND OUT
THAT YOU MENTIONED A WORD
OF THIS TO TAKKUN,

00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:31.748
THEN I PROMISE I REALLY
WILL KILL YOU.

00:15:31.748 --> 00:15:33.881
OKAY, I WON’T TELL TAKU.

00:15:33.881 --> 00:15:36.481
IF YOU DO,
I’LL TELL KUROYUKI SENPAI

00:15:36.481 --> 00:15:38.614
THAT YOU’RE A DIRTY PERV.

00:15:38.614 --> 00:15:40.414
( whimpering )

00:15:41.581 --> 00:15:44.381
Taku: HEY, WHAT’S WRONG?
HUH?!

00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:47.481
EVER SINCE I SAW YOU
THIS MORNING, YOU’VE
BEEN ACTING KINDA WEIRD.

00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.614
REALLY? H-HAVE I?

00:15:49.614 --> 00:15:51.381
UH, ACTUALLY--
MMM?

00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:52.314
( groans )

00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:55.681
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:15:55.681 --> 00:15:57.981
OH, IT’S JUST...MY TUMMY.

00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.814
IT’S BEEN KIND OF MESSED UP
ALL MORNING.

00:15:59.814 --> 00:16:03.181
HMM?
I THINK I’D BETTER
HEAD TO THE RESTROOM.
( grunts softly )

00:16:03.181 --> 00:16:05.381
Female Computerized Voice:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:07.448
( breathing heavily )

00:16:07.448 --> 00:16:09.114
IT’S FROM NOMI.

00:16:16.714 --> 00:16:19.214
IS THIS WHERE HE’S
TALKING ABOUT?

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:22.314
( gasps )

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.448
GAME OVER, ARITA SENPAI.

00:16:25.448 --> 00:16:28.481
OR SHOULD I SAY,
"SILVER CROW"?

00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:29.714
( gasps )

00:16:29.714 --> 00:16:31.581
I WIN.

00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:33.714
AND THEREFORE, YOU LOSE.

00:16:33.714 --> 00:16:35.814
WAIT! NOBODY’S
WON ANYTHING YET!

00:16:35.814 --> 00:16:36.881
( panting )

00:16:36.881 --> 00:16:38.181
( grunts softly )

00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.214
WE HAVEN’T EVEN
FOUGHT EACH OTHER.

00:16:40.214 --> 00:16:42.381
AND THE ONLY REASON FOR THAT
IS BECAUSE <i>YOU’VE</i> DONE SOMETHING

00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:44.148
TO HIDE YOUR NAME
ON THE MATCHING LIST.

00:16:44.148 --> 00:16:46.014
WHAT’S THE POINT
OF SOME SILLY DUEL?

00:16:46.014 --> 00:16:47.448
THERE’S NO NEED FOR IT.

00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:49.748
NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE THIS.

00:16:49.748 --> 00:16:51.581
( electronic ringing )
( sighs )

00:16:51.581 --> 00:16:53.181
OPEN IT.
IT’S OKAY.

00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:56.714
AND THIS FILE DOESN’T
COME WITH A VIRUS.
I PROMISE.

00:16:56.714 --> 00:16:58.448
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, <i>"THIS</i> FILE"?

00:16:58.448 --> 00:16:59.381
( gasps )

00:17:00.848 --> 00:17:02.714
WAIT, DID YOU PUT THAT
ELECTRONIC VISUAL MASK

00:17:02.714 --> 00:17:04.181
ON THE CLASS PHOTO?

00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:06.748
I MAY HAVE INSTALLED A PROGRAM
IN THE NAMETAG

00:17:06.748 --> 00:17:09.714
THAT MESSES A BIT
WITH YOUR VISUAL FIELD.

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:11.048
AND ALTHOUGH YOU
FIGURED IT OUT,

00:17:11.048 --> 00:17:13.714
YOUR POOR BEST FRIEND
DIDN’T AT ALL.

00:17:18.781 --> 00:17:20.281
( gasps )

00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:22.781
ALL RIGHT. HOW DID YOU
TAKE THIS FOOTAGE?

00:17:22.781 --> 00:17:24.981
SEE? I WENT ALL OLD-SCHOOL.

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:28.114
I STRATEGICALLY PLANTED IT
IN THE GIRLS’ SHOWER ROOM.

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:30.048
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ONE
OF TEN TRAPS

00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:31.714
I HAD SET AROUND THE SCHOOL.

00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:33.781
THIS ONE WAS THE LONG-SHOT.

00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:35.648
WHO WOULD’VE THOUGHT IT
WOULD ACTUALLY WORK?

00:17:35.648 --> 00:17:36.981
CRAZY, RIGHT?

00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:38.581
( laughing )
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:17:38.581 --> 00:17:41.014
ARE YOU REALLY THAT DESPERATE
TO GET RID OF SILVER CROW?

00:17:41.014 --> 00:17:43.914
WHAT? IS YOUR MASTER PLAN
TO TRY AND GET ME EXPELLED?

00:17:43.914 --> 00:17:45.314
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:46.581
DON’T BE SILLY.

00:17:46.581 --> 00:17:48.981
WHAT DO I GET OUT OF YOU
BEING EXPELLED?

00:17:48.981 --> 00:17:50.381
THAT DOESN’T BENEFIT ME.

00:17:50.381 --> 00:17:53.714
I JUST WANT TO IMPROVE
MY OVERALL SCHOOL EXPERIENCE.

00:17:53.714 --> 00:17:55.114
AND I PLAN TO DO THAT

00:17:55.114 --> 00:17:58.281
BY TURNING YOU INTO MY LOYAL,
OBEDIENT LITTLE DOG...

00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:01.914
A CLEVER DOG WHO KNOWS THE ONLY
WAY TO SAVE HIS OWN HIDE

00:18:01.914 --> 00:18:04.048
IS BY GIVING ME
BURST POINTS DAILY.

00:18:04.048 --> 00:18:06.781
( gasping )
Chiyuri: I WON’T
LET YOU DO THAT!

00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:09.881
( grunts softly )
HARU WENT INTO THE GIRL’S
SHOWER ROOM

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.281
BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO.

00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:13.581
AND IF HE CHOOSES
TO MAKE THAT VIDEO PUBLIC,

00:18:13.581 --> 00:18:14.948
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I’LL SAY.

00:18:14.948 --> 00:18:16.214
I ASKED HIM THERE

00:18:16.214 --> 00:18:18.414
BECAUSE I SPRAINED
MY ANKLE SO BADLY,

00:18:18.414 --> 00:18:19.548
I COULDN’T WALK ON MY OWN.

00:18:19.548 --> 00:18:21.314
CHIYU.

00:18:21.314 --> 00:18:22.781
NICELY DONE.

00:18:22.781 --> 00:18:25.481
I ADMIT I’M RATHER IMPRESSED,
KURASHIMA SENPAI.

00:18:25.481 --> 00:18:28.981
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER
THAT YOU’RE A BRAND-NEW
BURST-LINKER.

00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.314
STOP TRYING
TO BE THE TOUGH GUY!

00:18:30.314 --> 00:18:32.114
YOUR LITTLE ACT
IS OVER, OKAY?

00:18:32.114 --> 00:18:33.881
THAT VIDEO WON’T
BE OF ANY USE NOW.

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:36.614
YEAH. I’M NOT
SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

00:18:36.614 --> 00:18:38.781
LET’S PICTURE THIS:

00:18:38.781 --> 00:18:40.114
<i>RIGHT ABOUT NOW,</i>

00:18:40.114 --> 00:18:42.048
<i>SOMEONE’S GONNA</i>
<i>FIND ANOTHER CAMERA</i>

00:18:42.048 --> 00:18:44.848
<i>JUST LIKE THIS ONE</i>
<i>HIDDEN IN THE GIRLS’</i>
<i>SHOWER ROOM.</i>

00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:46.981
<i>WHAT DO YOU</i>
<i>THINK HAPPENS NEXT?</i>

00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:50.281
IT’LL CAUSE A HUGE FUSS
AND A BIG SEARCH
FOR THE CULPRIT.

00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:54.448
NOW, IF I UPLOADED THIS VIDEO
HERE ONTO THE LOCAL NET,

00:18:54.448 --> 00:18:56.848
TELL ME, KURASHIMA SENPAI,

00:18:56.848 --> 00:19:00.148
WOULD YOUR COVER-UP STILL
BE ENOUGH TO SAVE YOUR FRIEND?

00:19:00.148 --> 00:19:01.014
( gasps )

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:02.548
YOU’D GO THAT FAR?

00:19:02.548 --> 00:19:05.048
SERIOUSLY?
( bell ringing )

00:19:05.048 --> 00:19:09.981
Man: <i>WE HAVE AN URGENT MESSAGE</i>
<i>FROM THE UMESATO JUNIOR HIGH</i>
<i>ADMINISTRATION.</i>

00:19:09.981 --> 00:19:12.981
<i>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,</i>
<i>ALL STUDENTS ARE FORBIDDEN</i>

00:19:12.981 --> 00:19:15.148
<i>FROM ENTERING THE AREA</i>
<i>INDICATED HERE ON THE MAP.</i>

00:19:15.148 --> 00:19:18.414
WELL NOW, IT SEEMS THEY
FOUND THE CAMERA AT LAST.

00:19:18.414 --> 00:19:20.114
BUT THAT’S TO BE EXPECTED

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:23.414
SINCE I SET THE RECORD LIGHT
TO START BLINKING
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

00:19:23.414 --> 00:19:24.981
ARE YOU TOTALLY WHACKED?

00:19:24.981 --> 00:19:27.314
GOING TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
JUST TO GET AHEAD IN SOME GAME?

00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:28.314
GET REAL!

00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:29.748
THERE’S A QUESTION

00:19:29.748 --> 00:19:31.514
THAT I’D LIKE TO ASK YOU,

00:19:31.514 --> 00:19:33.014
SENPAI.

00:19:33.014 --> 00:19:36.014
DO YOU STILL HONESTLY
THINK THAT WAY?
( gasps )

00:19:36.014 --> 00:19:37.848
THAT BRAIN BURST
IS JUST A GAME?

00:19:37.848 --> 00:19:39.148
( gasps )

00:19:39.148 --> 00:19:40.548
( whimpering )

00:19:40.548 --> 00:19:43.581
( groans )
AND DON’T EVER TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT AGAIN.

00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:44.714
IT’S RUDE.

00:19:44.714 --> 00:19:47.114
AFTER ALL,
YOU HAVE TO OBEY ME, TOO.

00:19:47.114 --> 00:19:48.981
ISN’T THAT RIGHT?
( gasps )

00:19:50.748 --> 00:19:52.948
I’VE GOT BIG PLANS FOR YOU.

00:19:52.948 --> 00:19:55.248
YOU’LL BE MY
SPECIAL PET, OKAY?

00:19:55.248 --> 00:19:56.414
( whimpering )

00:19:56.414 --> 00:19:59.514
EVERY SINGLE TIME
I DUEL IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:19:59.514 --> 00:20:01.148
YOU’LL BE THERE TO SERVE ME.

00:20:01.148 --> 00:20:03.414
IT’S ALL RIGHT.
DON’T GET TOO UPSET.

00:20:03.414 --> 00:20:07.681
I DON’T INTEND TO MAKE YOU
DO SOMETHING AGAINST YOUR WILL
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:20:07.681 --> 00:20:10.581
OR PERHAPS I SHOULD
SAY NOT RIGHT NOW.

00:20:10.581 --> 00:20:11.981
( whimpering )
( laughing )

00:20:11.981 --> 00:20:14.081
YOU...SON OF A...

00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:16.414
( panting )
NO ONE SAID YOU COULD MOVE.

00:20:16.414 --> 00:20:18.014
I TOLD YOU, DIDN’T I?

00:20:18.014 --> 00:20:19.814
GAME OVER.
YOU’RE DONE.

00:20:19.814 --> 00:20:22.314
NOW JUST SIT THERE
AND BE A GOOD LITTLE DOGGIE,

00:20:22.314 --> 00:20:23.314
ALL RIGHT?

00:20:23.314 --> 00:20:26.681
SORRY. I MEAN "SENPAI."

00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:27.681
( whimpering )

00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:30.314
( squeals )
( laughing )

00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:31.948
( whimpering )

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:36.781
NOMI!!!

00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:38.181
( no audible dialogue )

00:20:38.181 --> 00:20:39.281
( gasps )

00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:41.181
Both: PHYSICAL BURST.

00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:46.948
( thinking )
<i>I SHOULDN’T BE DOING THIS...</i>

00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:51.048
<i>BUT...I HAVE NO CHOICE.</i>

00:20:51.048 --> 00:20:54.348
<i>I CAN’T JUST STAND THERE</i>
<i>AND LET THIS NOMI CREEP</i>
<i>GET AWAY WITH THIS.</i>

00:20:54.348 --> 00:20:56.348
<i>IT’S ONE THING</i>
<i>TO COME AFTER ME.</i>

00:20:56.348 --> 00:20:57.981
<i>BUT NOT CHIYU!</i>

00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:08.848
<i>DAMN IT.</i>

00:21:11.514 --> 00:21:12.814
HARU!
( blow landing )

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.681
( grunting )

00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:17.914
OH, WOW, YOU REALLY
DO SUCK AT THIS, SENPAI.

00:21:17.914 --> 00:21:20.448
I GOTTA SAY IT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN PRETTY OBVIOUS

00:21:20.448 --> 00:21:23.081
WHEN YOU’RE FIGHTING
IN A PHYSICALLY
ACCELERATED STATE,

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:25.514
IT’S ALL ABOUT USING
ANTICIPATION AND FEINTS.

00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:28.948
( whimpering )
I DON’T THINK I EVEN NEEDED
TO USE THAT COMMAND WITH YOU.

00:21:28.948 --> 00:21:31.914
I JUST WASTED FIVE
WHOLE POINTS.
( groaning )

00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:34.781
( laughing )

00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:37.714
WE STILL HAVE THREE MINUTES
BEFORE CLASS STARTS UP AGAIN.

00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.481
THAT SHOULD BE PLENTY OF TIME.

00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:41.981
YOU SAID YOU WANTED THE TWO
OF US TO HAVE A DUEL?

00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:44.948
THEN WHY DON’T WE
GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

00:21:44.948 --> 00:21:46.848
