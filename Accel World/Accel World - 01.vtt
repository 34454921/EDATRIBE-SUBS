WEBVTT

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.502
Teacher: LASTLY,
THE PRINTING PRESS... ALL RIGHT.

00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:12.002
SO WHEN YOU ADD THAT
TO THE LIST ALONG WITH--

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.636
Computer:
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:14.869
Teacher: ALONG WITH
THE COMPASS AND GUNPOWDER

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.271
YOU HAVE WHAT IS
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.271
THE THREE GREAT INVENTIONS
OF THE RENAISSANCE AGE.

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:22.471
NOW...
HOW HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:24.071
WERE EACH OF THESE INVENTIONS?

00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:27.837
WELL, IF YOU WERE TO COMPARE
THESE TO AN INVENTION FROM

00:00:27.837 --> 00:00:31.537
THE 21st CENTURY IT WOULD BE
EQUIVALENT TO THE INVENTION

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:33.871
OF THE QUANTUM MOBILE
COMPUTER TERMINAL,

00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.404
WHAT WE CALL THE NEURO-LINKER.

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:39.237
THIS HAS BEEN, BY FAR,
ONE OF THE GREATEST INVENTIONS--

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:41.637
( loud electronic sounds,
Haru gasping )

00:00:41.637 --> 00:00:44.237
THE NEURO-LINKER CREATED
AN IT REVOLUTION THAT AFFECTED

00:00:44.237 --> 00:00:46.904
THE DAILY LIVES
OF EVERY MEMBER OF SOCIETY.

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:48.371
( Araya laughing)

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.871
BRING ME TWO YAKISOBA BUNS,
ONE MELON CREAM BUN,

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:54.337
AND A STRAWBERRY YOGURT
TO THE ROOF AT LUNCHTIME TODAY.

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.004
AND DON’T BE LATE, OR ELSE.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.604
Teacher: ALL RIGHT. I THINK
I’VE MADE THIS PRETTY CLEAR

00:00:57.604 --> 00:00:59.304
HOWEVER, IF THERE ARE
ANY QUESTIONS, CLASS,

00:00:59.304 --> 00:01:02.171
NOW WOULD BE
THE TIME TO ASK THEM.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.000
( grunts )

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.767
AW, STOP BEING
SO SCARED,
PUDGE BOY.

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.567
AS LONG AS WE STAY
OUT OF SIGHT FROM
THE SECURITY CAMERAS,

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.034
NO ONE CAN SEE A THING.
( chuckles )

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:18.500
YO, WHAT’S THIS CRAP?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.667
WHY AM I HOLDING
ONLY ONE YAKISOBA BUN?

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.067
Haru: IT WAS ALL
THAT WAS LEFT.
COME ON!

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:24.667
YOU CAN’T EVEN
HANDLE A SIMPLE ERRAND?

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.400
LISTEN HERE, PIGGY.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.134
TOMORROW I WANT
TWO MELON CREAM BUNS

00:01:28.134 --> 00:01:29.667
AND FIVE STRAWBERRY YOGURTS.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.234
AND YOU BETTER HOPE TO GOD
YOU DON’T SCREW IT UP.

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:35.034
THIS IS YOUR FINAL LAST CHANCE,
YOU GOT THAT?

00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:37.434
WHY WOULD YOU CALL SOMETHING
YOUR “FINAL LAST CHANCE”?

00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:39.134
THAT’S COMPLETELY REDUNDANT.

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:40.600
BONEHEAD.
BONEHEAD.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.867
BONEHEAD!

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.134
( sighs )

00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:47.134
IF I COULD JUST
SAY THAT TO HIS FACE.

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:49.767
( stomach rumbles )

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:51.700
( sighs )

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:00.034
( beeps )

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:07.000
OPEN DIRECT LINK.
( beeping )

00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:19.267
SORRY I’M LATE.
LET’S GO.

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:23.300
( grunting )

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:46.234
Girl: LOOK! IT’S
THE STUDENT VICE PRESIDENT!

00:02:46.234 --> 00:02:48.667
Girl Two:
WOW, SHE’S PRETTY.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:50.934
( indistinct chatter )

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.634
THAT’D BE SO AWESOME.
( giggling )

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:01.167
SO, KUROYUKIHIME...

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:03.534
HOW DO YOU CREATE
SUCH AWESOME AVATARS?

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.767
MINE DON’T COME OUT
LOOKING NEARLY AS COOL.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:09.000
IT’S NOT EASY
TO TRY AND DESIGN
YOUR TRUE NATURE.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.634
HOW’D YOU GET
THAT GLOSSY TEXTURE?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.134
Whoop.
( groaning )

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.267
( indistinct chatter )

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:26.200
Girl: WOW!
KUROYUKIHIME LOOKED AT ME!

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.200
( chatter continues )

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:33.300
( panting )

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.100
Haru: <i>WHAT AM I GETTING</i>
<i>SO WORKED UP ABOUT?</i>

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.834
<i>GIRLS LIKE THAT</i>
<i>ARE NEVER GONNA BE</i>

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:38.934
<i>INTERESTED IN SOMEONE LIKE ME.</i>

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.900
<i>THIS IS IT.</i>

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.267
<i>THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE I HAVE.</i>

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:11.500
( grunts )

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.900
<i>HERE, I’M AN AMAZING ATHLETE.</i>

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.867
<i>WHO NEEDS THAT</i>
<i>CRAPPY REALITY ANYWAY?</i>

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:18.000
( grunting )

00:04:19.434 --> 00:04:21.034
<i>REAL CLASSROOMS ARE LAME.</i>

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:22.600
<i>WHY DO WE STILL EVEN HAVE THEM?</i>

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:28.234
<i>WHY CAN’T EVERYTHING BE</i>
<i>IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD?</i>

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.367
<i>DAMN IT!</i>

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:38.800
<i>FASTER.</i>
<i>I WANNA GO FASTER.</i>

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.400
<i>IN THIS THIS WORLD...</i>
<i>AND THE REAL ONE.</i>

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.167
<i>FAST ENOUGH TO LEAVE EVERYONE</i>
<i>BEHIND AND GO SOMEWHERE...</i>

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.534
<i>NO ONE ELSE CAN!</i>

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.667
( bells, cheering )

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.900
Girl: AHA!
Haru: AHH!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.700
SO, THIS IS WHERE
YOU’RE HIDING!

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.667
I’VE SPENT MY ENTIRE
LUNCH BREAK TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHERE YOU ARE.

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:19.267
HUH! WHAT IS ALL THIS?

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:23.867
YOU’RE ON LEVEL 152,
WITH 2,630,000 POINTS?!

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.200
YOU’RE...

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.567
A COMPLETE IDIOT!
AHH!

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:29.934
THIS IS INSANE.
COME ON, LINK OUT NOW!

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:32.534
IT’S MY LIFE,
I’LL DO WHAT I WANT.

00:05:32.534 --> 00:05:33.734
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.034
OH, OKAY.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:36.767
SO THAT’S HOW YOU’RE
GOING TO BE, HUH?

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:38.100
FINE, LINK OUT!

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.100
HMPF.

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:48.634
( grunts )

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:52.000
AH!

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.834
CHIYU?! WHAT’RE
YOU DOING HERE?

00:05:53.834 --> 00:05:56.867
HMM. ( giggles )
I HIT YOU WITH
A FORCED LINK OUT!

00:05:56.867 --> 00:05:58.667
THAT MEANS I WIN!

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:01.167
YOU DO REALIZE THIS
IS THE BOY’S RESTROOM
YOU’RE IN!

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:02.400
HAVE YOU GONE CRAZY?

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.967
YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO’S CRAZY.

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:06.900
SO HOW DID YOU
EVEN FIND ME ANYWAY?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.400
( sighs )

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.967
WELL, I SAW
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:12.300
( gasps )

00:06:13.534 --> 00:06:16.034
HARU, WHY DON’T YOU
SHOW THOSE EMAILS

00:06:16.034 --> 00:06:17.667
THEY SEND YOU TO A
TEACHER OR SOMETHING?

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.067
MAYBE IF I’M LUCKY
THEY’LL GET SUSPENDED.

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:21.634
BUT THEN THEY’LL
JUST COME BACK.

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:23.534
THEN, WHY DON’T YOU
TELL TAKU ABOUT IT?

00:06:23.534 --> 00:06:24.934
I’M SURE
HE WOULD BE HAP--

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.134
DON’T TELL TAKU
ABOUT THIS!

00:06:27.134 --> 00:06:29.500
I’M FINE, OKAY.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.234
I’VE ACCEPTED THAT THIS
IS WHAT SCHOOL IS FOR ME.

00:06:32.234 --> 00:06:34.200
I’M A LOSER.
I KNOW THAT.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.400
SO DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.934
H-HOLD ON A SEC.
AT LEAST TAKE THIS.

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:39.567
IT’S LUNCHTIME.
YOU NEED TO EAT.

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.167
HERE. I MADE
ALL YOUR FAVORITES.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.934
GO AWAY!
( gasps )

00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:52.534
I DON’T WANT IT!

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.234
( whimpers )

00:07:00.134 --> 00:07:01.800
Haru: <i>I KNOW I SHOULD</i>
<i>APOLOGIZE TO HER,</i>

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.134
<i>SO WHY CAN’T</i>
<i>I MAKE MYSELF DO IT?</i>

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:05.334
<i>I’M SUCH A COWARD!</i>

00:07:05.334 --> 00:07:09.067
<i>CHIYURI... SHE WAS CRYING.</i>

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.700
DIRECT LINK.

00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:25.734
( gasps )

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:28.667
LEVEL... 166?

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.400
THERE’S SOMEONE WHO’S
BETTER AT THIS THAN ME?

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.834
THIS WAS IT.
THIS WAS MY ONE THING!

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:39.034
I DON’T BELIEVE IT!

00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:41.267
VIRTUAL GAMES WERE ALL I HAD.

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:43.200
NOBODY COULD EVER BEAT ME HERE.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.267
( crying )
AT LEAST THAT’S WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:51.134
Girl: WERE YOU THE ONE
WHO WAS ABLE

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:53.000
TO GET THAT
RIDICULOUSLY HIGH SCORE?

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.234
WANT TO ACCELERATE?

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:03.600
WANT TO TAKE THIS EVEN FURTHER,
YOUNG MAN?

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:14.028
IF SO, SCHOOL LOUNGE,
LUNCH TOMORROW.

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:15.495
( gasps )

00:08:17.762 --> 00:08:20.928
COULD THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN HER?

00:08:20.928 --> 00:08:22.795
( indistinct chatter )

00:08:37.595 --> 00:08:38.995
HEY THERE!
HUH?

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:40.195
WHAT’S WRONG?

00:08:40.195 --> 00:08:41.728
DO YOU NEED
SOMETHING?

00:08:41.728 --> 00:08:45.095
WELL, I...
I JUST... UM...

00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:46.295
Girl: WHO’S THE FAT KID?

00:08:46.295 --> 00:08:47.895
Boy: DOESN’T HE KNOW THAT

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.328
FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AREN’T
WELCOME IN THIS LOUNGE?

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.662
WELL, YOU SEE I...

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:52.095
Kuroyukihime:
AH, YOU’RE HERE.

00:08:52.095 --> 00:08:53.295
HUH?

00:08:53.295 --> 00:08:54.628
HUH?
HUH?

00:08:58.228 --> 00:09:00.495
IT’S ALL RIGHT EVERYBODY.
HE’S WITH ME.

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:02.995
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND AS
TO LET HIM COME THROUGH.

00:09:02.995 --> 00:09:04.528
HUH...
MMM...

00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:15.295
WAIT A SEC...
BUT HIME...

00:09:18.595 --> 00:09:20.628
SORRY, UM,
WHAT’S THIS FOR?

00:09:20.628 --> 00:09:21.995
NOTHING TO BE
ALARMED ABOUT,

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.995
JUST PLUG IT INTO
YOUR DEVICE.
WHAT?!

00:09:23.995 --> 00:09:25.395
BUT PEOPLE ONLY DO
THIS WHEN THEY’RE,

00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:26.862
LIKE, DATING EACH OTHER.

00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:27.995
AHH!

00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:37.195
SORRY FOR DRAGGING YOU ALL
THE WAY HERE, HARUYUKI ARITA.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:40.095
CAN YOU USE NEURO SPEAK?

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:41.995
YES, BUT...

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:44.695
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

00:09:44.695 --> 00:09:47.362
IS THIS SOME SORT OF
ELABORATE PRANK OR SOMETHING?

00:09:47.362 --> 00:09:50.295
WELL, I GUESS
IN SOME WAYS, IT IS.

00:09:50.295 --> 00:09:51.628
YOU SEE...

00:09:53.962 --> 00:09:57.495
WHAT I’M ABOUT TO DO IS
SEND YOU AN APPLICATION.

00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.795
I’M SENDING IT DIRECTLY
TO YOUR NEURO-LINKER.

00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:08.262
Computer voice:
<i>LOAD APPLICATION?</i>

00:10:08.262 --> 00:10:09.462
IF YOU ACCEPT IT,

00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:11.728
YOUR CURRENT REALITY
WILL BE DESTROYED.

00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:14.228
REBUILT IN ITS PLACE
WILL BE A WORLD

00:10:14.228 --> 00:10:15.795
LIKE YOU HAVE
NEVER DREAMED OF.

00:10:15.795 --> 00:10:18.095
Haru:
<i>SHE WANTS TO DESTROY...</i>

00:10:18.095 --> 00:10:19.428
<i>MY REALITY?</i>

00:10:22.262 --> 00:10:23.728
THAT’S PERFECT.

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:26.328
IF IT CAN DESTROY MY REALITY,
LET’S DO IT.

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:48.928
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT...

00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:50.862
THIS BRAIN BURST PROGRAM?

00:10:50.862 --> 00:10:53.462
I’LL EXPLAIN ONCE
IT’S SAFELY INSTALLED.

00:10:53.462 --> 00:10:54.995
UM..."SAFELY"?

00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:59.195
INSTALLATION FAILURES
ARE NOT INCREDIBLY UNCOMMON.

00:10:59.195 --> 00:11:01.328
HUH?!

00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:15.095
"WELCOME TO..."

00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:17.028
"THE ACCELERATED WORLD"?

00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:20.062
I HAD A FEELING YOU’D
BE OKAY WITH THIS PROGRAM.

00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:22.028
GLAD TO SEE I WASN’T WRONG.

00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:25.728
YOU KNOW, IT TOOK A GOOD
TWO MINUTES FOR ME TO DECIDE

00:11:25.728 --> 00:11:28.395
WHETHER OR NOT I WANTED
TO ACCEPT THIS PROGRAM.

00:11:28.395 --> 00:11:30.128
I PREPARED A LITTLE SPEECH,

00:11:30.128 --> 00:11:33.795
BUT I CAN SEE NO PERSUASION
WAS NEEDED ON YOU.

00:11:33.795 --> 00:11:35.028
UH...

00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:37.162
Boy: HEY!
FAT ASS!

00:11:37.162 --> 00:11:40.128
THINK YOU WERE GONNA GET
AWAY WITH THIS, DID ’YA?

00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:43.828
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING
ME MY MELON BUNS AND YOGURT.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:45.028
NOW YOU GOTTA PAY.

00:11:45.028 --> 00:11:46.228
Hime: WELL,
HELLO THERE.

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:47.628
HUH?

00:11:47.628 --> 00:11:49.495
YOU’RE ARAYA,
CORRECT?
( chuckling )

00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:51.095
YOUR FRIEND HERE HAS
TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU.

00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:52.295
HUH?

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.928
ABOUT THE MIX UP.

00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:56.062
HOW YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE SENT TO A ZOO,

00:11:56.062 --> 00:11:58.728
BUT SOMEHOW ENDED UP
AT OUR SCHOOL INSTEAD.

00:11:58.728 --> 00:12:00.428
WAIT!
I DIDN’T SAY THAT!

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.328
Haru:
<i>WHAT’S SHE DOING?</i>

00:12:02.328 --> 00:12:03.728
<i>WHY’D SHE SAY THAT?</i>

00:12:03.728 --> 00:12:05.428
( clears throat )
( yells )

00:12:05.428 --> 00:12:08.162
SO...THAT’S
WHAT YOU TOLD HER?!

00:12:08.162 --> 00:12:09.928
THAT DOES IT!

00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:12.328
YOU ARE DEAD,
PIGGY!

00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:14.062
NOW!
SHOUT IT.

00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:15.862
BURST LINK!

00:12:15.862 --> 00:12:17.428
B-B-BURST LINK!

00:12:22.328 --> 00:12:24.328
( grunts )

00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.662
HUH?

00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:36.662
WHAT... IS THIS?

00:12:36.662 --> 00:12:39.995
I’D PREFER IT IF YOU
DIDN’T STARE AT MY LEGS.

00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:42.962
I HAD HOPED THEY WERE
OUTSIDE OF THE VIEW
OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS,

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:44.162
BUT THIS IS FINE.

00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:46.428
UM, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:47.762
WHAT WE’VE DONE IS UTILIZE

00:12:47.762 --> 00:12:50.428
ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS
OF THE BRAIN BURST PROGRAM.

00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:52.495
WE’VE SIMPLY...
ACCELERATED.

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:54.562
ACCELERATED?
EXACTLY.

00:12:54.562 --> 00:12:56.162
THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:12:56.162 --> 00:12:59.462
WE’RE NOW BOTH STANDING IN
THE REALM OF THE BURST LINKER.

00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:01.462
BURST LINKER?

00:13:01.462 --> 00:13:04.062
ACCELERATED WORLD?
WHAT?

00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:05.895
HMM.

00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:15.328
( groans )

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:24.895
IT WOULD APPEAR THAT
EVERYTHING AROUND US
HAS FROZEN IN TIME,

00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:26.095
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:28.028
( grunting )

00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:31.528
THIS BLUE WORLD
IS SIMPLY A 3-D
RECONSTRUCTION OF IMAGES.

00:13:31.528 --> 00:13:33.528
THESE IMAGES ARE
ALL PULLED FROM

00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:36.462
THE MULTIPLE SECURITY CAMERAS
HERE WITHIN THE LOUNGE.

00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:40.162
BY UTILIZING
ACCELERATED BRAINWAVES,

00:13:40.162 --> 00:13:43.195
WE ARE ABLE TO SEE
THIS WORLD THROUGH
OUR NEURO-LINKER.

00:13:43.195 --> 00:13:45.762
WE’VE ACCELERATED
OUR BRAINWAVES?

00:13:45.762 --> 00:13:48.662
YES, BY ABOUT ONE THOUSAND
TIMES THEIR NORMAL RATE.

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:49.928
HUH?

00:13:49.928 --> 00:13:51.328
SO ONE SECOND IN REALITY

00:13:51.328 --> 00:13:53.228
FEELS LIKE
ONE THOUSAND SECONDS.

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:57.462
IN THIS DIMENSION THAT’S
16 MINUTES AND 40 SECONDS.

00:13:58.995 --> 00:14:00.595
SO, THEN...

00:14:00.595 --> 00:14:03.128
BY USING THIS POWER...

00:14:03.128 --> 00:14:06.328
WHEN SOMEBODY SUCH AS YOURSELF
IS ABOUT TO GET PUNCHED,

00:14:06.328 --> 00:14:08.495
THEY CAN ACCELERATE
AT A CRITICAL MOMENT.

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:11.328
NOW YOU HAVE TIME TO ASSESS
THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION...

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:12.928
AND THEN PROCEED.

00:14:12.928 --> 00:14:14.295
I SEE.

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.428
I NEVER DREAMED THERE’D
BE A WAY TO AVOID GETTING HIT.

00:14:19.895 --> 00:14:21.762
BUT DON’T AVOID IT!

00:14:21.762 --> 00:14:22.995
WHAT?

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.495
YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE HE LANDS
THAT HIT GOOD AND HARD.

00:14:25.495 --> 00:14:26.695
HUH?
JUST TRUST ME.

00:14:26.695 --> 00:14:28.395
NO WAY!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

00:14:28.395 --> 00:14:30.428
THAT PUNCH IS GONNA
HURT LIKE HELL!

00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:32.695
BUT THIS IS YOUR CHANCE.
HUH?

00:14:32.695 --> 00:14:34.462
LOOK, HE KNOWS
WHAT HE’S DOING.

00:14:34.462 --> 00:14:35.862
HE AVOIDS
GETTING IN TROUBLE

00:14:35.862 --> 00:14:38.562
BY ALWAYS OPERATING OUTSIDE
THE VIEW OF THE CAMERAS.

00:14:38.562 --> 00:14:40.528
BUT I’VE PROVOKED HIM
AND HE REACTED.

00:14:40.528 --> 00:14:44.562
HE’S GONE AND LOST IT IN
FRONT OF SEVERAL CAMERAS
AND MULTIPLE WITNESSES.

00:14:44.562 --> 00:14:47.895
YOU NOW HAVE A PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGE.

00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:49.095
YEAH BUT...

00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:51.528
COULDN’T I USE BRAIN BURST TO...

00:14:51.528 --> 00:14:53.462
BEAT HIM IN A FIGHT INSTEAD?

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:55.362
YES, YOU COULD DO THAT.

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.462
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE
NOW A BURST LINKER

00:14:57.462 --> 00:14:59.562
WITH POWERS THAT NORMAL
PEOPLE CAN’T COMPETE WITH.

00:14:59.562 --> 00:15:04.328
( breathing heavily,
sighs )

00:15:04.328 --> 00:15:05.795
NO. OKAY,
YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:08.328
I’LL JUST STAND THERE
AND TAKE THE PUNCH.

00:15:08.328 --> 00:15:11.262
IT’S A PRETTY PERFECT CHANCE.

00:15:11.262 --> 00:15:12.462
HUH!

00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:15.495
YOU HAVE MADE
A VERY WISE CHOICE.

00:15:15.495 --> 00:15:18.462
LET’S MAKE THE MOST OF IT,
SHALL WE?
HOW?

00:15:18.462 --> 00:15:19.995
WHEN WE STOP ACCELERATION,

00:15:19.995 --> 00:15:22.595
THROW YOURSELF BACKWARDS
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

00:15:22.595 --> 00:15:24.728
BUT, IF I DO THAT
I’LL CRASH INTO YOU.

00:15:24.728 --> 00:15:27.462
YES. LIKE I SAID,
WE’RE MAKING THE MOST OF IT.

00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:29.228
DON’T WORRY ABOUT ME.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.862
I’VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

00:15:31.862 --> 00:15:34.062
ALL RIGHT.
PUT ON YOUR BEST SHOW.

00:15:34.062 --> 00:15:35.262
I’LL TRY.

00:15:35.262 --> 00:15:37.462
BURST OUT!

00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:39.562
B-BURST OUT!

00:15:45.195 --> 00:15:46.595
( both gasp )

00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:51.462
( grunting )

00:15:57.428 --> 00:15:59.528
Haru:
SENPAI?

00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:01.595
( everyone screaming )

00:16:01.595 --> 00:16:03.728
Man: <i>TEACHER!</i>
<i>GET A TEACHER!</i>

00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:06.062
ARE YOU OKAY?
Hime:
<i>LOOK HURT!</i>

00:16:06.062 --> 00:16:07.595
BUT--BUT
YOU’RE BLEEDING!

00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:10.095
<i>DON’T WORRY.</i>
<i>IT’S JUST A SMALL CUT.</i>

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.628
<i>LIKE I SAID,</i>
<i>WE’RE MAXIMIZING</i>
<i>THE DAMAGE HERE.</i>

00:16:13.628 --> 00:16:17.828
<i>THIS WAY, ARAYA WILL</i>
<i>NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN.</i>

00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:19.028
<i>EVER.</i>

00:16:19.028 --> 00:16:20.462
( gasps )

00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:22.328
THAT WAS VERY WELL DONE.

00:16:22.328 --> 00:16:24.662
HERE’S TO THE FUTURE
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP,

00:16:24.662 --> 00:16:26.195
HARUYUKI...

00:16:26.195 --> 00:16:28.295
( stammering )

00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:34.862
Hime: <i>I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,</i>
<i>DON’T REMOVE THE NEURO-LINKER</i>

00:16:34.862 --> 00:16:37.095
<i>UNTIL YOU’RE BACK</i>
<i>AT SCHOOL TOMORROW.</i>

00:16:37.095 --> 00:16:39.428
<i>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,</i>
<i>WHATEVER YOU DO,</i>

00:16:39.428 --> 00:16:41.328
<i>DO NOT CONNECT</i>
<i>TO THE GLOBAL NET.</i>

00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:42.662
<i>NOT EVEN FOR A SECOND!</i>

00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:44.995
<i>GOT IT?</i>
( sighs )

00:16:47.128 --> 00:16:49.528
Computer: <i>DISCONNECT</i>
<i>FROM THE GLOBAL NET?</i>

00:16:55.662 --> 00:16:57.262
CHIYU.

00:16:57.262 --> 00:17:00.062
Chiyu:
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED AT LUNCH.

00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:03.028
Haru:
HUH, AT LUNCH?
OH...

00:17:03.028 --> 00:17:05.828
THAT CREEP HITTING YOU
AND SENDING YOU FLYING.

00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:07.395
UH... YEAH.

00:17:07.395 --> 00:17:08.895
IS THAT FROM
THE INCIDENT?

00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:10.095
HUH?

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:12.262
THAT BANDAGE
ON YOUR FACE.

00:17:12.262 --> 00:17:13.528
ARE YOU OK?

00:17:13.528 --> 00:17:15.462
YEAH, I’M FINE.

00:17:15.462 --> 00:17:17.062
IT’S JUST A SCRATCH.

00:17:17.062 --> 00:17:18.595
WELL, THAT’S GOOD.

00:17:21.195 --> 00:17:25.195
HEY HARU, IS IS IT TRUE YOU
CABLE LINKED WITH KUROYUKIHIME?

00:17:25.195 --> 00:17:27.662
HUH?
WELL, UH... YEAH.

00:17:27.662 --> 00:17:29.062
HMM...

00:17:29.062 --> 00:17:30.995
HMM.

00:17:32.828 --> 00:17:34.328
HEY, BY THE WAY...

00:17:34.328 --> 00:17:36.062
ABOUT YESTERDAY...

00:17:36.062 --> 00:17:38.328
Boy:
HEY! HARU! CHI!

00:17:38.328 --> 00:17:39.695
( sighs )

00:17:40.795 --> 00:17:43.128
Haru: TAKU!

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.462
GREAT.
PERFECT TIMING.

00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:46.662
YOU HEADED HOME?

00:17:50.662 --> 00:17:53.562
I SAW THE FOOTAGE OF YOU
AT THE KENDO TOURNAMENT
THE OTHER DAY.

00:17:53.562 --> 00:17:54.762
IT WAS YOUR
FIRST YEAR COMPETING,

00:17:54.762 --> 00:17:56.995
AND YOU WON.
THAT’S AMAZING!

00:17:56.995 --> 00:17:59.262
NAH.
I JUST GOT LUCKY.

00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:01.662
I OWE IT ALL
TO CHI FOR COMING
TO SUPPORT ME

00:18:01.662 --> 00:18:03.595
AND BRINGING ME
THAT AWESOME LUNCH.

00:18:03.595 --> 00:18:06.362
SO A LUNCH FROM CHIYU
GIVES YOU SPECIAL POWERS,
DOES IT?

00:18:06.362 --> 00:18:07.762
YEAH. I GUESS.

00:18:07.762 --> 00:18:09.962
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THIS FOR YOURSELF, HARU.

00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:12.328
DIDN’T YOU ALSO GET
ONE OF HER LUNCHES YESTERDAY?

00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:14.262
( chuckles )

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:18.095
HM?

00:18:18.095 --> 00:18:19.628
HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

00:18:19.628 --> 00:18:20.862
HUH?

00:18:20.862 --> 00:18:23.595
Haru: <i>DID TAKU TELL HER</i>
<i>TO MAKE ME THAT LUNCH?</i>

00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:27.328
<i>BUT WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?</i>

00:18:27.328 --> 00:18:28.895
<i>WAIT!</i>

00:18:28.895 --> 00:18:31.695
<i>SHE DIDN’T TELL HIM</i>
<i>ABOUT ARAYA, DID SHE?</i>

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:33.995
<i>OF COURSE.</i>
<i>THAT’S WHY SHE MADE IT.</i>

00:18:33.995 --> 00:18:35.195
( gasps )

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:36.395
( grunts )

00:18:36.395 --> 00:18:37.895
HEY, HARU!

00:18:37.895 --> 00:18:39.228
GOTTA GO.

00:18:39.228 --> 00:18:41.462
I JUST REMEMBERED THERE’S
A SHOW I WANNA WATCH.

00:18:41.462 --> 00:18:43.328
SEE YOU LATER, GUYS.

00:18:43.328 --> 00:18:45.462
( both sigh )

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:52.328
<i>IT’S ALL OVER.</i>
<i>TAKU KNOWS!</i>

00:18:54.862 --> 00:18:58.562
( panting )

00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:09.562
<i>JUST WHEN I FINALLY</i>
<i>GET GOT RID OF ARAYA.</i>

00:19:09.562 --> 00:19:11.728
<i>WHO AM I KIDDING?</i>

00:19:11.728 --> 00:19:13.395
<i>IT’LL ALWAYS BE THIS WAY.</i>

00:19:13.395 --> 00:19:16.328
<i>THIS IS MY CRAPPY REALITY.</i>

00:19:19.895 --> 00:19:21.762
( laughing )

00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:26.628
<i>STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT.</i>

00:19:33.195 --> 00:19:35.062
<i>I CAN’T STAND IT ANYMORE!</i>

00:19:35.062 --> 00:19:36.595
<i>TAKE ME WITH YOU.</i>

00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:38.495
<i>THAT’S WHERE I WANT TO BE.</i>
<i>UP THERE!</i>

00:19:38.495 --> 00:19:41.028
<i>I WANT TO FLY</i>
<i>SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY!</i>

00:19:43.328 --> 00:19:45.562
( echoing voices )
SO, IS THAT YOUR WISH?

00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:57.061
Haru: <i>I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>I HAD A REALLY WEIRD DREAM.</i>

00:19:59.328 --> 00:20:02.328
<i>BUT WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?</i>

00:20:04.328 --> 00:20:06.195
MOM, I NEED
LUNCH MONEY.

00:20:06.195 --> 00:20:07.928
( sighs )

00:20:07.928 --> 00:20:10.728
HARUYUKI,
YOU’RE NOT ON THE NET.

00:20:10.728 --> 00:20:12.461
OH, RIGHT.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.595
Computer:
<i>CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL NET.</i>

00:20:16.928 --> 00:20:18.628
SEE YA LATER.

00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:46.528
DID I JUST...
ACCELERATE?

00:21:15.928 --> 00:21:18.595
AM I IN A VIRTUAL WORLD?

00:21:18.595 --> 00:21:22.728
BUT WHY?

00:21:29.928 --> 00:21:31.261
IS THAT...

00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:40.128
UH...

00:21:40.128 --> 00:21:42.361
IS THIS... THING ME?

00:21:44.228 --> 00:21:46.628
