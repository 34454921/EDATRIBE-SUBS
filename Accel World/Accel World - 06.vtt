00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.699
YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE ON BOTH OF YOU?

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.132
THAT’S
RIGHT.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.632
DEFEAT US,
AND YOU’RE
OFF THE HOOK.

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:35.032
AFTER THAT, YOU’RE FREE TO GO
JOIN THE BLACK KING OR ANY
OTHER LEGION, FOR THAT MATTER.

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:38.732

VANQUISH HAS TOLD YOU?

COME ON.
IS THAT ALL YOU’VE GOT?

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:58.432
IT’S STILL NOT TOO LATE
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

00:00:58.432 --> 00:01:01.699
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
TO AMEND YOUR WAYS,
WE’LL FORGIVE YOU.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:02.965
NO WAY!

00:01:02.965 --> 00:01:04.599
HE SHOULDN’T BE ABLE
TO MOVE RIGHT NOW.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.899
WHAT KIND OF PAIN
THRESHOLD
DOES HE HAVE?

00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:17.599
BLUE KNIGHT.
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.965
I DON’T EXPECT YOU TO
FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I’VE DONE.

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:23.899
BUT ALL I ASK IS FOR YOU
TO GIVE ME A LITTLE TIME.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.499
JUST TO TRAIN HIM!

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:27.032
Blue Knight:
COBAL, MARGA.

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:27.999
Both: SIR!

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.932
THROW HIM
INTO THE PORTAL.

00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:32.565
I WILL LET HIM GO
JUST THIS ONCE.

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:34.499
Both:
YES, SIR!

YOU WANT YOUR HAIR
UP LIKE THIS?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.806
I STILL THINK BRAIDS
WOULD SUIT YOU BETTER.

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:38.306
JUST DO IT.
I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT TODAY.

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:41.506
YEAH BUT, I JUST THINK
A PONYTAIL WILL GET
IN THE WAY A LOT.

00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:42.906

00:03:54.472 --> 00:03:57.272
SO. YOU WERE JUST
SAYING THAT YOU
NEEDED TO GET GOING?

00:03:57.272 --> 00:03:58.639
UH, YEP,
THAT’S RIGHT!

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.506
SEE YOU LATER,
HIME.

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:05.839
HAVE FUN.
BUT DON’T STAY TOO LONG!

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.172

YES, MUCH BETTER,
THANK YOU.

00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:21.906
BUT HAVING ANY FUN
IN A HOSPITAL IS
RATHER CHALLENGING.

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:25.539
NOT TO MENTION THE
DIFFICULTIES THAT COME WITH
TRYING TO FIND A DECENT MEAL.

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.672
WELL, THAT’S
THE WAY
IT IS.

00:04:27.672 --> 00:04:30.272
BUT YOU’VE GOTTA TAKE IT EASY
AND DO WHAT THEY SAY SO YOU
CAN FULLY RECOVER.

00:04:30.272 --> 00:04:34.272
YES. THAT’S TRUE...

00:04:34.272 --> 00:04:37.539
SO...IT’S ALMOST EVENING.

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.339
YEAH!
IT LOOKS
THAT WAY.

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:43.206
IT SURE IS
A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET.

00:04:44.372 --> 00:04:46.239
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MY HAIR?

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:50.106
THIS IS HOW YOU SAID
YOU LIKED IT YESTERDAY.
DID I MISUNDERSTAND?

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:51.706
AAH...NO, NO!

00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.606
I DO LIKE IT,
AND I DID NOTICE
IT FIRST THING.

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.272
I JUST...WASN’T SURE
HOW TO TELL YOU THAT.

00:04:57.272 --> 00:05:01.239
SEE, IF I SAID IT LOOKED
NICE, YOU MIGHT’VE THOUGHT
I WAS JUST SAYING IT TO SAY IT.

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:02.506
AND I DIDN’T
WANT THAT.

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:04.006
SO, DOES IT
SUIT ME OR NOT?!

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:06.739
YES, OF COURSE!
YOUR HAIR LOOKS
REALLY GOOD LIKE THAT!

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.206
YOU DON’T MEAN IT.
YOU’RE JUST BEING NICE.

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.506
NO, I’M BEING HONEST!
I SWEAR IT!

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:14.972
IT LOOKS...
REALLY GOOD.
I LIKE IT.

00:05:14.972 --> 00:05:16.506
I’M SORRY
I SUCK AT THIS.

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.006
OH, SAVE IT!

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.339
SO. DID YOU GO
AND SEE
KURASHIMA?

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.506
YES, TAKU AND I
BOTH WENT.

00:05:24.506 --> 00:05:26.306
WE TOLD HER
EVERYTHING.

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.972
WE TOLD HER ABOUT
ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:05:27.972 --> 00:05:32.372
AND THE BACKDOOR
PROGRAM TAKU INSTALLED.
AND ABOUT LYING TO HER.

00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:34.906
I SEE. SO, HOW DID
SHE TAKE ALL THAT?

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:36.539
SHE WAS REALLY,
REALLY MAD.

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.906
SHE STARTED GRABBING BOOKS
AND HURLING THEM AT US.

00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:43.106
THEN SHE GOT MORE UPSET AND
STARTED CRYING, WHICH PROGRESSED
INTO HER SLAPPING US BOTH.

00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:44.572
OH, I SEE.

00:05:44.572 --> 00:05:47.506
AND NOW, SHE WON’T
EVEN TALK TO US.
NOT A WORD.

00:05:47.506 --> 00:05:50.039
I CERTAINLY CAN’T
BLAME HER FOR
BEING ANGRY.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.039
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT,
PART OF THE FAULT HERE
LIES ENTIRELY WITH ME.

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.006
I REALLY SHOULD
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:57.906
NO. THAT’S OKAY.

00:05:57.906 --> 00:06:01.239
TAKU AND I ARE THE ONES
WHO SCREWED THIS ALL UP,
AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:02.772
TAKU FEELS
THE SAME WAY.

00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:06.072
HE SAID HE PLANS
TO ATONE FOR ALL
OF HIS MISTAKES.

00:06:06.072 --> 00:06:07.606
HE SAID THAT?

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:09.106
HE DID.

00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:10.739
I KNOW YOU’VE
SAID HE GOES TO
A DIFFERENT SCHOOL.

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:12.872
IT’S SOMEWHERE
IN SHINJUKU,
RIGHT?

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:16.639
YEAH. TAKU’S A SUPER
SMART GUY, SO HIS PARENTS
MADE HIM GO TO A SCHOOL

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.272
WHERE HE’D GET
A BETTER EDUCATION.

00:06:18.272 --> 00:06:20.172
AND HE’S REALLY GOOD
AT SPORTS TOO.

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.939
INTERESTING.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.472
THAT’S WHY I THINK
HE’LL BE A GOOD
ADDITION TO NEGA NEBULOUS.

00:06:24.472 --> 00:06:26.172
HE’LL BE A GREAT FIGHTER.

00:06:26.172 --> 00:06:29.006
HE AND I HAVE PLANS
TOMORROW TO GET TOGETHER
FOR A TAG-TEAM FIGHT.

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:33.506
HE SAID BY THE TIME YOU’RE
READY TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL,
HE’LL HELP ME GET TO LEVEL TWO.

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:36.039
HE MEANS A LOT
TO YOU.

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:37.439
I CAN SEE THAT.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.472
HMM?

00:06:38.472 --> 00:06:40.306
I’M KIND OF JEALOUS.
YOU’RE LUCKY.

00:06:40.306 --> 00:06:43.739
AFTER ALL THAT’S
HAPPENED, YOU STILL
FORGIVE EACH OTHER.

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:46.472
YOU’VE MOVED ON
FROM THE BETRAYAL
AND THE HATE.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:50.506
TAKU’S MY
BEST FRIEND.
THAT’S WHY.

00:06:54.506 --> 00:06:57.739
ARE YOU SURE YOU
REALLY WANT TO DO THIS?

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:59.406
YES.

00:07:01.572 --> 00:07:03.372
( girls chatting )

00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:05.072
I CAN’T BELIEVE THOSE TWO.

00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:07.539
IF HARU AND TAKU HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE THEY WANT TO TELL ME,

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.406
I WISH THEY’D JUST
SPIT IT OUT ALREADY.

00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:12.239
( groans )
THEY MAKE ME MAD!

00:07:13.106 --> 00:07:14.306
Taku: HARU,
TO YOUR RIGHT!

00:07:14.306 --> 00:07:16.639
YEAH,
I SEE HIM!

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.772
( grunts )

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.406
WHOA! THAT’S
THE AVATAR
WHO CAN FLY!

00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.806
THIS ISN’T THE TIME
TO BE STAR STRUCK!

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:31.672
( grunts )

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:34.339

5 SECONDS LEFT!

00:07:36.006 --> 00:07:37.372
Taku: FOUR.

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:38.706
THREE.

00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:39.706
TWO...

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:41.006
AND ONE!

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:44.806
Haru: YES!
THREE WINS IN A ROW!

00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:46.772
( gasps )

00:07:46.772 --> 00:07:47.939

00:07:51.172 --> 00:07:52.939

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:56.072
CAN’T WAIT TO TELL
EVERYONE I FOUGHT WITH
THE FLYING AVATAR. THANKS!

00:07:56.072 --> 00:07:59.372
BE SMART ABOUT
WHAT LEVEL-UP
BONUS YOU PICK.

00:07:59.372 --> 00:08:00.439
SEE YA!

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.506
THANKS FOR
A GOOD FIGHT.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:04.939
WAY TO GO.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.472
THANKS, TAKU.

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:08.839
I CAN’T WAIT TO TELL SENPAI
ABOUT THE GOOD NEWS.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:12.106
OR MAYBE LEVEL 2 IS
STILL NOT ENOUGH TO
REALLY IMPRESS HER.

00:08:12.106 --> 00:08:13.939
DON’T WORRY,
YOU’RE DOING FINE.

00:08:13.939 --> 00:08:17.806
I’LL BE HERE WATCHING
YOUR BACK, AT LEAST
UNTIL YOU REACH LEVEL 4.

00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:19.106
I OWE YOU THAT MUCH.

00:08:19.106 --> 00:08:20.672
WHAT?

00:08:20.672 --> 00:08:24.039
LOOK. I WANT TO
HELP YOU BECOME A
FIRST RATE BURST-LINKER.

00:08:24.039 --> 00:08:25.339
I HOPE THAT’S COOL.

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.972
I KNOW THAT WON’T MAKE UP
FOR EVERYTHING,

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:29.039
BUT IT’S
THE LEAST I CAN DO.

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:33.006
LISTEN, TAKU. I CAN’T STOP YOU
FROM FEELING RESPONSIBLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

00:08:33.006 --> 00:08:37.139
BUT...I’M THE REASON
WHY SENPAI GOT HURT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:38.639
IT WAS MY OWN
STUPID FAULT.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:42.406
NO. WHAT I DID
WAS UNFORGIVABLE.
I KNOW THAT NOW.

00:08:42.406 --> 00:08:45.406
YOU SAW IT YOURSELF,
HOW UPSET CHI WAS.

00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:47.972
MY CRIME IS WORSE.
WAY WORSE.

00:08:47.972 --> 00:08:50.039
I DON’T KNOW.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.239
HEY. I THINK
THAT’S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

00:08:52.239 --> 00:08:53.639
LET’S GO HOME.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:56.339
OKAY. GIMME A SEC.
LET ME FINISH THIS FIRST.

00:08:56.339 --> 00:08:59.939
FINISH WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON’T LEVEL UP YET.

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:02.072
( gasps )
NO, HARU!
STOP!

00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:03.372
HUH?

00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.672
THE BURST POINTS
I HAVE LEFT...

00:09:10.672 --> 00:09:12.006
ARE EIGHT?

00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:13.772
HARU!
BURST OUT NOW!

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.539
( panting )

00:09:19.472 --> 00:09:21.039
( gasping )

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:25.939
Taku: IT’S MY FAULT.
I’M SO SORRY.
I SHOULD’VE TOLD YOU.

00:09:25.939 --> 00:09:29.372
EVEN IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH POINTS TO GO
AND LEVEL UP YOUR AVATAR,

00:09:29.372 --> 00:09:31.239
YOU SHOULD WAIT
AND HOLD OFF A BIT.

00:09:31.239 --> 00:09:36.072
I’M A TERRIBLE TEACHER.
I’VE TOTALLY FAILED YOU.
I’M SORRY, HARU.

00:09:36.072 --> 00:09:38.506
NO, I’M
THE IDIOT HERE.

00:09:38.506 --> 00:09:40.339
THERE WAS A WARNING THAT
POPPED UP ON THE SCREEN

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:42.972
TELLING ME IT WOULD COST ME
300 POINTS TO LEVEL UP.

00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:45.839
I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
AND DONE THE MATH,
BUT I DIDN’T.

00:09:45.839 --> 00:09:47.839
I WAS WAY TOO EXCITED.

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:50.306
ALL RIGHT, FIRST.
LET’S LOOK AT
WHERE WE STAND.

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:53.739
ARE YOU SURE YOU’RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT? YOU ONLY HAVE
EIGHT POINTS LEFT?

00:09:53.739 --> 00:09:58.239
YEAH. IF I LOST A DUEL NOW TO
AN OPPONENT OF THE SAME LEVEL,
THEN I’D BE OUT FOR GOOD.

00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:01.039
ALL MY BURST POINTS
WOULD BE GONE FOREVER.

00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:04.772
YOU’RE RIGHT. IN WHICH
CASE, THAT ONLY LEAVES
US WITH ONE OPTION:

00:10:04.772 --> 00:10:07.439
CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL
SO I CAN GIVE YOU
HALF MY POINTS.

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:11.372
AFTER THAT, WE’LL STICK WITH
PLAYING TAG-TEAM MATCHES AGAINST
THOSE WE KNOW WE CAN BEAT,

00:10:11.372 --> 00:10:14.506
AT LEAST UNTIL
YOU REGAIN
YOUR POINTS.

00:10:14.506 --> 00:10:16.506
WAIT!
HOLD ON A SEC!

00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:18.672
WHAT’S THIS ABOUT
"GIVING" ME
YOUR BURST POINTS?

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:21.639
ARE YOU REALLY JUST GONNA
LET ME KEEP BEATING YOU
AND BEATING YOU,

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:23.372
AND YOU’RE NOT EVER
GONNA FIGHT BACK?

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.006
IT’S OUR ONLY CHOICE,
HARU.

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:27.772
LOOK, I’VE GOT
A TON OF POINTS
TO SPARE RIGHT NOW.

00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:31.106
BELIEVE ME, THIS
IS REALLY OUR
BEST OPTION. OKAY?

00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:33.706
NO WAY,
I WON’T DO THIS!

00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:36.939
I HATE THE IDEA OF
BEATING ON YOU AND
YOU NOT FIGHTING BACK.

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:39.206
THAT’S JUST...
NOT RIGHT.

00:10:39.206 --> 00:10:41.372
YEAH, BUT WHAT OTHER CHOICE
DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW?

00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:43.406
IF YOU END UP LOSING
ALL YOUR POINTS,

00:10:43.406 --> 00:10:46.239
THEN THAT MEANS YOU’LL END UP
LOSING BRAIN BURST FOREVER TOO.

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:49.139
AND THE SAME GOES FOR THIS
POWER THAT COMES ALONG WITH IT.

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:52.506
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...
I JUST...

00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:56.072
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY...
THAT YOU DON’T YOU TRUST ME?

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.172
HUH?
IT’S TRUE.

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:01.239
WITH YOUR POINTS SO LOW, IT’D BE
EASY FOR ME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THIS AND ATTACK YOU.

00:11:01.239 --> 00:11:04.906
I COULD PROBABLY TAKE YOUR
BURST POINTS DOWN TO ZERO
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

00:11:04.906 --> 00:11:07.706
NO, IT’S NOT
THAT. THAT’S NOT
WHAT I’M SAYING!

00:11:07.706 --> 00:11:09.406
IT JUST SEEMS WRONG.

00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:13.839
THE IDEA OF YOU AND ME
FIGHTING LIKE THIS. IT TAKES
THE HONOR AND FUN OUT OF IT.

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.972
HARU...?

00:11:15.972 --> 00:11:19.972
SENPAI USED PHYSICAL FULL
BURST TO PROTECT ME, AND
SHE’S IN THE HOSPITAL NOW.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:22.772
HER POINTS MUST BE
REALLY LOW.

00:11:22.772 --> 00:11:26.439
BUT THROUGH ALL OF THIS,
SHE HAS NEVER ASKED
ME FOR POINTS.

00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:30.439
AND IF I WERE TO OFFER
THEM TO HER, I’M SURE SHE’D
BE COMPLETELY OFFENDED.

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:32.472
SHE’S WAY BEYOND ME
ON EVERYTHING.

00:11:32.472 --> 00:11:34.539
HER LEVEL, STRENGTH,
EXPERIENCE.

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:37.506
YOU SEE, SHE’S THE KIND
OF BURST-LINKER I WANT TO BE.

00:11:37.506 --> 00:11:40.106
SHE SET AN EXAMPLE,
AND I WANT TO FOLLOW IT.

00:11:40.106 --> 00:11:41.972
( chuckles )

00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:44.639
I KNOW ONCE YOU’VE DECIDED
SOMETHING, THERE’S NO
CHANGING YOUR MIND.

00:11:44.639 --> 00:11:47.706
I GIVE UP.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:50.839
OKAY. I’LL TRY AND SEE
IF WE CAN COME UP
WITH ANY OTHER WAYS

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:52.506
TO REGAIN YOUR POINTS.

00:11:52.506 --> 00:11:55.639
BUT UNTIL WE’VE DONE THAT, YOU
CANNOT LOG ONTO THE GLOBAL NET.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:59.272
LOOK, TAKU. I’M SORRY.
I KNOW I’M BEING
KINDA SELFISH.

00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:02.606
( gasps )

00:12:02.606 --> 00:12:06.872
THOSE SLIPPERS. YOU
STILL KEPT THEM AROUND
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS?

00:12:06.872 --> 00:12:08.339
DIDN’T YOU?

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:13.006
NO. AFTER I LEFT
GRADE SCHOOL, MY
PARENTS TOSSED THEM.

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:14.239
OH...

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:15.806
( neuro-linker beeps )

00:12:15.806 --> 00:12:18.639
HUH?
OH, IT’S CHI.

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.972
SO, DID YOU
GET THEM?

00:12:21.972 --> 00:12:24.039
YEAH.
THESE ARE IT,
RIGHT?

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.272
( gasps )

00:12:29.406 --> 00:12:32.072
Taku: ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA EAT ALL THESE?

00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:33.072
HMM...

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:34.172
YOU DON’T HAVE
TO FINISH

00:12:34.172 --> 00:12:36.206
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THEM RIGHT NOW.

00:12:36.206 --> 00:12:39.039
IT’S BEEN MY DREAM TO EAT
EVERY FLAVOR OF ENJIYA
ICE CREAM IN ONE GO.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:42.006
I SAID BUYING THESE
FOR ME IS THE ONLY WAY
I WOULD FORGIVE YOU.

00:12:42.006 --> 00:12:44.539
AND THAT WON’T
HAPPEN TILL EVERY
LAST ONE IS GONE.

00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:46.572
YEAH, BUT...

00:12:46.572 --> 00:12:49.006
I JUST WANT THIS
TO BE OVER ALREADY.

00:12:49.006 --> 00:12:54.372
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU GUYS,
HARU’S GOT THIS HORRIBLY SAD,
PITIFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES.

00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:56.772
AND TAKU, ALL YOU DO
IS APOLOGIZE.

00:12:56.772 --> 00:13:00.372
WELL, THAT’S ’CAUSE...
YOU ALWAYS LOOK LIKE
YOU WANNA YELL AT US.

00:13:00.372 --> 00:13:01.639
YOU THINK
I LIKE THIS?

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:03.239
I DON’T WANNA BE
ANGRY ALL THE TIME.

00:13:03.239 --> 00:13:04.772
BUT IF I SAID:

00:13:04.772 --> 00:13:06.506
"IT’S ALL GOOD, GUYS.
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:13:06.506 --> 00:13:08.506
I’M NOT BOTHERED
BY THIS AT ALL."

00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:10.572
DON’T YOU THINK THAT
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT STRANGE?

00:13:10.572 --> 00:13:13.472
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU’RE RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A POINT.

00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:14.739
MMM...

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:16.972
SO ANYWAY,
WHAT’S YOUR PLAN NOW?

00:13:16.972 --> 00:13:19.839
ARE YOU STILL GONNA KEEP PLAYING
THIS BRAIN BURSTING THINGY?

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:21.639
UH...
WELL, YEAH.

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:23.539
AT LEAST,
THAT’S WHAT
I WAS HOPING.

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:27.072
( sighs ) BECAUSE
KUROYUKIHIME’S
PLAYING IT TOO.

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.939
IS THAT WHY YOU GUYS
ARE SO INTO THIS?

00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:31.539
LOOK, SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED
ME TO IT,

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:34.706
BUT THAT’S NOT THE
REASON WHY I WANNA
KEEP PLAYING IT.

00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:37.272
THE BRAIN BURST
PROGRAM IN
ITSELF ISN’T BAD.

00:13:37.272 --> 00:13:39.872
I JUST GOT
CARRIED AWAY AND
ABUSED ITS POWER.

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:43.106
HARU’S GOT THIS
SUPER COOL AVATAR,
IT CAN EVEN FLY.

00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:44.939
SO?
I STILL DON’T GET IT.

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:47.639
I MEAN, IT’S JUST ANOTHER
FIGHTING GAME. WHO CARES?

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:50.006
YEAH, BUT IT ISN’T
JUST A FIGHTING GAME.

00:13:50.006 --> 00:13:52.572
INSTEAD OF US
SITTING HERE TRYING
TO EXPLAIN IT TO YOU,

00:13:52.572 --> 00:13:55.639
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE EASIER IF WE
JUST SHOWED YOU.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:14:00.172
Taku: CHI, GRAB ONE OF
THOSE BOOKS ON YOUR DESK.
AND THEN THROW IT AT ME.

00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:01.772
WHAT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:05.239
THIS SHOULD SHOW
YOU WHAT BRAIN BURST
CAN DO. RIGHT?

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:07.339
HUH? OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU’RE DOING.

00:14:07.339 --> 00:14:08.606
I CAN’T
BELIEVE
YOU GUYS.

00:14:08.606 --> 00:14:10.706
YOU THINK
YOU’RE SO CLEVER
RIGHT NOW.

00:14:10.706 --> 00:14:12.272
( sighs )

00:14:12.272 --> 00:14:16.472
YOU ASKED FOR IT!
I’M THROWING THIS
AS HARD AS I CAN!

00:14:16.472 --> 00:14:17.406
BURST LINK!

00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:20.772
( gasping )

00:14:20.772 --> 00:14:23.106
Taku: IF YOU THINK
THAT WAS JUST
LUCK, TRY AGAIN.

00:14:23.106 --> 00:14:24.972
( growls )

00:14:24.972 --> 00:14:28.872
BURST LINK. BURST LINK.
BURST LINK.

00:14:28.872 --> 00:14:30.839
( panting )

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.339
DO YOU SEE?

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.506
EVEN SOMEONE LIKE
YOU CAN’T DENY
HOW COOL THAT WAS.

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.839
NOW YOU KNOW HOW
POWERFUL BRAIN BURST
REALLY IS--

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.839
( Chiyuri grunts )
Haru: AAH!

00:14:39.839 --> 00:14:41.306
THAT WAS
HARSH.

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:43.372
AH, SHUT UP,
HE ASKED
FOR IT!

00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:46.106
GREAT, NOW MY TUMMY’S
STARTING TO HURT.

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:48.372
Taku: BUT YOU STILL
HAVE A LOT LEFT.

00:14:48.372 --> 00:14:49.806
THEN HELP ME
FINISH.

00:14:49.806 --> 00:14:51.972
( giggles ) WE’RE ALL
GONNA EAT ’EM TOGETHER.

00:14:51.972 --> 00:14:53.706
IT’S YOUR PUNISHMENT!

00:14:53.706 --> 00:14:55.239
YOU SERIOUS?

00:14:55.239 --> 00:14:59.006
OW...
COME ON.
LET’S DIG IN.

00:14:59.006 --> 00:15:01.272
YOU SURE?

00:15:01.272 --> 00:15:04.006
NOW HURRY UP,
BEFORE THEY ALL MELT.

00:15:04.006 --> 00:15:07.872
OKAY, I THINK THAT
I’M GONNA GO FOR THE
SPECIAL PUDDING FLAVOR.

00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:08.906
AND YOU, TAKU?

00:15:08.906 --> 00:15:11.539
LET’S SEE...
PINE BOMBER.

00:15:11.539 --> 00:15:15.772
VERY BERRY CHERRY.
DANGEROUS BANANA.
CHOCO BOUNCER.

00:15:15.772 --> 00:15:16.806
( gasps )

00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:19.172
BOUNCER.

00:15:19.172 --> 00:15:21.239
HMM?
HEY, WHAT’S WRONG?

00:15:21.239 --> 00:15:23.439
HARU’S STILL
AT LEVEL 2.

00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:25.139
HUH?

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:26.906
A BOUNCER,
OF COURSE!

00:15:26.906 --> 00:15:29.439
HEY! WE COULD GET
OURSELVES A BOUNCER.

00:15:29.439 --> 00:15:31.606
A WHAT?

00:15:38.693 --> 00:15:40.193
Haru: Y-YOUR HAIR
LOOKS NICE TODAY.
HUH?

00:15:40.193 --> 00:15:42.327
OH. I JUST HAVE IT
LIKE THIS WHILE I’M EATING.

00:15:42.327 --> 00:15:44.427
IT WAS GETTING
IN THE WAY OTHERWISE.

00:15:44.427 --> 00:15:45.893
UH...OH...

00:15:45.893 --> 00:15:48.127
BY THE WAY. GOOD NEWS.
I GOT A CLEAN
BILL OF HEALTH.

00:15:48.127 --> 00:15:49.927
THEY SAID
I COULD GO HOME
ON WEDNESDAY.

00:15:49.927 --> 00:15:51.560
REALLY?
THAT’S GREAT!

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.493
YES, NO MORE
PRISON FOOD FOR ME.

00:15:54.493 --> 00:15:55.827
( laughs )

00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:58.793
SO THEN, HOW ARE YOUR
TAG-TEAM MATCHES PROGRESSING?

00:15:58.793 --> 00:16:01.427
DO YOU THINK YOU’LL BE ABLE
TO REACH LEVEL 2 BY WEDNESDAY?

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:04.360
YEAH. UM, I’M STILL
WORKING ON IT.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.493
<i>ACTUALLY, I’M</i>
<i>ALREADY AT THAT LEVEL.</i>

00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:08.893
<i>BUT THE LAST THING I WANT IS</i>
<i>HER TO FIND OUT I SCREWED UP.</i>

00:16:08.893 --> 00:16:13.127
WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
HARUYUKI...I’D LIKE FOR US
TO HAVE OUR OWN TERRITORY.

00:16:13.127 --> 00:16:17.060
I’M THINKING THAT NEGA NEBULOUS
COULD CLAIM THE UNOCCUPIED
SUGINAMI DISTRICT.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.260
BUT WE REALLY SHOULDN’T
MAKE THAT CLAIM UNTIL
YOU REACH LEVEL 2.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.793
WELL, IT COULD
STILL HAPPEN.

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:23.927
I’M SUPPOSED TO
HAVE ANOTHER DUEL
LATER TODAY.

00:16:23.927 --> 00:16:26.760
OH, REALLY?
A TAG-TEAM MATCH
WITH TAKUMU?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.727
UM, YEAH...
WITH HIM.

00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:30.927
I SEE...

00:16:30.927 --> 00:16:32.860
WAIT, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.560
NOT AT ALL, GOOD LUCK.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.093
JUST...DON’T BE IN
TOO BIG OF A RUSH, OKAY?

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:41.193
THE PROBLEM WITH LEVELING UP TOO
QUICKLY IS THAT IT PUTS YOU IN A
BAD POSITION WITH YOUR POINTS.

00:16:41.193 --> 00:16:44.993
( screams )
BUT YOU WOULDN’T MAKE
SUCH A MISTAKE, I’M SURE.

00:16:44.993 --> 00:16:47.127
YEAH, BUT...
I’LL BE CAREFUL.

00:16:47.127 --> 00:16:49.293
<i>PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR</i>
<i>BEING SUCH AN IDIOT.</i>

00:16:49.293 --> 00:16:51.227
<i>I CAN’T BELIEVE</i>
<i>HOW STUPID I AM.</i>

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.460
Haru:
I CAN TAKE
IT FROM HERE.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.693
WHOEVER THIS IS
MIGHT BE WATCHING
US ALREADY.

00:16:57.693 --> 00:17:01.493
YEAH, OKAY. IF
ANYTHING HAPPENS THOUGH,
CONTACT ME RIGHT AWAY.

00:17:01.493 --> 00:17:03.360
( grunts )

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.627
Taku: THIS GUY IS THE ONLY
PLAYER IN BRAIN BURST WHO
DOES THIS BOUNCER THING.

00:17:06.627 --> 00:17:08.527
HE’S SORT OF
LIKE A BODYGUARD.

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:09.660
Haru:
A BODYGUARD?

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.193
YEAH. I’VE NEVER
REALLY MET HIM
IN PERSON.

00:17:12.193 --> 00:17:14.493
BUT I’VE WATCHED HIM
FIGHT SEVERAL TIMES.

00:17:14.493 --> 00:17:17.060
THE NAME
OF HIS AVATAR
IS AQUA CURRENT.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.160
THE BURST LINKERS HE HELPS
ARE THE ONES WHOSE POINTS
ARE DANGEROUSLY LOW.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.927
HE PARTNERS UP
WITH THEM
IN TAG MATCHES

00:17:22.927 --> 00:17:25.060
UNTIL THEIR POINTS
ARE BACK TO
A SAFE NUMBER.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.027
HE CAN DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

00:17:27.027 --> 00:17:29.193
SO HE MUST BE A REALLY
HIGH-LEVEL PLAYER.

00:17:29.193 --> 00:17:32.660
NOT REALLY. HE’S KNOWN
AS "THE ONE," ’CAUSE
HE’S STILL AT LEVEL 1.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.993
A BODYGUARD
WHO’S STILL
AT LEVEL 1?

00:17:34.993 --> 00:17:37.160
YEAH, I KNOW.
BIZARRE, RIGHT?

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.893
I’M NOT REALLY SURE
HOW HE DOES IT.

00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:42.427
HE HAS RULES AND
CONDITIONS YOU MUST MEET
TOO IF YOU WANT TO HIRE HIM.

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:45.460
THE FIRST RULE IS THAT
YOU HAVE TO BE
LEVEL 2 OR LOWER.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.727
OTHERWISE, HE WON’T
EVEN BOTHER WITH YOU.

00:17:47.727 --> 00:17:51.093
THE NEXT IS THAT YOU
MUST REVEAL YOUR TRUE
IDENTITY TO HIM.

00:17:51.093 --> 00:17:54.760
THAT’S BASICALLY YOUR
PAYMENT. LEVERAGE HE
CAN KEEP ON YOU.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.127
Haru:
GOT IT.

00:17:56.127 --> 00:17:57.927
Computer voice:
<i>MESSAGE FROM KUROYUKIHIME.</i>

00:17:57.927 --> 00:18:01.727
Taku: I TRIED TO GIVE
HIM MY IDENTITY, BUT HE
INSISTED ON HAVING YOURS.

00:18:01.727 --> 00:18:05.360
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO FIND THIS GUY?

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.560
Taku: YOU WON’T KNOW
UNTIL YOU GET TO
THE MEETING PLACE.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.493
APPARENTLY, IT’LL ALL BE
REVEALED THERE.

00:18:09.493 --> 00:18:11.427
Haru:
AND I HAVE
TO BE ALONE?

00:18:11.427 --> 00:18:13.860
I MEAN, WE DON’T
EVEN KNOW FOR SURE
IF THIS IS SAFE.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.993
OR IF HE’S
EVEN LEGIT.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.427
DO YOU WANT ME TO
WATCH OUT FOR YOU?

00:18:16.427 --> 00:18:17.727
NO, DON’T
DO THAT.

00:18:17.727 --> 00:18:19.893
IF HE SPOTS YOU,
HE MAY DISAPPEAR
FOR GOOD.

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:22.527
AND I DON’T WANT
HIM TO THINK I’M
HIDING SOMETHING.

00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:23.960
( gasps )

00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:33.160
( beeping )

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.893
Waitress:
HERE’S YOUR
ORDER, SIR.

00:18:34.893 --> 00:18:37.060
UM, WHOSE BAG
IS THIS?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.960
I DON’T KNOW. I ASSUMED
IT BELONGED TO WHOEVER
YOU’RE WAITING FOR.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.493
Male computer voice:
<i>ENTER YOUR NAME.</i>

00:18:56.027 --> 00:19:00.593
Haru: NO, WAIT...

00:19:00.593 --> 00:19:01.593
( camera clicks )

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:03.560
AAH!
UH...UH...

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.793
SO THAT’S HOW
HE DOES IT.

00:19:07.793 --> 00:19:11.893
Male computer voice: <i>PAYMENT</i>
<i>RECEIVED. THE MISSION WILL</i>
<i>COMMENCE AT 13:40.</i>

00:19:11.893 --> 00:19:13.627
<i>STAY IN POSITION.</i>

00:19:13.627 --> 00:19:14.693
Haru: <i>13:40...?</i>

00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:18.688
<i>SO, WHAT’S THIS MEAN?</i>

00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:21.888
<i>I’M SUPPOSED TO WAIT</i>
<i>10 MINUTES TO BURST LINK?</i>

00:19:21.888 --> 00:19:23.822
<i>JUST WHERE EXACTLY</i>
<i>IS HE WATCHING FROM?</i>

00:19:27.055 --> 00:19:30.688
<i>OH, WELL. NO POINT IN</i>
<i>WORRYING ABOUT THAT NOW.</i>

00:19:30.688 --> 00:19:33.588
<i>GUESS I HAVE TIME TO TAKE</i>
<i>A QUICK BATHROOM BREAK.</i>

00:19:36.388 --> 00:19:40.088
I DON’T KNOW WHY PLACES
LIKE THIS MAKE WANT TO
GO PEE, BUT THEY DO.

00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:42.455
( grunting, screaming )

00:19:42.455 --> 00:19:45.588
( loud thud )

00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:48.322
( straining, gasping )

00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:51.188
HUH?

00:19:51.188 --> 00:19:54.455
( screaming )

00:19:54.455 --> 00:19:56.322
I’M SORRY!
I’M SO SORRY!

00:19:56.322 --> 00:19:59.488

00:20:01.922 --> 00:20:06.022
SORRY,

AAH!

00:20:06.022 --> 00:20:08.022
HUH?

UM...

00:20:09.322 --> 00:20:11.222
Y-YEAH?

PLEASE GIVE THAT
BACK TO ME.

00:20:14.888 --> 00:20:15.922
SO, UM...

00:20:15.922 --> 00:20:17.255
YES?

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:19.988
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT YOU’RE
AQUA CURRENT?

00:20:24.055 --> 00:20:24.988
( grunts )

00:20:29.155 --> 00:20:31.088
( sighs )

00:20:31.088 --> 00:20:32.322
I DON’T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:20:32.322 --> 00:20:35.722
THAT BAG DOESN’T
BELONG TO ME.

00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:45.488
SORRY, I LIED.

00:20:45.488 --> 00:20:49.022
( groaning )
SO TIRED.

00:20:49.022 --> 00:20:52.188
Student 1: WHAT?!

00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:53.888
HMM?
Student 2: YEAH.

00:20:53.888 --> 00:20:55.755
NOW THAT HE’S NOT
COMPETING, THE GUYS
ON OUR TEAM

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:57.955
THINK THEY HAVE A CHANCE
AT WINNING THIS
YEAR’S TOURNAMENT.

00:20:57.955 --> 00:20:59.255
Student 1:

00:20:59.255 --> 00:21:01.855

00:21:01.855 --> 00:21:02.988

<i>BODYGUARD WOULD BE A GUY.</i>

00:21:21.122 --> 00:21:22.222

00:21:22.222 --> 00:21:25.722
NO!
NOT AT ALL!

00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:27.622
<i>OH, NO, I THINK</i>
<i>I MADE HER MAD.</i>

00:21:27.622 --> 00:21:29.455
<i>I HOPE THIS DOESN’T</i>
<i>SCREW THINGS UP.</i>

00:21:29.455 --> 00:21:32.222
<i>I STILL NEED HER</i>
<i>TO ACCEPT MY REQUEST.</i>

HUH...

00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:36.922
UH...SORRY, I DIDN’T
MEAN TO DO THAT.

00:21:36.922 --> 00:21:38.455
WAIT!
HOLD ON A SEC!

00:21:38.455 --> 00:21:39.822

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:46.955
Woman 2: THAT GIRL
HAS NO SHAME.

00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:49.722
LOOK, CABLE-LINKING
IS PRETTY MUCH JUST
A COUPLES’ THING.

00:21:49.722 --> 00:21:51.188
AND YOU AND ME,
WE JUST MET.

00:21:52.388 --> 00:21:53.622
I’M JUST AFRAID IF WE
DO THIS HERE,

00:21:53.622 --> 00:21:55.222
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
GET THE WRONG IDEA.

00:21:55.222 --> 00:21:57.855
I CAN’T HAVE SOMEONE
OVERHEAR THIS CONVERSATION.
