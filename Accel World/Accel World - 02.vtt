WEBVTT

00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:11.063
( banging sounds )

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:11.922
DID I JUST...

00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:13.589
ACCELERATE?

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:21.856
Haru:
( gasps )

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.722
AM I IN A VIRTUAL WORLD?

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:33.522
( gasps )

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:36.356
HOLD ON!
IS THIS ME?

00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:37.989
THIS IS SO...

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:40.389
Man in Black:
WHAT’S WITH THIS GUY?

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:41.956
SEEMS LIKE HE’S SCARED.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:44.022
Green Girl: THE NAME ISN’T
RINGING A BELL EITHER.

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:45.289
YOU THINK HE’S A NEWBIE?

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.289
I DUNNO.
HE’S A METAL-COLORED TYPE,

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.822
SO HE SHOULD
BE STRONG.

00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:52.256
THOSE AREN’T NPCS.
THEY SEEM LIKE REAL PEOPLE.

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:53.356
( metallic noise )

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.056
ARE THEY BURST LINKERS?

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:56.589
OH!

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.689
I HAVEN’T FOUGHT IN THE WORLD’S
END STAGE IN AWHILE.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:03.389
LUCKY ME!

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:06.322
AND EVEN BETTER,
MY OPPONENT IS A NEWBIE.

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:09.289
NOW I’M MEGA LUCKY!

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.989
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:14.956
YOU ARE GIGA UNLUCKY!

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:16.856
( laughing )

00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:20.889
OH NO. IS THIS REALLY
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.789
I THINK I’M INSIDE OF A...

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:27.722
( gasps )

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:30.922
( gasps )

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.256
I AM.

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:38.289
I DON’T STAND A CHANCE!

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.422
Hime: ( giggles )
YOU GOT HIT RIGHT AWAY, HUH?

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:44.322
IT’S NOT FUNNY!

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:46.056
I REALLY THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA DIE.

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.422
THAT’S WHAT YOU
GET FOR BREAKING
YOUR PROMISE TO ME.

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:53.122
I KNOW. WHEN I LOGGED
ONTO THE GLOBAL NET
I JUST WASN’T THINKING.

00:01:53.122 --> 00:01:56.956
WELL, AT LEAST IT WILL
MAKE EXPLAINING THINGS
TO YOU A LITTLE EASIER.

00:01:56.956 --> 00:01:59.322
Hime: I’M ASSUMING
YOU’VE FIGURED IT OUT.

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:01.656
WHAT BRAIN BURST ACTUALLY IS?

00:02:01.656 --> 00:02:04.322
YEAH. IT’S BASICALLY
JUST A FIGHTING GAME.

00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:07.522
BUT ALL OF THE BATTLES
ARE STAGED IN REALITY.

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:09.456
EXACTLY.
( sighs )

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:11.822
THIS IS CRAZY!

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:14.889
♪
( singing in Japanese )

00:03:44.664 --> 00:03:47.445
SPEEDING UP BRAINWAVES, HACKING
INTO THE SECURITY CAMERAS...

00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:48.811
ALL FOR SOME FIGHTING GAME?

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.145
IT’S RIDICULOUS!

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:54.011
HMM, YOU’RE MISSING
THE POINT HERE.

00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:56.478
WE BURST LINKERS AREN’T
ACCELERATING JUST SO

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.311
WE CAN FIGHT INSIDE A GAME.

00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:01.845
WE FIGHT SO WE CAN CONTINUE
TO ACCELERATE.

00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:03.778
I’M NOT FOLLOWING.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:07.078
ACCELERATE,
AND I’LL SHOW YOU.

00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:08.978
OKAY.

00:04:08.978 --> 00:04:10.678
Both:
<i>BURST LINK.</i>

00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:15.811
( grunting )

00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.811
( gasps )

00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:18.611
HMM, SOMETHING WRONG?

00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:22.345
NO! NOTHING!
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.011
IF YOU LOOK ON THE LEFT SIDE
OF YOUR SCREEN

00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.311
YOU’LL SEE A NEW DESKTOP ICON
AMONGST THE OTHERS.

00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:30.378
Hime: THAT GIVES YOU THE MENU
FOR BRAIN BURST--

00:04:30.378 --> 00:04:32.445
AS YOU KNOW,
A FIGHTING GAME.

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:34.678
NOW CLICK ON
THE "MATCHMAKING LIST."

00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:36.145
( sighs )

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:37.945
RIGHT NOW IT SHOULD ONLY
HAVE OUR NAMES,

00:04:37.945 --> 00:04:40.411
SINCE YOU AND I ARE
THE ONLY BURST LINKERS

00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:42.578
CURRENTLY LOGGED
INTO THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.

00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:45.345
OKAY, MISS BLACK LOTUS.

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:47.011
Hime: ALL RIGHT,
NOW CLICK ON MY NAME

00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:48.711
AND CHALLENGE ME TO A DUEL.

00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:49.878
WHAT?!

00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:51.878
WE’RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING
TO FIGHT EACH OTHER.

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.311
WE’LL JUST RUN THE CLOCK DOWN
AND CALL IT A DRAW.

00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.478
GOT IT?
( sighs )

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:32.345
OH, THIS IS
THE TWILIGHT STAGE.

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:34.611
IT’S ACTUALLY
QUITE RARE.

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:36.878
SO. THIS IS
YOUR DUEL AVATAR.

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.678
SILVER CROW?
THAT’S A GOOD NAME.

00:05:39.678 --> 00:05:42.245
I LIKE THE COLOR,
TOO.

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:45.211
IT’S A GOOD LOOK.
I APPROVE.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.745
I DON’T KNOW.
I THINK IT’S KINDA WIMPY.

00:05:47.745 --> 00:05:49.811
CAN IT BE REDESIGNED?

00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:52.778
ACTUALLY, WHO ORIGINALLY CAME UP
WITH THIS NAME AND LOOK?

00:05:52.778 --> 00:05:54.078
THAT WAS DONE BY YOU.

00:05:54.078 --> 00:05:55.878
ME?

00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:58.378
THINK BACK. DO YOU
RECALL HAVING A STRANGE
DREAM LAST NIGHT?

00:05:58.378 --> 00:06:01.511
YEAH. THE DETAILS
ARE KINDA FUZZY.

00:06:01.511 --> 00:06:04.078
BUT I DO REMEMBER IT
BEING SCARY.

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:05.878
THAT WAS THE BRAIN BURST
PROGRAM SCANNING

00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:07.611
YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS
WHILE YOU SLEPT.

00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.078
IT COMPILED THE DATA FROM
ALL YOUR HOPES AND FEARS.

00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:12.845
AND THEN IT USED THAT DATA
AS A MOLD FOR YOUR AVATAR.

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.445
SO YOU’RE SAYING
THIS WAS ALL MY IDEA?

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:17.945
I WANTED THIS SKINNY
AND SHINY LOOK?

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:19.245
I’M NOT SO SURE.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.811
IT DOESN’T MAKE
YOUR IDEAL IMAGE.

00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:24.545
IT’S MORE A REFLECTION
OF ALL YOUR INSECURITIES.

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:26.145
( gasps )

00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:29.878
WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
YOUR AVATAR WAS CREATED
BY BRAIN BURST TOO, RIGHT?

00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:32.611
NO. ACTUALLY, THIS IS
AN AVATAR THAT I MADE.

00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:35.445
IT’S A LONG STORY,
BUT I HAD TO SEAL AWAY

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:37.211
MY ORIGINAL DUEL AVATAR.

00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:38.845
SEAL IT AWAY?

00:06:38.845 --> 00:06:41.945
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WAS RATHER UGLY.

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:44.145
A TRULY HIDEOUS THING.

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:46.378
BUT THAT’S ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:48.611
THIS MORNING, YOU WERE
ATTACKED AND THEN

00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:50.111
BEATEN BY ANOTHER
BURST LINKER.

00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:52.511
THINK BACK. DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW THE RESULT SCREEN

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.078
READ WHEN
THE FIGHT ENDED?

00:06:54.078 --> 00:06:57.211
YEAH, IT HAD MY NAME
AND LEVEL 1.

00:06:57.211 --> 00:07:01.111
AND ALSO SOMETHING
CALLED BURST POINTS.

00:07:01.111 --> 00:07:04.178
THEY’D GONE
FROM 99 TO 89.

00:07:04.178 --> 00:07:05.678
THE BURST POINTS.

00:07:05.678 --> 00:07:08.078
THAT’S IT.
THAT’S WHY WE DO THIS.

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:11.411
WHY WE SET FOOT IN THIS RUTHLESS
BATTLEFIELD TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:14.311
THE BURST POINTS
REPRESENT HOW MANY TIMES

00:07:14.311 --> 00:07:16.245
YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO ACCELERATE.

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.945
EACH ACCELERATION
IS EQUAL TO ONE POINT.

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:22.011
SO THEN HOW DO YOU GO
ABOUT GETTING MORE POINTS?

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.211
THERE’S ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET MORE POINTS.
BY WINNING FIGHTS.

00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:27.911
IF YOUR OPPONENT IS
ON THE SAME LEVEL,

00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:30.478
ANY FIGHT YOU WIN OR LOSE
IS TEN POINTS.

00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:33.345
THE POWER FROM ACCELERATION
IS UNPARALLELED.

00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:35.878
WITH IT YOU CAN EASILY
WIN FIGHTS, ACE TESTS ON

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:39.278
ANY GIVEN SUBJECT, BECOME
A FANTASTICALLY RICH GAMBLER,

00:07:39.278 --> 00:07:40.811
OR A CHAMPION ATHLETE.

00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:42.811
ONCE YOU’VE TASTED
THE ADVANTAGE IT GIVES YOU,

00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:45.245
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT
TO KEEP FIGHTING SO YOU CAN

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:47.011
HOLD ON TO THAT POWER FOREVER.

00:07:47.011 --> 00:07:48.745
OKAY, WAIT A SEC.

00:07:48.745 --> 00:07:51.378
IF YOU LOSE POINTS EVERY
TIME YOU ACCELERATE OR
GET BEATEN IN A FIGHT,

00:07:51.378 --> 00:07:54.878
THAT MEANS A WEAK PLAYER
COULD EVENTUALLY END UP
WITH NO POINTS AT ALL.

00:07:54.878 --> 00:07:56.945
WHAT HAPPENS TO ’EM THEN?

00:07:56.945 --> 00:07:59.345
THAT IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.678
THEY LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOR LIFE.

00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:03.145
( gasping )

00:08:03.145 --> 00:08:05.511
IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY
UNINSTALL ITSELF
FROM THE USER

00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.911
AND THE USER CAN
NEVER LOAD IT AGAIN.

00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:10.411
EVEN CHANGING
NEURO-LINKERS
WON’T WORK BECAUSE

00:08:10.411 --> 00:08:12.178
YOU’RE IDENTIFIED
BY YOUR OWN BRAIN WAVE.

00:08:12.178 --> 00:08:13.845
ONCE YOU’VE LOST
ALL YOUR POINTS,

00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:17.045
YOU CAN NEVER
ACCELERATE AGAIN.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:20.178
I’D LOSE BRAIN BURST
FOREVER?

00:08:20.178 --> 00:08:23.178
THAT MEANS I’D LOSE
SENPAI, TOO.

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:24.878
HARUYUKI.

00:08:24.878 --> 00:08:27.278
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO YOUR OLD LIFE,

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.178
NOW’S THE TIME TO DO IT.

00:08:29.178 --> 00:08:32.245
THOSE BULLIES ARE GONE.
THEY WON’T BE COMING BACK.

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:34.445
I PROMISE.

00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:36.345
THE CHOICE IS ALL YOURS.

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:43.078
I DON’T THINK YOU REALIZE
JUST HOW MUCH I OWE YOU.

00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:45.545
I HAVE TO RETURN THE FAVOR.
HUH?

00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:49.145
WHAT YOU DID WAS RESCUE ME
FROM THAT LIVING HELL.

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:52.845
AND I GET THIS FEELING
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
SOMETHING IN RETURN.

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:55.311
THAT’S THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

00:08:55.311 --> 00:08:57.411
I MEAN, WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
HAVE SINGLED ME OUT

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:59.078
AND GONE TO ALL
THIS TROUBLE?

00:08:59.078 --> 00:09:02.845
I CAN SEE WHY YOU
WOULD THINK THAT.
LOOK...

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:05.678
I KNOW I’M NOT
THE KINDA GUY
A GIRL LIKE YOU

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.578
IS USUALLY GONNA
HANG OUT WITH.

00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:11.811
I’M JUST A FAT,
UGLY CRYBABY.

00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:15.278
I’M A REAL LOSER.
I’M WORTHLESS.

00:09:15.278 --> 00:09:17.378
BUT YOU CHOSE ME
AND EVEN CABLE

00:09:17.378 --> 00:09:19.511
LINKED WITH ME
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:23.278
AND LOOK, I’M NOT DELUSIONAL,
I’M NOT GONNA KID MYSELF.

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:26.411
I KNOW THE ONLY REASON
YOU DID IT IS BECAUSE
I’M GOOD AT GAMES.

00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:29.578
BUT IF I CAN,
I WANNA BE MORE THAN THAT.

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:32.745
AND, BESIDES, THE TRUTH IS,
WHAT I’M TRYING TO SAY IS

00:09:32.745 --> 00:09:36.011
I JUST--I JUST DON’T EVER
WANNA LET YOU DOWN.

00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.511
THE CHARITY YOU SHOWED ME...
I WANNA REPAY THAT.

00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.378
SO, I’LL FIGHT.
I’LL DO IT!

00:09:42.378 --> 00:09:45.445
I’LL BECOME A BURST LINKER!

00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:48.978
Hime: THANK YOU.
BUT DO NOT CALL IT CHARITY.

00:09:48.978 --> 00:09:52.578
I AM NOTHING MORE THAN AN
IGNORANT LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL.

00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:56.945
I’M A LIVING, BREATHING PERSON
NOT THAT UNLIKE YOURSELF.

00:09:56.945 --> 00:10:00.345
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO’S KEEPING
YOUR DISTANCE FROM ME.

00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:03.111
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT THIS GAP BETWEEN US

00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.878
IS SO GREAT IT CAN
NEVER BE CLOSED?

00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:09.445
I DO.

00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:12.211
YOU CAN’T BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
WHERE I’M COMING FROM.

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.411
HOW SCARY
IT IS FOR ME.

00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:16.211
JUST TO SIMPLY BE NOTICED
AND ACKNOWLEDGED

00:10:16.211 --> 00:10:19.011
BY SOMEONE
AS PERFECT AS YOU.

00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.911
YOU HAVE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
AND MADE ME HAPPY.

00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:25.711
YOU’RE WHAT SAVED ME
FROM A HORRIBLE HELL.

00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.011
I COULDN’T ASK
FOR ANYTHING MORE.

00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:29.478
I SEE.

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:32.845
WELL, I’M GLAD TO HEAR
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:36.878
TRUTH BE TOLD, I HAVE GOTTEN
MYSELF INTO A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE.

00:10:36.878 --> 00:10:40.211
AND I BELIEVE YOU’RE
THE PERSON WHO CAN HELP ME.

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:42.345
I’LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN.
I PROMISE.

00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:44.245
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU NEED.

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:46.611
VERY GOOD.

00:10:46.611 --> 00:10:50.345
BUT FIRST YOU MUST LEARN
HOW TO FIGHT.

00:10:57.812 --> 00:10:59.952
I DON’T KNOW,
ARE YOU SURE I CAN DO THIS?

00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:02.286
YES, I HAVE NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:05.019
BUT FIRST YOU
NEED TO SIT UP
AND EAT YOUR LUNCH.

00:11:05.019 --> 00:11:06.419
IT’S GETTING COLD NOW.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.319
( groaning )

00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:09.752
Megumi:
HIME.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.286
I’M SORRY FOR
INTRUDING LIKE THIS,

00:11:11.286 --> 00:11:13.019
BUT I’D LIKE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.986
BECAUSE WE’RE ALL
DYING TO KNOW.

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:16.519
IT’S THE SECOND TIME
HE’S HERE.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.286
SO, I WAS JUST CURIOUS
AS TO WHAT EXACTLY

00:11:19.286 --> 00:11:21.086
IS GOING ON
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

00:11:21.086 --> 00:11:24.952
WELL, THE TRUTH IS I INVITED HIM
HERE SO I COULD ASK HIM OUT.

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:27.152
BUT HE REJECTED ME.

00:11:28.452 --> 00:11:29.652
( screaming )

00:11:29.652 --> 00:11:32.019
( gasping )

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:33.619
Students:
WHAT?

00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:35.319
WHAT THE HECK
WERE YOU THINKING?

00:11:35.319 --> 00:11:37.552
I’M JUST GONNA GET
PICKED ON ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:11:37.552 --> 00:11:39.752
THANKS A LOT--
FOR NOTHING!

00:11:39.752 --> 00:11:42.086
ALL THAT I DID WAS
SIMPLY TELL THE TRUTH.

00:11:42.086 --> 00:11:45.286
AND FROM MY VIEW,
YOU SEEMED TO ENJOY IT.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.086
( screaming )

00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:50.219
WHEN DID YOU TAKE
THAT SCREEN SHOT?!
TRASH IT!

00:11:50.219 --> 00:11:52.619
YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY
BE PROUD OF THIS.

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:54.852
I HAVE REJECTED
MANY BOYS BEFORE.

00:11:54.852 --> 00:11:56.752
BUT YOU’RE THE FIRST
TO REJECT ME.

00:11:56.752 --> 00:11:59.119
OKAY, MOVING ON.
UH...

00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:00.786
Hime: THE MOMENT
YOU LEAVE THE SCHOOL,

00:12:00.786 --> 00:12:03.019
YOU’LL BE CONNECTED
TO THE GLOBAL NET.

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:05.652
ACCELERATE BEFORE
ANYONE ATTACKS YOU.

00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:07.019
THEN,

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:09.319
FIND ASH ROLLER
AND CHALLENGE HIM.
GOT IT.

00:12:12.452 --> 00:12:15.752
THIS WILL BE YOUR OFFICIAL
DEBUT, SILVER CROW.

00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:17.886
GOOD LUCK.

00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:19.119
( grunting )

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:37.586
Hime: <i>FIRST,</i>
<i>YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO FIGHT.</i>

00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:40.152
FIND YOUR NAME LISTED
BELOW THE ENERGY GAUGE

00:12:40.152 --> 00:12:42.286
AND THEN
CLICK ON IT.
OKAY.

00:12:42.286 --> 00:12:45.586
THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND OUT WHAT
ABILITIES YOUR DUEL AVATAR HAS.

00:12:45.586 --> 00:12:49.886
THIS SAYS I’VE ONLY GOT
A NORMAL PUNCH AND KICK.

00:12:49.886 --> 00:12:53.019
AND FOR MY SPECIAL MOVE,
IT’S A HEAD BUTT.

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:54.586
DON’T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:56.486
I KNOW THOSE SKILLS SEEM
MEDIOCRE, BUT YOU’LL HAVE

00:12:56.486 --> 00:12:58.819
SOMETHING SPECIAL
TO MAKE UP FOR IT,
I’M SURE.

00:12:58.819 --> 00:13:02.919
YEAH, BUT...
THE KEY HERE IS YOUR HEART.
IT’S WHAT MADE THAT BODY.

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:06.419
<i>YOU MUST BELIEVE</i>
<i>IN YOURSELF, HARUYUKI.</i>

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:07.786
HE’S HERE!

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.152
<i>JUDGING FROM WHAT</i>
<i>YOU’VE TOLD ME,</i>

00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:11.386
<i>HE HAS AT LEAST</i>
<i>TWO MAJOR WEAKNESSES.</i>

00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:13.652
<i>THE FIRST ONE BEING</i>
<i>THE NOISE FROM THAT BIKE.</i>

00:13:13.652 --> 00:13:15.519
<i>THE GUIDE CURSOR WILL TELL</i>
<i>YOU WHERE THE ENEMY’S</i>

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:18.452
<i>GENERAL DIRECTION IS,</i>
<i>BUT THAT NOISE WILL TELL YOU</i>

00:13:18.452 --> 00:13:19.652
<i>HIS EXACT LOCATION.</i>

00:13:19.652 --> 00:13:22.652
<i>THIS GIVES YOU AN ADVANTAGE.</i>

00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:24.852
CAN I REALLY DO THIS?

00:13:26.619 --> 00:13:28.086
C’MON, SNAP OUT OF IT!

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:30.752
I’M NOT THE PATHETIC,
CHUBBY KID ARITA NOW!

00:13:30.752 --> 00:13:33.152
I’M SILVER CROW,
THE BURST LINKER!

00:13:33.152 --> 00:13:35.619
THIS IS THE GAME WORLD
I’VE SPENT SO MANY LONG HOURS

00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:38.286
PLAYING AND DOING EVERYTHING
I CAN TO PERFECT MY SKILL.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:44.219
THIS IS MY WORLD!

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:45.252
HUH?

00:13:45.252 --> 00:13:46.886
( screams )

00:13:53.752 --> 00:13:54.886
I--I DID IT!

00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:00.386
( groans )

00:14:00.386 --> 00:14:02.419
I HAVE TO KEEP MOVING!

00:14:04.086 --> 00:14:06.219
Hime: <i>AS FOR ASH ROLLER’S</i>
<i>SECOND WEAKNESS...</i>

00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:08.452
<i>BY THE WAY HIS DUEL AVATAR</i>
<i>IS DESIGNED,</i>

00:14:08.452 --> 00:14:11.419
<i>NEARLY ALL OF ITS POTENTIAL</i>
<i>IS WRAPPED UP IN THAT BIKE.</i>

00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:13.719
<i>THAT MEANS THE COMBAT ABILITY</i>
<i>OF THE RIDER</i>

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.619
<i>HIMSELF SHOULD BE</i>
<i>CLOSE TO ZERO.</i>

00:14:15.619 --> 00:14:17.186
OH, MY FUCKING GOD!

00:14:17.186 --> 00:14:19.086
<i>SO, IF YOU MANAGE TO</i>
<i>DAMAGE HIM BADLY EARLY ON,</i>

00:14:19.086 --> 00:14:21.752
<i>ALL YOU’LL HAVE TO DO IS WAIT</i>
<i>FOR THE TIME TO RUN OUT.</i>

00:14:24.419 --> 00:14:27.419
Green Girl:
WELL, NOW. THE KID’S
NOT THAT BAD.

00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:29.519
Man in Black:
YEAH, HE’S MUCH
BETTER THAN BEFORE.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:31.486
I WONDER WHO
HIS GUARDIAN IS?

00:14:31.486 --> 00:14:33.819
DON’T KNOW, BUT IF
HE WINS THIS, I’LL ADD
HIM TO MY WATCH LIST.

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:36.452
GO GET HIM, KID.
( laughs )

00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:39.719
I DON’T KNOW.
I DOUBT IT’LL BE THAT EASY.

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:41.186
( gasps )

00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:45.152
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
TRYIN’ TO DO?

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:48.119
DON’T THINK YOU’VE WON JUST YET,
NEWBIE.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:53.486
I’M ABOUT READY TO MAKE YOU
DANCE TO THE BEAT OF MY BIKE!

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:55.886
LET’S ROLL!

00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:04.986
AHH!
ISN’T THAT LIKE, CHEATING?

00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:15.319
DAMN, EVEN A SLIGHT GRAZE LIKE
THAT CAUSES YOU TO LOSE POINTS?

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:17.452
THAT’S HARSH!

00:15:17.452 --> 00:15:21.052
THANKS TO THAT BEAT DOWN I WAS
ABLE TO PUT ON YOU THIS MORNING,

00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:23.919
I’VE NOW MOVED UP
AND REACHED LEVEL 2.

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:26.286
THEN, I TOOK THAT
LEVEL-UP BONUS I GOT

00:15:26.286 --> 00:15:29.586
AND CASHED IT IN FOR SOME
AWESOME WALL-CLIMBING POWERS.

00:15:29.586 --> 00:15:32.386
PRETTY SWEET CHOICE BY ME,
RIGHT?

00:15:32.386 --> 00:15:33.752
BUT FOR YOU...

00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:37.419
IT MEANS TERA UNLUCKY!

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.452
AHH!

00:15:42.352 --> 00:15:44.352
Hime: <i>IF YOUR FIRST ATTACK</i>
<i>FAILS TO BE SUCCESSFUL</i>

00:15:44.352 --> 00:15:47.152
<i>OR YOU CAN’T HIDE,</i>
<i>THE CHANCES OF YOU WINNING</i>

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:50.152
<i>THIS FIGHT ARE VERY SMALL.</i>
<i>AND HERE’S WHY.</i>

00:15:50.152 --> 00:15:52.452
BURST LINKER NAMES START
WITH A COLOR,

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.119
IT’S A SORT OF SHORTHAND.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:56.752
AN INDICATION OF THE KIND
OF QUALITIES YOU POSSESS.

00:15:56.752 --> 00:15:58.886
SILVER SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOU.

00:15:58.886 --> 00:16:00.986
IT’S A VERY RARE
AND POWERFUL COLOR.

00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:03.486
YOU ARE RESISTANT TO SLASH
AND PIERCE ATTACKS,

00:16:03.486 --> 00:16:05.119
AS WELL AS FIRE AND POISONS.

00:16:05.119 --> 00:16:07.552
YOU’RE ALSO QUITE GOOD
AT CLOSE RANGE COMBAT.

00:16:07.552 --> 00:16:10.519
BUT YOU’RE VULNERABLE TO
CORROSION AND BLUNT ATTACKS.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.119
I SEE.

00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:15.852
ASH ROLLER’S FAINT COLOR IMPLIES
A UNIQUE ATTACK STYLE.

00:16:15.852 --> 00:16:17.886
IF I WERE TO GUESS AT
WHAT HIS STRENGTH IS,

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:20.152
I’D SAY IT’S DIRECT BLOWS
FROM HIS BIKE.

00:16:20.152 --> 00:16:22.752
WHICH MEANS AGAINST
THAT SORT OF ATTACK

00:16:22.752 --> 00:16:25.886
YOUR ARMOR WILL BE
VIRTUALLY USELESS.

00:16:25.886 --> 00:16:29.386
THIS LEAVES YOU
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION.

00:16:29.386 --> 00:16:32.352
<i>YOU MUST EVADE HIM</i>
<i>UNTIL TIME RUNS OUT.</i>

00:16:32.352 --> 00:16:33.619
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:37.052
( screams )

00:16:37.052 --> 00:16:38.052
DAMN IT!

00:16:38.052 --> 00:16:40.286
YOU EVEN FEEL THE PAIN.
THAT HURT.

00:16:40.286 --> 00:16:42.119
( wild laughing )

00:16:42.119 --> 00:16:44.719
WHAT? NO COUNTER ATTACK,
FUCK-FACE?

00:16:44.719 --> 00:16:46.886
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I GET TO GO AGAIN.

00:16:46.886 --> 00:16:49.686
COME ON.
I NEED SOMETHING.

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:55.152
SOMETHING THAT’S GONNA SAVE ME.
LIKE A SECRET WEAPON.

00:16:55.152 --> 00:16:57.719
OF COURSE!
MY SPECIAL MOVE!

00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:06.286
( murmuring )

00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:08.986
( yelling )

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:10.119
All:
OH!

00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:17.052
( laughing )

00:17:17.052 --> 00:17:19.419
OH, WELL.
GUESS IT’S OVER.

00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:24.052
DAMN IT.
DAMN IT!

00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:27.386
THIS IS MY WORLD.
I’M SUPPOSED TO BE A HERO HERE!

00:17:27.386 --> 00:17:31.019
THIS SUCKS! MY SPECIAL MOVE
DIDN’T EVEN CONNECT.

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:33.852
THERE’S NO WAY I CAN WIN
WITH THIS WEAK AVATAR!

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:36.719
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE!
I CAN’T!

00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:47.886
THE KEY HERE IS YOUR HEART.
IT’S WHAT MADE THAT BODY

00:17:47.886 --> 00:17:50.052
YOU MUST BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF, HARUYUKI.

00:17:50.052 --> 00:17:52.552
LISTEN, IF THERE’S
ONE PERSON IN THIS WORLD

00:17:52.552 --> 00:17:55.586
WHO I FIND IT HARD TO
BELIEVE IN, THAT WOULD BE ME.

00:17:55.586 --> 00:18:00.019
I MEAN COME ON, THIS AVATAR
EVEN LOOKS LIKE A PILE OF TIN.

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:02.786
IF I GOT YOUR HOPES UP,
I’M SORRY.

00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:03.919
JUST FORGET ABOUT ME
AND MOVE ON.

00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:05.686
THAT’S ENOUGH.

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:08.086
YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT.
STRENGTH ISN’T SOLELY

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:10.986
DEFINED BY THE NUMBER
OF VICTORIES YOU HAVE WON.

00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:13.486
UNFORTUNATELY, BY THE TIME
THE TIME I REALIZED THIS,

00:18:13.486 --> 00:18:16.486
IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE.

00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.286
Haru:
NO. I CAN’T GIVE UP.

00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:21.152
EVEN IF I LOSE,
I’VE GOTTA KEEP ON GOING

00:18:21.152 --> 00:18:24.286
AND CLAWING MY WAY BACK
’TIL THE BITTER END.

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:28.219
IF I’M GOIN’ DOWN,
I’M GOIN’ DOWN FIGHTING!

00:18:28.219 --> 00:18:30.619
THAT’S WHAT A PAWN
IS SUPPOSED TO DO!

00:18:30.619 --> 00:18:32.886
( laughing )

00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:37.419
COME ON, THINK.

00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:39.952
I’VE PLAYED HOURS
AND HOURS OF GAMES.

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:43.319
IF THIS IS JUST
LIKE THE REAL WORLD,

00:18:43.319 --> 00:18:45.386
THEN THAT BIKE’S GOTTA
HAVE A WEAK POINT.

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:48.519
AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE
FROM THE 20TH CENTURY.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:50.119
WHAT’S ITS WEAKNESS?

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.919
THINK!

00:18:55.752 --> 00:18:57.219
THAT’S IT!

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:58.886
( laughing )

00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:00.919
READY TO DANCE SOME MORE?!

00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:03.986
JUST THIS ONCE, SILVER CROW,
MOVE FOR ME!

00:19:03.986 --> 00:19:05.852
WE’VE GOTTA BE
FASTER THAN HIM!

00:19:11.152 --> 00:19:13.686
EVEN IF I CAN’T BELIEVE
IN MYSELF,

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:15.886
( gasping )

00:19:15.886 --> 00:19:17.552
( grunting )

00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:21.352
I CAN AT LEAST BELIEVE IN
EVERYTHING SHE’S SAID!

00:19:23.186 --> 00:19:24.886
( laughing )

00:19:24.886 --> 00:19:27.419
DUMB ASS! DO YOU REALLY
THINK A LITTLE SHIT STAIN

00:19:27.419 --> 00:19:29.886
LIKE YOU CAN STOP A
MONSTER BIKE LIKE THIS?!

00:19:34.386 --> 00:19:36.452
( grunting )

00:19:36.452 --> 00:19:38.152
( laughing )

00:19:38.152 --> 00:19:41.386
YOU BETTER LET GO KID, OR YOU’RE
GONNA BE GROUND DOWN TO A NUB.

00:19:41.386 --> 00:19:42.886
( yelling )

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:48.386
( laughing )

00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:51.452
ALMOST THERE.

00:20:01.586 --> 00:20:04.219
IT’S ALL OVER!

00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:07.752
OKAY, HERE I GO!

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:11.986
( gasping )

00:20:14.619 --> 00:20:16.286
HUH? WHA...

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:20.452
( growling )

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:26.119
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:28.086
WHOA!
PRETTY SMART.

00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:31.752
ALL BIKES WITH INTERNAL
COMBUSTION ENGINES HAVE
REAR WHEEL DRIVE.

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:32.852
SO IF YOU HOLD THE BACK END UP

00:20:32.852 --> 00:20:35.552
THEY BECOME TOTALLY USELESS.

00:20:35.552 --> 00:20:39.019
ASH ROLLER IS NOW LIKE A TURTLE
THAT’S BEEN FLIPPED ON ITS BACK.

00:20:39.019 --> 00:20:42.319
I’M IMPRESSED.
WELL PLAYED, SILVER CROW.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:45.152
YOU’RE ADDED TO THE LIST.
I’M ROOTING FOR YA’.

00:20:49.452 --> 00:20:50.686
( sigh of relief )

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:52.886
PUT ME DOWN, YA’ LITTLE
FART BREATHER!

00:20:52.886 --> 00:20:54.452
LET GO OF ME ALREADY.

00:20:54.452 --> 00:20:55.886
FORGET THAT.
TRY USING YOUR FRONT TIRE

00:20:55.886 --> 00:20:57.352
IF YOU WANNA
GO SOMEWHERE.

00:20:57.352 --> 00:20:58.652
( growling )

00:20:58.652 --> 00:21:00.286
DON’T MESS WITH ME!

00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:08.019
YOU SON OF A BITCH,
YOU’RE GONNA PAY!

00:21:14.586 --> 00:21:15.919
( sighs )

00:21:15.919 --> 00:21:17.319
YOU DID IT,
SILVER CROW!

00:21:17.319 --> 00:21:19.319
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I THOUGH YOU WERE DONE FOR.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:22.619
YEAH, I KNOW.
MORE THAN ONCE I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING MYSELF.

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:24.352
DON’T BE SO MODEST.

00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:26.152
YOU EARNED THAT VICTORY.

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:27.186
NOT REALLY.

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:30.152
SO, WERE YOU ABLE TO
GET YOUR POINTS BACK?

00:21:30.152 --> 00:21:32.452
YEAH, I GOT ’EM BACK
AND THEN SOME MORE.

00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:35.719
I GUESS THAT’S BECAUSE HE WAS
UP TO LEVEL TWO ON THIS ROUND.

00:21:36.652 --> 00:21:38.386
( laughs )

00:21:38.386 --> 00:21:42.552
OF COURSE. SO THAT
EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS ABLE
TO CLIMB UP THOSE WALLS.

00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:45.286
I KNOW, WHEN I SAW THAT
I COULDN’T BELIEVE IT!

00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:49.019
IT WAS A GREAT WIN, HARUYUKI.
NICELY DONE.

00:21:49.019 --> 00:21:51.319
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WE SHOULD GO CELEBRATE.

00:21:51.319 --> 00:21:52.886
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE...

00:21:52.886 --> 00:21:55.419
( gasping )

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:57.286
( yells )

00:21:57.286 --> 00:21:59.152
CHIYU!

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:01.086
JUST WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH HARU?

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.686
DON’T YOU SEE WHAT
YOU’VE DONE?

00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:04.819
BECAUSE YOU WENT
AND EGGED SOMEONE
ON YESTERDAY,

00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:06.686
HARU HERE
GOT BEATEN UP AGAIN.

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:08.452
AND NOW YOU’RE
STILL DOING IT.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.452
YOU’RE MAKING
A SPECTACLE OF HIM
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

00:22:10.452 --> 00:22:12.619
WHAT SORT OF PLAN
ARE YOU HATCHING?

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:14.386
OH...

00:22:14.386 --> 00:22:16.819
( gasping )

00:22:18.352 --> 00:22:21.814
