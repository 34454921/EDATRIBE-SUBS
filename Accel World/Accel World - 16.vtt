WEBVTT

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.978
Sky Raker:
SO. YOU MUST BE
SILVER CROW.

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.313
IT’S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.679
MY NAME IS SKY RAKER.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.546
I’M HAPPY YOU
CAME OUT HERE TO SEE ME.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:20.379
( gasps )

00:00:20.379 --> 00:00:22.279
YEAH, WELL,
OKAY, MASTER.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.913
I GUESS I’M, UH,
GONNA GET GOIN’ THEN.

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:27.479
HUH?
HOLD ON A SEC.
WHAT ABOUT ME?

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:29.713
LISTEN UP, CROW.

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:33.313
I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S GOIN’ ON
WITH YOUR PUNK ASS, BUT JUST
BECAUSE YOU LOST YOUR WINGS

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:36.046
DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD
GIVE UP ON THEM SO EASILY.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.579
IF YOU DID THAT, THEN FOR ALL
OF US DUDES WHO’VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU FLY AROUND THIS WHOLE TIME,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.313
IT’D BE...
DAMN IT!

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:46.579
I DON’T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT,
SO JUST DO SOMETHING,
YA BIG PANTY WASTE!

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.179
B-BUT HOW?

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:49.679
Sky Raker:
MR. CROW.

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.479
THIS IS WHERE
ASH THINKS I MAY
BE OF SOME USE.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.979
PERHAPS THERE’S A WAY
I CAN HELP GET
YOUR WINGS BACK.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.279
WHAT? YOU GUYS ARE
WILLING TO HELP ME?

00:00:58.279 --> 00:01:00.579
BUT...AREN’T YOU WITH
THE GREEN LEGION?

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:01.913
DON’T GET THE
WRONG IDEA.

00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:03.979
I’M NOT DOING THIS
FOR YOU.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.113
SEE, IT’S ALL
PART OF A PLAN.

00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:08.546
A SECRET MISSION TO
BOOST MY POPULARITY.

00:01:08.546 --> 00:01:13.146
THEN WE’LL GET YA OVER ON OUR
SIDE AND HAVE YOUR SHINY ASS
TURN ON THE BLACK LEGION.

00:01:13.146 --> 00:01:15.546
MEGA FUCK YEAH,
BABY! ( laughs )

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.346
ASH, YOU’RE BEING
CRUDE AGAIN.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:19.246
OH!
SO SORRY, MASTER!

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:28.946
DESPITE ASH’S FOUL MOUTH,
LOOKS, AND GENERAL LACK
OF INTELLIGENCE,

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:31.646
THERE ARE MANY
GOOD PARTS AS WELL.

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:34.646
<i>SO THAT’S...</i>
<i>SKY RAKER...</i>

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:40.246
<i>ONCE KNOWN AS THE ONLY BURST</i>
<i>LINKER IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD</i>
<i>WHO EVER CAME CLOSE TO FLYING.</i>

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:42.979
UM...SO,
MISS RAKER.?

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.646
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN HELP ME
GET MY WINGS BACK?

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:49.513
I’M AFRAID
THE ANSWER IS NO.
( gasps )

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:53.379
WHENEVER YOU LOSE
SOMETHING FROM YOUR DUEL
AVATAR, IT’S NEVER RANDOM.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.913
THERE’S ALWAYS SOME SORT OF
REASON BEHIND IT.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:02:00.346
AND WHATEVER THAT REASON IS,
I CAN’T HELP MAKE IT GO AWAY.

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:02.179
SO, THEY’RE GONE FOR GOOD?

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.679
YES. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO
IN THIS GARDEN, YOUR WINGS
WILL NEVER COME BACK.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.579
BUT...THAT DOESN’T MEAN
YOU WON’T FLY AGAIN.

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.246
( gasps )

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:16.679
♪

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.180
I’VE BEEN RATHER
INTERESTED IN YOU FOR
QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.113
SEVEN YEARS AFTER
THE INCEPTION OF
ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:56.847
WE FINALLY HAVE
AN AVATAR WITH
AVIATION ABILITIES.

00:03:56.847 --> 00:03:58.947
IT MAKES ME WONDER
WHAT SORT OF SOUL YOU HAVE.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.747
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS
YOU CARRY.

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:05.247
THOSE TRAITS HAVE CREATED
A POWER THAT DEFIES GRAVITY.

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:06.647
IT’S NOTHING SPECIAL.

00:04:06.647 --> 00:04:09.313
I WAS JUST BULLIED
A WHOLE LOT IN REAL LIFE.

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:13.180
AND I DON’T KNOW IF I
WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO CALL
THEM "PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS."

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.947
DON’T FORGET, THE SCARS THAT
DEFINE THE LOOK OF YOUR AVATAR

00:04:16.947 --> 00:04:20.113
AREN’T SOLELY ABOUT HOW MUCH
ANGER OR HATRED YOU HAVE.

00:04:20.113 --> 00:04:21.347
HUH?

00:04:21.347 --> 00:04:23.647
A SCAR IS A SIGN THAT
SOMETHING’S MISSING.

00:04:23.647 --> 00:04:28.047
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO YOU
HAS BEEN REMOVED, LEAVING
A HOLE IN YOUR HEART.

00:04:28.047 --> 00:04:32.113
HAVING THAT EMPTY HOLE
CAN LEAD YOU TO ANGER,
HATRED, OR DESPAIR.

00:04:32.113 --> 00:04:35.313
OR IT CAN DO THE OPPOSITE
AND PUSH YOU TO REACH HIGHER.

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:38.947
THE DIRECTION YOU CHOOSE
IS REFLECTED IN THE
STATE OF YOUR AVATAR.

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:44.447
IN OTHER WORDS, THOSE
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS ARE
YOUR HOPES TURNED INSIDE OUT.

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:48.980
SILVER CROW, YOUR WISH
FOR THE SKY WAS STRONGER
THAN ANYONE ELSE’S.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.513
AND IT WAS THE STRENGTH OF THAT
WISH THAT GAVE YOU YOUR AVIATION
ABILITY AND YOUR WINGS.

00:04:55.513 --> 00:04:59.347
IT WASN’T YOUR WINGS
THAT GAVE YOU FLIGHT.
IT’S THE OPPOSITE.

00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:03.480
IT’S BECAUSE YOU ALREADY
<i>HAD</i> THE CAPACITY TO FLY
THAT YOU HAD WINGS.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.613
REALLY?
SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:09.013
THAT I DIDN’T ACTUALLY
NEED MY WINGS, THAT
THEY WERE JUST FOR SHOW?

00:05:09.013 --> 00:05:11.513
IN A LITERAL
INTERPRETATION, YES.

00:05:11.513 --> 00:05:13.380
THERE’S NO WAY!

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.713
LOOK, EVEN IF I DID
TRULY WANNA FLY, BRAIN BURST
IS WHAT SENSED THAT IN ME.

00:05:16.713 --> 00:05:19.413
THAT’S WHAT GAVE ME
MY WINGS AND AVIATION ABILITY.

00:05:19.413 --> 00:05:22.047
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

00:05:22.047 --> 00:05:24.280
SO, BASICALLY,
WHAT YOU’RE SAYING...

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.547
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,
WILL POWER MEANS NOTHING.

00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:30.780
( gasps )

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.780
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT
MY WHEELCHAIR.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.213
IT HAS NO CONTROLS
AND NO MOTOR ATTACHED.

00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:40.647
HOWEVER...

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.713
NO WAY.

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:51.347
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS
OF BRAIN BURST IS TO MIMIC
REALITY AS CLOSELY AS IT CAN.

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:54.380
AND YET...
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.913
WHAT’S ACTUALLY
POWERING YOUR CHAIR?

00:05:56.913 --> 00:06:00.780
THE ONLY THING THAT’S
MAKING MY CHAIR MOVE
IS WILL POWER.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.413
YOU MEAN LIKE, SOME SORT
OF PSYCHOKINETIC ABILITY?

00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:06.447
NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:12.947
THE TRUTH IS, EVERY PLAYER
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD HAS
THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS AS WELL.

00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:14.347
( gasps )

00:06:14.347 --> 00:06:16.447
( giggles )
YOU DON’T BELIEVE ME?

00:06:16.447 --> 00:06:21.513
YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND BETTER IF
YOU THINK OF IT AS VISUALIZATION
POWER INSTEAD OF WILL POWER.

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:23.180
VISUALIZATION?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.480
FIRST, I FULLY VISUALIZE
AN IMAGE OF MY TWO
WHEELS SET IN MOTION.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.180
AND THROUGH THE INCARNATION
OF THIS IMAGE, I CAN
CONTROL MY WHEELCHAIR.

00:06:35.213 --> 00:06:37.947
( gasps )
I’M SURE THAT
WHEN YOU’RE FLYING,

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:42.680
YOU’RE SUBCONSCIOUSLY USING THE
SAME METHOD TO POWER YOUR WINGS.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.647
OUR POWER TO VISUALIZE...

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:49.347
THAT IS THE TRUE POWER
HIDDEN WITHIN ALL BURST LINKERS.

00:06:49.347 --> 00:06:52.313
AND FOR THE PLAYERS WHO HAVE
MANAGED TO MASTER THIS SKILL

00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:56.347
AND USE THIS POWER
TO CONTROL THINGS...
THEY HAVE A NAME FOR IT.

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:58.480
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.513
A POWER THAT TAPS INTO
YOUR HEART’S DEEPEST HOPES.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR WILL.

00:07:03.513 --> 00:07:07.480
THE INCARNATE...
SYSTEM?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.847
SO, ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
THAT IF I CAN SOMEHOW LEARN TO
USE THIS INCARNATE SYSTEM...

00:07:11.847 --> 00:07:15.513
THEN I’LL BE
ABLE TO FLY AGAIN?

00:07:15.513 --> 00:07:18.080
LET ME SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.180
( gasps )
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR LEGS?

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.847
WERE THEY STOLEN FROM YOU,
LIKE MY WINGS?

00:07:22.847 --> 00:07:24.313
NOT EXACTLY.

00:07:24.313 --> 00:07:28.913
I WANTED TO HAVE THEM
CUT OFF. SO I GOT SOMEONE
TO DO IT FOR ME.

00:07:28.913 --> 00:07:33.147
IT WAS AN ACT OF
ARROGANCE, EGOTISM,
AND INSANITY.

00:07:33.147 --> 00:07:35.713
BUT AT THE
TIME, THAT’S WHAT I DID.

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:40.280
TO FORCE MY WILL OF WANTING
TO FLY TO BE AS STRONG AS
IT POSSIBLY COULD.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.113
( gasps)
DID IT WORK?
COULD YOU FLY?

00:07:44.113 --> 00:07:45.313
NO.

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:49.113
INCARNATION DID HELP INCREASE
MY JUMPING ABILITY.

00:07:49.113 --> 00:07:53.747
BUT I’M AFRAID I NEVER
DID QUITE MAKE IT TO FLYING.

00:07:53.747 --> 00:07:55.780
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MR. CROW?

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.180
NOW THAT YOU’VE SEEN
THESE FOOLISH SCARS,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.313
DO YOU STILL WISH TO
LEARN HOW TO FLY USING
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM?

00:08:03.313 --> 00:08:09.513
LOOK...I CAN’T QUIT.
THERE’S STILL A TON
OF THINGS THAT I HAVE TO DO.

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:12.313
SO PLEASE, TEACH ME
HOW TO USE INCARNATION!

00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:15.780
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.980
THERE’S EVEN THE POSSIBILITY
THAT IT WILL TAKE YOU

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.880
PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN
FOR A BURST LINKER.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.513
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT WHATEVER IT TAKES,
I’LL DO IT.

00:08:24.513 --> 00:08:27.580
VERY WELL, THEN.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.847
BUT FOR NOW, WE REST.

00:08:28.847 --> 00:08:32.113
THAT’S ENOUGH
FOR TODAY.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:38.380
HERE YOU ARE.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.113
UM...

00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:41.513
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

00:08:41.513 --> 00:08:45.347
UH, I DON’T REALLY
HAVE A MOUTH...

00:08:45.347 --> 00:08:46.780
AAH!

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:51.280
UH, NEVER MIND.
SORRY.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.413
( slurping )

00:08:52.413 --> 00:08:53.680
IT’S AMAZING!

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.047
TAKE YOUR TIME
AND FULLY SAVOR
THE TASTE.

00:08:56.047 --> 00:08:58.947
MAKE IT A MEMORY
THAT WILL TRULY LAST.

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:06.113
UM, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?
GO AHEAD.

00:09:06.113 --> 00:09:10.147
IT’S ABOUT MR. ASH.
HAS HE BEEN TRAINED
ON INCARNATION?

00:09:10.147 --> 00:09:11.547
NOT PROPERLY.

00:09:11.547 --> 00:09:14.713
I’VE GIVEN MY PROTEGE A FEW
TIPS, BUT THAT’S ABOUT IT.

00:09:14.713 --> 00:09:16.680
ASH IS TRYING HARD, THOUGH.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.147
IF YOU’RE HIS GUARDIAN,
DOES THAT MEAN YOU’RE IN
THE GREEN LEGION TOO?

00:09:21.147 --> 00:09:22.113
NO.

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:24.513
I’VE ONLY EVER BEEN
IN ONE LEGION.

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:27.480
AND I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF CHANGING THAT.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.813
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE
THE RIGHT TO KNOW
WHICH ONE IT IS.

00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:40.780
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE BEDTIME STORY.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.180
ABOUT A FOOLISH BURST LINKER
WHO REACHED FOR THE SKY.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.647
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
ONE AND ONLY FRIEND.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.013
ALL RIGHT, WE’RE
ABOUT TO START YOUR
INCARNATION TRAINING.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:57.880
I’M READY.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.913
AND I PROMISE
TO DO MY BEST.

00:09:59.913 --> 00:10:03.547
THE ESSENCE OF
INCARNATION CAN BE
DISTILLED INTO ONE WORD.

00:10:03.547 --> 00:10:07.480
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND
IT, YOU CAN USE IT
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.647
JUST ONE WORD?

00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:10.480
THAT’S RIGHT.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.947
WELL, WILL YOU TELL
ME WHAT THAT WORD IS?

00:10:12.947 --> 00:10:14.380
OF COURSE.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.247
HOWEVER...

00:10:16.247 --> 00:10:19.080
( stammering )

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.513
I’D PREFER TO TELL YOU
THE NEXT TIME WE MEET.

00:10:22.513 --> 00:10:24.980
( yelling )

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:47.875
KNOWING MISS RAKER,
I SHOULD HAVE GUESSED
IT WASN’T GOING TO BE EASY.

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.242
"NEXT TIME WE MEET"?

00:10:49.242 --> 00:10:52.008
SO I GOTTA CLIMB
TO THE TOP OF THIS THING?

00:10:52.008 --> 00:10:54.642
THAT’S ASKING A LOT.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.842
BUT I’LL DO IT.

00:10:58.608 --> 00:11:03.242
ALL RIGHT. I’VE PLAYED
A FEW CLIMBING GAMES BEFORE.
JUST WATCH!

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:11.808
I’VE MANAGED TO COME
PRETTY FAR.

00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:12.808
( grunting )

00:11:12.808 --> 00:11:14.142
<i>IT’S OKAY.</i>

00:11:14.142 --> 00:11:15.608
<i>MY AVATAR’S BODY</i>
<i>IS SLIM AND SMOOTH,</i>

00:11:15.608 --> 00:11:17.342
<i>AND HAS VERY LITTLE</i>
<i>AIR RESISTANCE.</i>

00:11:17.342 --> 00:11:19.908
<i>SO I SHOULDN’T BE</i>
<i>BLOWN OFF THAT EASILY.</i>

00:11:23.942 --> 00:11:26.442
GREAT, I’M NEARLY THERE.

00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:28.842
IF I CAN CLIMB ALL THE WAY TO
THE TOP ON MY FIRST DAY,

00:11:28.842 --> 00:11:31.408
MISS RAKER IS GONNA BE
TOTALLY IMPRESS--

00:11:37.108 --> 00:11:39.842
WHAT? A TRANSITION?
DAMN IT!

00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:45.642
( gasping )

00:11:55.942 --> 00:11:58.275
THE DEMONIC
CITY STAGE.

00:12:01.942 --> 00:12:04.175
THAT SEEMS
PRETTY SOLID.

00:12:04.175 --> 00:12:05.242
( grunts )

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:07.842
OW!

00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:13.042
DO I HAVE TO JUST
WAIT HERE FOR THE
NEXT TRANSITION?

00:12:13.042 --> 00:12:15.508
HUH?

00:12:15.508 --> 00:12:19.942
UH...
WHAT’S THIS?

00:12:19.942 --> 00:12:23.408
AH, THANKS, I’M STARVING!

00:12:26.075 --> 00:12:28.808
Sky Raker:
<i>YOUR INCARNATION</i>
<i>TRAINING HAS BEGUN.</i>

00:12:28.808 --> 00:12:32.708
<i>ASK YOURSELF WHY</i>
<i>YOU WEREN’T BLOWN AWAY</i>
<i>BY THE WIND YESTERDAY.</i>

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.708
WHY WASN’T I...?
( gasps )

00:12:37.342 --> 00:12:39.008
I’VE GOT IT!

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.508
INCARNATION IS ALL ABOUT
VISUALIZING YOUR WILL.

00:12:41.508 --> 00:12:45.442
AT THAT MOMENT, I NEVER
THOUGHT FOR A SECOND
I’D BE BLOWN OFF.

00:12:45.442 --> 00:12:48.608
OKAY. IF THAT’S HOW
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM
WORKS, THEN...

00:12:48.608 --> 00:12:50.342
I’VE JUST GOT TO BELIEVE.

00:12:50.342 --> 00:12:52.842
THIS IS NOTHING MORE
THAN A PROGRAM OBJECT.

00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:57.408
WHICH MEANS...I SHOULD
BE ABLE TO BREAK IT!

00:12:57.408 --> 00:13:00.308
( whimpering )
OW...

00:13:03.475 --> 00:13:05.242
YES!

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.942
OKAY. NOW THINK.

00:13:06.942 --> 00:13:09.308
VISUALIZE THAT YOUR FINGERS
AND ARM ARE A BLADE!

00:13:16.175 --> 00:13:18.475
IT’S WORKING!

00:13:18.475 --> 00:13:20.175
( grunting )

00:13:29.142 --> 00:13:30.908
( sighs )

00:13:30.908 --> 00:13:32.875
"GOOD LUCK, CROW."
THAT’S ALL SHE SAID?

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:35.375
NO INSTRUCTIONS
THIS MORNING?

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:44.008
WELL. I GUESS I HAVE TO ASSUME
THAT MEANS SHE’S ALREADY GIVEN
ME ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED.

00:13:44.008 --> 00:13:45.808
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
I’M MISSING, THOUGH...

00:13:45.808 --> 00:13:47.608
Sky Raker:
<i>REMEMBER...</i>

00:13:47.608 --> 00:13:49.208
<i>THE POWER</i>
<i>TO VISUALIZE.</i>

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:52.508
<i>THAT IS THE TRUE POWER HIDDEN</i>
<i>WITHIN ALL BURST LINKERS.</i>

00:13:52.508 --> 00:13:55.408
Kuroyukihime:
<i>HARUYUKI, YOU’RE</i>
<i>THE FASTEST THERE IS.</i>

00:13:55.408 --> 00:14:00.108
<i>SOMEDAY...YOU’RE GOING</i>
<i>TO BE FASTER THAN ME</i>
<i>AND THE OTHER KINGS.</i>

00:14:00.108 --> 00:14:03.108
<i>AND AS A BURST LINKER,</i>
<i>SPEED IS YOUR GREATEST POWER.</i>

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:06.208
WAIT...THAT MEANS
WHEN KUROYUKIHIME
SENPAI TOLD ME THAT,

00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:08.675
SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN ALL
ABOUT THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

00:14:08.675 --> 00:14:12.975
AND ACCORDING TO WHAT SHE
SAID, THE GREATEST POWER
ANYONE CAN HAVE IS SPEED.

00:14:12.975 --> 00:14:16.708
SO I SHOULD BE VISUALIZING
SPEED, NOT POWER.

00:14:16.708 --> 00:14:19.442
CREATE THE IMAGE
AND CONTROL IT.

00:14:19.442 --> 00:14:21.508
IMAGINE SPEED AT ITS MAXIMUM.

00:14:21.508 --> 00:14:23.875
GRASP IT, AND THEN MAKE IT REAL!

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:31.908
YES!

00:14:31.908 --> 00:14:33.742
Sky Raker:
<i>DO YOUR BEST!</i>

00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:48.742
COME ON.
( grunts )

00:14:58.342 --> 00:14:59.775
LET’S KEEP GOING.

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:03.308
THIS TIME...TO THE VERY TOP!

00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:11.242
Sky Raker: <i>FROM THE BEGINNING,</i>
<i>MY AVATAR HAD ITS OWN</i>
<i>SPECIFIC ENHANCED ARMAMENT.</i>

00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:13.608
<i>WITH JUST A QUICK BURST</i>
<i>OF PROPULSION,</i>

00:15:13.608 --> 00:15:18.308
<i>I COULD LEAP FROM</i>
<i>THE GROUND AND JUMP</i>
<i>100 METERS INTO THE AIR.</i>

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:27.475
<i>BUT BEFORE LONG, THE DESIRE</i>
<i>TO SOAR EVEN HIGHER HAD</i>
<i>COMPLETELY CONSUMED ME.</i>

00:15:27.475 --> 00:15:31.842
<i>I FOUGHT DUELS FOR THE SOLE</i>
<i>PURPOSE OF INCREASING MY</i>
<i>AVATAR’S JUMPING ABILITY.</i>

00:15:31.842 --> 00:15:36.375
<i>AND BEFORE LONG,</i>
<i>I HAD REACHED LEVEL 8,</i>
<i>BUT THEN I REALIZED...</i>

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:42.542
JUMPING WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME
AS FLYING, AND THAT’S THE MOMENT
MY DESIRE BECAME AN OBSESSION.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:47.275
IT DROVE ME
COMPLETELY INSANE.

00:15:47.275 --> 00:15:51.508
AND IN THE MIDST OF
THIS INSANITY, I DID
SOMETHING VERY FOOLISH.

00:15:51.508 --> 00:15:54.575
IN AN ATTEMPT TO LIGHTEN MY
AVATAR AND STRENGTHEN MY WILL,

00:15:54.575 --> 00:16:00.375
I DECIDED TO RID MYSELF
OF MY MOST VALUABLE
WEAPON...MY OWN LEGS.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:04.108
SO WHAT I DID NEXT WAS TURN
TO THE MASTER OF MY LEGION,

00:16:04.108 --> 00:16:08.308
A CLOSE FRIEND AND THE
ONLY PERSON I KNEW WHO
UNDERSTOOD MY OBSESSION,

00:16:08.308 --> 00:16:12.875
AND ASKED HER TO
CUT THEM OFF WITH HER BLADES.

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:16.575
WAIT A SEC.
WAS THIS FRIEND...?

00:16:16.575 --> 00:16:18.475
IT WAS BLACK LOTUS.

00:16:18.475 --> 00:16:23.842
SHE WAS STRONGER AND MORE
HONORABLE THAT ANYONE.
BUT SHE WAS ALSO VERY KIND.

00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:26.708
MY ONE TRUE
AND ONLY FRIEND.

00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:28.608
SHE DID HER
BEST TO STOP ME.

00:16:28.608 --> 00:16:32.775
BUT ALL I DID IN RETURN
WAS SAY HORRIBLE,
UNFORGIVABLE THINGS TO HER.

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:37.875
UNTIL EVENTUALLY, WITH A
LOOK ON HER FACE SO SAD
THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET IT,

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:41.008
SHE GRANTED MY REQUEST.

00:16:41.008 --> 00:16:45.508
IN THE END, I WAS ABLE
TO REACH A HEIGHT OF 350 METERS.

00:16:45.508 --> 00:16:50.508
JUST ENOUGH TO REACH
THE TOP OF THIS PLACE,
THE OLD TOKYO TOWER.

00:16:50.508 --> 00:16:55.508
AND THEN I REALIZED SOMETHING:
SEEING THE SKY AT THE PEAK
OF MY TRAJECTORY,

00:16:55.508 --> 00:17:01.575
FOR ONLY A BRIEF INSTANT,
IS THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT
OF MY POWERS.

00:17:01.575 --> 00:17:05.142
Haru: BUT I...

00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:06.675
( gasping )

00:17:06.675 --> 00:17:08.042
I WANT TO GO HIGHER!

00:17:12.608 --> 00:17:14.508
I WANT TO FLY...

00:17:14.508 --> 00:17:16.975
TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!

00:17:19.575 --> 00:17:21.542
( panting )

00:17:21.542 --> 00:17:24.042
Sky Raker:
WELCOME BACK,
MR. CROW.

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.542
YOU MANAGED TO RETURN
MUCH SOONER THAN I
EXPECTED YOU TO.

00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:29.242
NO WONDER SHE
CHOSE YOU.

00:17:29.242 --> 00:17:32.242
I SHOULDN’T HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
THAT DISTANCE...

00:17:32.242 --> 00:17:36.142
BUT SOMEHOW,
I JUST KNEW
THAT I WOULD.

00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:40.908
IF THAT’S THE POWER OF
INCARNATION, IT’S MORE THAN
JUST OPERATING AN AVATAR.

00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:43.708
IT WAS LIKE
OVERRIDING
REALITY ITSELF!

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:47.908
EXACTLY.
"OVERRIDE."
YOU RESHAPED REALITY.

00:17:47.908 --> 00:17:52.808
AND THAT’S THE ONE
WORD YOU NEED TO KNOW.
THE KEY TO INCARNATION.

00:17:52.808 --> 00:17:54.575
"OVERRIDE."

00:17:54.575 --> 00:17:58.242
ORIGINALLY, VISUALIZATION
CONTROL WAS JUST MEANT
TO BE A SUPPORT TOOL.

00:17:58.242 --> 00:18:02.108
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
AS THE IMAGES BECAME
FASTER AND STRONGER,

00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:04.842
THEY OVERRODE
THE CONSTRAINTS
OF THE PROGRAM.

00:18:04.842 --> 00:18:07.608
IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR
WILL RESHAPES REALITY.

00:18:07.608 --> 00:18:11.642
AND WITH THAT, I NO
LONGER HAVE ANYTHING
LEFT TO TEACH YOU.

00:18:11.642 --> 00:18:14.442
BUT...I STILL CAN’T
REALLY DO ANYTHING!

00:18:14.442 --> 00:18:19.075
I TOLD YOU...IN THE
END, I WAS NEVER ABLE
TO REACH THE SKY.

00:18:19.075 --> 00:18:21.875
YEAH, BUT...
I WANNA FLY!

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:23.708
NO, IT’S MORE
THAN THAT.

00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:25.342
I <i>HAVE</i> TO FLY AGAIN!

00:18:25.342 --> 00:18:27.908
I HAVE TO DO IT
SO I CAN FIGHT
BESIDE HER!

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:31.242
DON’T WORRY.
I’M GOING TO GIVE
YOU SOME WINGS.

00:18:31.242 --> 00:18:34.475
MY ENHANCED ARMAMENT,
GALE THRUSTER.

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:35.875
AND THEN WHAT?

00:18:35.875 --> 00:18:37.975
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE
ABLE TO USE THOSE WINGS

00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:41.242
TO REACH HEIGHTS
THAT I COULD HAVE
NEVER IMAGINED.

00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:55.375
Sky Raker:
HELLO, MR. CROW.

00:18:55.375 --> 00:18:57.708
OH, HI, GOOD MORNING!

00:18:57.708 --> 00:18:58.842
MORNING.

00:18:58.842 --> 00:19:01.975
SO, UM...HOW DID
YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.508
I USED INCARNATION.

00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:04.975
HUH?

00:19:04.975 --> 00:19:07.742
I’M JOKING.
IT WASN’T
THAT HARD.

00:19:07.742 --> 00:19:09.575
THERE AREN’T A WHOLE LOT OF
STUDENTS HANGING AROUND

00:19:09.575 --> 00:19:12.642
THE OUTSIDE OF A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT AT THIS TIME OF DAY.

00:19:12.642 --> 00:19:14.408
( giggles )

00:19:14.408 --> 00:19:19.508
Haru: LOOK I...
I JUST WANNA THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING YOU’VE DONE.

00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:24.342
AND ALSO...THANKS FOR
COMING ALL THE WAY HERE.
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

00:19:24.342 --> 00:19:26.175
OF COURSE,
DON’T MENTION IT.

00:19:26.175 --> 00:19:29.675
THE ONLY WAY TO EXCHANGE
ENHANCED ARMAMENTS
WITHOUT USING A SHOP

00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:33.675
IS BY CABLE-LINKING
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:35.308
Both: BURST LINK.

00:19:42.342 --> 00:19:45.375
Haru: <i>THE GALE THRUSTER.</i>
<i>IT’S AMAZING.</i>

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:50.475
<i>AM I REALLY GONNA BE</i>
<i>ABLE TO MASTER THIS THING?</i>

00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:52.275

<i>TO SOAR EVEN HIGHER...</i>

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:57.875
<i>HAD COMPLETELY</i>
<i>CONSUMED ME.</i>

00:19:57.875 --> 00:19:59.875
HER LEGS...

00:19:59.875 --> 00:20:01.508
<i>SHE HAS PROSTHETIC LEGS.</i>

00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:05.308
<i>THAT’S WHY SHE WANTED</i>

00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:09.042
<i>MY PROBLEMS ARE NOTHING</i>
<i>COMPARED TO WHAT SHE</i>
<i>HAS TO GO THROUGH.</i>

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:10.942
<i>AND YET SHE’S WILLING</i>
<i>TO GIVE UP HER WINGS</i>

00:20:10.942 --> 00:20:14.442
<i>FOR SOMEONE AS</i>
<i>PATHETIC AS ME.</i>

00:20:14.442 --> 00:20:16.308
YOU HAVE
A KIND HEART.

00:20:16.308 --> 00:20:19.875
I’M DON’T! THAT’S NOT
TRUE AT ALL. I’M SORRY.

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:22.708
<i>NO!</i>
<i>STOP THIS.</i>
<i>DON’T CRY!</i>

00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:24.642
( sobbing )

00:20:24.642 --> 00:20:26.808
LISTEN,
MR. CROW.

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:28.408
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:20:28.408 --> 00:20:31.975
I DIDN’T AGREE TO
HELP YOU OUT BECAUSE
I PITY YOU, OKAY?

00:20:31.975 --> 00:20:35.742
JUST AS I KNOW YOU WOULD NEVER
DO SOMETHING OUT OF PITY FOR ME.

00:20:35.742 --> 00:20:41.542
THOSE TEARS ARE PROOF THAT YOU
WILL FIND SOME SORT OF TRUTH FOR
YOURSELF IN ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:20:41.542 --> 00:20:43.208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:45.875
( giggles )

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.908
PEOPLE WHO USE BRAIN BURST
FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH GAINS,

00:20:48.908 --> 00:20:52.008
TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THEMSELVES IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:54.808
THEY WOULD NEVER
SHED TEARS LIKE THAT.

00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:59.242
FOR THOSE PEOPLE, DUELS
ARE JUST A WAY FOR
THEM TO ACQUIRE POINTS,

00:20:59.242 --> 00:21:04.908
MAKING ACCELERATED WORLD
NOTHING MORE THAN A PLACE
TO HUNT AND HURT OTHERS.

00:21:04.908 --> 00:21:06.908
BUT YOU AND ME,
WE KNOW BETTER.

00:21:06.908 --> 00:21:09.408
WE KNOW IT’S A PLACE
WHERE MUCH MORE
CAN BE FOUND.

00:21:09.408 --> 00:21:15.108
TRUTH, FRIENDSHIP,
LOVE...EVEN BONDS
CAN BE FORMED THERE.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.742
AM I RIGHT?

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:21.808
YES.
YOU ARE.

00:21:21.808 --> 00:21:24.975
AS YOU NOW KNOW, I DID
SOMETHING REALLY FOOLISH,

00:21:24.975 --> 00:21:27.275
AND AS A RESULT,
I LOST A FRIEND.

00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:31.375
THAT’S WHY I DON’T
EVER WANT YOU TO MAKE
THAT SAME KIND OF MISTAKE.

00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:36.108
REALIZE WHAT’S TRULY
IMPORTANT TO YOU
AND FIGHT FOR IT.

00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:39.608
FIGHT. FOR WHAT’S
TRULY IMPORTANT TO ME...

00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:42.475
I WILL! AND...
THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:45.342
OKAY, MISS RAKER. I WON’T
FORGET WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:47.542
AND SOON, I’M GONNA
FLY AGAIN WITH MY OWN POWER.

00:21:47.542 --> 00:21:50.847
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I’LL
COME BACK AND RETURN
YOUR WINGS TO YOU.

00:21:53.517 --> 00:21:54.750
I PROMISE!

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.650
OKAY! WELL,
BEST OF LUCK,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.517
THANKS A LOT!

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.083
UM...
BY THE WAY...

00:22:04.083 --> 00:22:07.417
THAT FRIEND OF YOURS,
I DON’T THINK THAT YOU’VE
LOST HER JUST YET.

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:09.517
I’M PRETTY SURE SHE’S
ACTUALLY WAITING.

00:22:09.517 --> 00:22:11.350
