00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:18.734

AND DO SOMETHING STUPID,
WE’LL PLAY RIGHT INTO HIS HANDS!

LOOK, I’M ANGRY
ABOUT THIS TOO.
MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN YOU.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:29.234

HIM EVEN BEFORE I DID.

TELL US.

00:07:59.634 --> 00:08:01.801

TO WORRY ABOUT, I PROMISE.

00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:03.634
WITH YOUR POWER,
WE CAN BEAT HIM.

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:06.634

THREATENED YOU WITH...

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:08.601
HE DIDN’T.
HUH?

00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:10.934
HE DIDN’T COME TO ME
AND THREATEN ME.

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.501
I WAS THE ONE
WHO WENT TO NOMI.

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:15.334

TO BE MY PARTNER.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:19.001
I SAID IF HE SHARED
HIS POINTS WITH ME,
I’D BE HIS HEALER.

00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:20.501
NO WAY...

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.401

SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:26.367

DID HE PLANT A BUG ON YOU?

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.067
NO. LISTEN.
IT’S TRUE.

00:08:29.067 --> 00:08:32.234

00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:37.367

THIS IS ALL ENTIRELY

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.501

AND MINE ALONE.

00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:41.834
THIS CAN’T BE TRUE...

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:45.934

THAT WE AND NEGA NEBULOUS
STAY OUT OF EACH OTHER’S WAY.

00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:48.967

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:19.101
YOU WANNA
EAT SOMETHING?

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:23.234
I’VE GOT FROZEN PIZZA,
BUT THAT’S ABOUT IT.

00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:25.934
THAT’S FINE.
THANKS.

00:09:25.934 --> 00:09:28.167
IF IT’S TRUE THAT SHE
JUST WANTED TO GET
MORE POINTS...

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:32.667
THEN TEAMING UP WITH
NOMI INSTEAD OF US
WOULD BE THE BETTER MOVE.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:36.401
BUT THIS IS CHIYU. SHE’S NOT
SMART LIKE THAT WITH GAMES.
COMPUTER: <i>HEATING STARTED.</i>

00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.634

PLAYER THAT COULD EVEN LOSE

DURING A SCRIPTED
RPG BATTLE, YA KNOW?

00:09:41.234 --> 00:09:45.001
DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE
SHE WOULD BE THAT
INTERESTED IN POINTS?

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.367
NO.
YOU’RE RIGHT,
SHE WOULDN’T BE.

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:51.234
THOUGHT SO.

00:09:51.234 --> 00:09:52.567
THANKS.

00:09:52.567 --> 00:09:54.001
AND BECAUSE OF THAT...

00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:56.267
I’M SURE THAT IT HAS
TO BE SOMETHING ELSE.

00:09:56.267 --> 00:10:00.534
LIKE MAYBE SHE DECIDED
ON SOME KIND OF WHIM.
OR SHE’S BEING TRICKED.

00:10:00.534 --> 00:10:04.234
YEAH, BUT...
THAT LOOK IN HER
EYES WAS SO SERIOUS.

00:10:04.234 --> 00:10:07.067
ESPECIALLY ABOUT
BEING WITH NOMI...

00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:10.667
HEY. LET’S EAT.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:13.634

THEY TASTE PRETTY NASTY.

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:41.234

00:10:41.234 --> 00:10:42.767
LISTEN, I BELIEVE
IN CHIYU.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.901
BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE
WHAT SHE TOLD US TODAY.

00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:47.167
HARU...

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.067
YOU KNOW I’M RIGHT.

00:10:49.067 --> 00:10:51.934
SHE WOULD NEVER TEAM UP
WITH NOMI JUST BECAUSE
SHE WANTS POINTS.

00:10:51.934 --> 00:10:55.234
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER
REASON, SOMETHING SHE
CAN’T TELL US.

00:10:55.234 --> 00:10:57.201
YEAH, I AGREE,
BUT...

00:10:57.201 --> 00:11:01.367
AND PLUS, EVEN IF SHE
DID VOLUNTARILY TEAM UP
WITH THAT CREEP...

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:04.201
NOTHING GOOD IS
GONNA COME FROM IT.

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:07.367
HE’LL JUST USE HER UP,
AND WHEN HE’S DONE,
THROW HER AWAY.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:08.901
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?!

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:12.034
’COURSE NOT!
BUT COME ON, WHAT
CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

00:11:12.034 --> 00:11:16.401
ISN’T IT OBVIOUS?
WE HAVE TO STOP NOMI BY
DESTROYING DUSK TAKER.

00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:19.634
THEN WE CAN GET OUR
ANSWERS AND KNOW
WHAT’S REALLY GOING ON.

00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:22.101
AND CHIYU CAN
TALK TO US AGAIN.

00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:25.034
AM I WRONG?

00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:28.067
NO, BUT THAT’S NOT GOING
TO BE AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS.

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:32.067
I KNOW THAT THIS MIGHT COME
ACROSS AS WEAK, BUT WE SHOULD
THINK ABOUT THIS CAREFULLY.

00:11:32.067 --> 00:11:35.401
FIRST OFF, HIS NAME
DOESN’T EVEN SHOW UP
ON THE MATCHING LIST.

00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.301
SO EVEN JUST SIMPLY
CHALLENGING NOMI TO A
FIGHT IS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE.

00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:43.101
BUT YOU MANAGED TO CATCH
HIM DURING HIS EXAM. SO
OUR CHANCES AREN’T ZERO.

00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:46.667
AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU
AND I HAVE ONE MAJOR
ADVANTAGE OVER HIM.

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:49.501
WE DO?
AND WHAT’S THAT?
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:53.101
IN ORDER FOR NOMI TO
KEEP DOING SO WELL ON HIS
TESTS AND KENDO MATCHES...

00:11:53.101 --> 00:11:56.434
HE’S GOTTA BE BURNING
THROUGH POINTS AT A
PRETTY FAST RATE.

00:11:56.434 --> 00:11:59.834
HE’S ONLY AT LEVEL 5,
AND HE’S CONSTANTLY USING
THE PHYSICAL COMMANDS.

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:02.767
AND EACH TIME HE
DOES THAT, IT ALWAYS
COSTS HIM 5 POINTS.

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:05.101
HE CAN’T HAVE A WHOLE LOT
OF POINTS LEFT IN RESERVE.

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:08.867
THAT’S TRUE.
AND HE DOESN’T TAKE PART
IN TYPICAL DUELS, EITHER.

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:11.767
HE PROBABLY HAS HARDLY
ANY POINTS TO SPARE.

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:12.601
RIGHT.

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:14.167
SO IF WE BEAT HIM A FEW TIMES,

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.167
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STRIP HIM
OF HIS POINTS ENTIRELY.

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:19.801
YEAH, BUT...THE QUESTION
IS, CAN WE BEAT HIM IN A FIGHT?

00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:25.134
HE NOT ONLY HAS AVIATION
ABILITY, BUT HE PRETTY MUCH HAS
THE HEALING ABILITY NOW TOO.

00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:30.034
YEAH, IT WON’T BE EASY.
BUT THERE IS STILL ONE
WAY THAT WE CAN BEAT HIM.

00:12:30.034 --> 00:12:34.434
TAKU. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF SOMETHING CALLED THE
"INCARNATE SYSTEM"?

00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:36.667
THE WHAT?

00:12:42.565 --> 00:12:44.598
TAKU: THE POWER
OF ONE’S WILL?

00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:48.967
HARU: YEAH. SEE, DUSK
TAKER’S SLICING TECHNIQUE
AND MY SWORD OF LIGHT,

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:53.200
BOTH OF THOSE ARE SUPER SPECIAL
MOVES THAT TAP INTO A BURST
LINKER’S VISUALIZATION POWER,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.067
AND USE IT AS
AN ENERGY SOURCE.

00:12:56.067 --> 00:13:00.934
THAT’S AWESOME.
I CAN’T BELIEVE SKY RAKER
TAUGHT YOU SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:02.867
YOU KNOW...
I GOTTA SAY, HARU,

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:06.200
YOU REALLY HAVE A
WAY OF GETTING OLDER
WOMEN TO LIKE YOU.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.634
THAT’S REALLY THE FIRST
THING YOU WANNA COMMENT ON?

00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:12.934
JOKING ASIDE...
IF I DON’T HAVE THAT
SAME KIND OF POWER,

00:13:12.934 --> 00:13:15.434
THEN I WON’T BE THAT
MUCH HELP TO YOU IN BATTLE.

00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:18.100
BUT STILL, HOW DO I GO
ABOUT GETTING IT?

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.467
MM...

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:24.200
WE GO BACK TO MISS RAKER,
AND ASK FOR HELP?

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.267
BUT ASH ROLLER
WILL BE LIKE:

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:30.567
(ASH ROLLER VOICE) "HEY, HEY!
THIS ISN’T A FREAKIN’
CHARITY! BEAT IT CANDY-ASS!"

00:13:30.567 --> 00:13:33.334
OR IF NOT THAT,
THEN SOMETHING CLOSE.

00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:36.467
I NEVER KNEW YOU WERE
SO GOOD AT MIMICKING.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.400
I THINK THERE HAS
TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.134
LET’S JUST GIVE IT A
LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.

00:13:42.134 --> 00:13:45.334
ALL RIGHT. IF I COME
UP WITH SOMETHING,
I’LL LET YOU KNOW.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:49.400
AND HEY, SORRY ABOUT
MAKING YOU MISS
KENDO PRACTICE.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.734
IT’S ALL GOOD.
BYE.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.034
(QUIET BREATH)

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.334
WHAT CAME OVER
ME BACK THERE?

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:59.800
AND THAT VOICE...

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:07.334
WHATEVER IT WAS...
IT CAME FROM MY HEART.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.867
SENPAI!
PLEASE!
WAIT FOR ME!

00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:15.900
UGH!
UGH!

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.567
IS IT BECAUSE I’VE
LOST MY WINGS?

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:19.967
IS THAT WHY
YOU’RE LEAVING ME?

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:23.000
YOU’RE SAYING
THAT YOU DON’T
NEED ME ANY MORE?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.134
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN WINGS?

00:14:31.034 --> 00:14:35.700
SO. JUST ’CAUSE YOU HAVE
THOSE WINGS...YOU’RE GONNA
FLY OFF AND LEAVE ME?!

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:40.500
WELL. NOW YOU
CAN’T GO ANYWHERE.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.200
YOU’LL BE LOCKED AWAY
FOREVER. DEEP IN THE
DEPTHS OF DARKNESS.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.800
HERE...
WITH ME...

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.800
THAT’S RIGHT.
YOU’RE JUST LIKE ME NOW!

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800
(SCREAMING, PANTING)

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.767
IN THAT DREAM, I WAS...

00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:57.467
THAT’S WRONG!
THAT’S NOT WHAT I REALLY WANT!

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:00.200
THE ONLY THING I WANT
IS TO BE WITH HER...

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.134

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.434
SENPAI!

00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:28.334
YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED ME.

00:15:28.334 --> 00:15:31.000
SO, WHY ARE YOU
ACTING SO SURPRISED?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.034
OH, UH, HI.
GOOD MORNING,
SENPAI. I’M SORRY.

00:15:34.034 --> 00:15:36.600
I GUESS I JUST DIDN’T
THINK THAT YOU
WOULD ANSWER.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.567
ACTUALLY, I JUST
WOKE UP AND WAS THINKING
ABOUT GOING BACK TO SLEEP.

00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.967
BUT REGARDLESS,
THIS PLACE, IT’S A
LITTLE ON THE DREARY SIDE.

00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:45.167
MAY I CHANGE IT?

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:46.800
Y-YEAH, SURE.

00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:53.067
(GASPS)

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:54.767
I BOUGHT THIS
YESTERDAY.

00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:58.000
THE COLOR SEEMS
A LITTLE BIT OFF
FROM THE DEMO, THOUGH.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.600
IT’S FINE.
LET’S SIT DOWN
AND CHAT.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.334
LISTEN. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST
JUST SITTING HERE AND WATCHING
THE SCENERY WITH YOU, BUT...

00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:12.400
IS THAT REALLY WHY
YOU CALLED ME?

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.100
NO, YOU’RE RIGHT.
I’M SORRY.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.834
IT’S FINE.
THERE’S NO NEED
TO APOLOGIZE.

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:19.700
I JUST SIMPLY ASSUMED
THAT IT WAS SOMETHING URGENT.

00:16:27.267 --> 00:16:32.067
ACTUALLY, I WAS
JUST...LONELY.

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:36.367
NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE
YOU...BEING SO FAR APART
FOR ALL THIS TIME.

00:16:36.367 --> 00:16:39.200
IT’S REALLY BEEN
SUPER HARD FOR ME.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.600
FOR ME TOO.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.200
I MISS YOU SO
MUCH, HARUYUKI.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.067
IT’S ODD...IN THE PAST,
I’VE SPENT DAYS, EVEN WEEKS

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:51.167
INSIDE THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:55.867
AND NONE OF THEM FELT AS LONG AS
THE ONE SHORT WEEK I WAS APART
FROM YOU IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:16:55.867 --> 00:16:57.567
ME TOO, SENPAI.

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:06.934
SENPAI...

00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:11.200
WE’RE...GONNA BE ABLE
TO SEE EACH OTHER
AGAIN SOON, RIGHT?

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:20.034
YES. IN THREE MORE DAYS.

00:17:20.034 --> 00:17:22.067
TAKU: HARU, I DID
SOME RESEARCH.

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:26.000
BUT IT SEEMS THE INCARNATE
SYSTEM IS PRETTY MUCH
A TOP-SECRET TECHNIQUE.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.300
HARU: WELL, YEAH,
OF COURSE.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.600
THAT REALLY DOESN’T SURPRISE ME.
YOU WOULDN’T SHARE SOMETHING
THAT AMAZING WITH JUST ANYBODY.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.300
TAKU: YEAH.
AND I DON’T
THINK MISS RAKER

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.167
IS THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS ABOUT IT.

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:39.467
HARU: NO, PROBABLY NOT.
I MEAN, EVEN ASH ROLLER
KNOWS IT EXISTS.

00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:43.400
TAKU: SO THERE’S A PRETTY
GOOD CHANCE THEN THAT A KING
WOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.367
THAT GOES FOR
OUR MASTER, TOO.

00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:46.600
HARU: WELL, SHE’S
NEVER MENTIONED IT.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.534
AND WE CAN’T
ASK HER NOW.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.900
IF WE DID, SHE’D
KNOW SOMETHING
WAS UP FOR SURE.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.967
TAKU: I DON’T
KNOW, IN THIS CASE,
TELLING HER MIGHT BE--

00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:56.667
HARU: NO. IF
SHE KNEW, SHE’D
DEFINITELY COME BACK.

00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:59.334
AND SHE’D DESTROY
NOMI AND CHIYU.

00:17:59.334 --> 00:18:01.234
TAKU: (SIGHS)
YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:18:01.234 --> 00:18:03.800
SO MAYBE ANOTHER
KING, THEN.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:04.867
HARU:
YEAH, MAYBE.

00:18:04.867 --> 00:18:07.934
WE JUST GOTTA ASK
ONE OF THE SEVEN.

00:18:07.934 --> 00:18:09.500
WAIT, I KNOW WHO
WE SHOULD ASK.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.534
THE ONE IN
NORTH SUGINAMI!

00:18:11.534 --> 00:18:14.667
TAKU: YOU’RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT
SCARLET RAIN?

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:17.800
HARU: YEAH. WHY NOT?
I’M SURE NIKO WOULD
KNOW ABOUT IT.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.667
OH!

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:21.867
(GASPS)

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.134
THANK YOU.

00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:31.934
TAKU: HARU,
WHAT IS IT?

00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:36.434
HARU:
IT’S CHIYU.

00:18:36.434 --> 00:18:38.134
HEY.

00:18:38.134 --> 00:18:39.467
MORNING.

00:18:46.934 --> 00:18:48.200
CHIYU...

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.034
TAKU: I SEE.

00:18:52.034 --> 00:18:55.000
SO OUR GUESS YESTERDAY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WAS PROBABLY RIGHT.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.400
HARU: YEAH, BUT WE CAN’T
KEEP GOING AROUND
MOPING ABOUT IT.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.734
I’M THINKING IT’S BEST
IF WE GO TO NERIMA
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY.

00:19:00.734 --> 00:19:02.534
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
YOU SKIP PRACTICE?

00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:06.134

00:19:19.434 --> 00:19:24.534

00:19:24.534 --> 00:19:27.300

I, UH...

00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:41.800
YEAH?
GO ON.
YOU CAN TELL ME.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.267
ON SUNDAY THE 14TH, I CAME TO
SCHOOL TO MEET UP WITH A FRIEND
OF MINE WHO’S IN THE KENDO CLUB.

00:19:47.267 --> 00:19:48.834
