Megumi: BACK WHEN I
WAS A LITTLE KID,

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.642
THERE WAS A BOOK
I WAS TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH.

00:06:10.642 --> 00:06:12.275
IN THE WORLD
THAT BOOK CREATED,

00:06:12.275 --> 00:06:14.542
THERE WERE ALWAYS
NEW PEOPLE TO MEET,

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:15.808
AND ADVENTURE TO BE HAD.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.408
I READ THAT BOOK
EVERY DAY,

00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:20.408
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:21.408
I NEVER GOT TIRED OF IT.

00:06:21.408 --> 00:06:22.675
BUT THEN ONE DAY,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:23.775
THE BOOK DISAPPEARED.

00:06:23.775 --> 00:06:25.542
AND NOW I CAN’T REMEMBER

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:26.575
WHAT THE BOOK WAS CALLED

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:28.075
OR WHAT IT WAS EVEN ABOUT.

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.042
I JUST REMEMBER
THERE WAS A SPELL

00:06:30.042 --> 00:06:31.075
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE BOOK

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:32.508
THAT YOU HAD TO SAY OUT LOUD

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:33.642
IN ORDER TO START READING IT.

00:06:33.642 --> 00:06:34.908
AND I KNOW THAT...

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:37.175
UNLESS I’M ABLE
TO REMEMBER THAT SPELL,

00:06:37.175 --> 00:06:40.342

FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD?

THAT YOU WOULD SLIP AWAY TO?

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:49.642
MAYBE THAT’S WHY...

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.675
I JOINED THE LITERARY CLUB
AT SCHOOL.

00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:53.275
I WAS THINKING IT
WOULD BE A WAY FOR ME

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:55.642
TO RECREATE THAT STORY
ALL ON MY OWN.

00:06:55.642 --> 00:06:56.842
AND HOW’S THAT GOING?

00:06:56.842 --> 00:06:58.775

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:13.542
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T
NEED TO BUY ANYONE A SOUVENIR?

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:14.642
YEAH, I’M SURE.

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.075
I DON’T HAVE
A SPECIAL SOMEONE

00:07:16.075 --> 00:07:17.742

00:07:17.742 --> 00:07:19.975

00:07:19.975 --> 00:07:21.975
I SEE.
WELL, THEN...

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.408
I KNOW.
LET’S DO THIS:

00:07:24.408 --> 00:07:27.175
YOU AND ME,
WE’LL BUY A LITTLE SOUVENIR

00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:28.875
FOR EACH OTHER
DURING THIS TRIP.

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.375
AND THEN ONCE WE’RE
BACK AT SCHOOL,

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:31.408
WE CAN EXCHANGE OUR GIFTS.

00:07:31.408 --> 00:07:33.475
YOU MEAN LIKE
A SURPRISE PRESENT?

00:07:33.475 --> 00:07:34.808
I WASN’T EXPECTING YOU

00:07:34.808 --> 00:07:36.608
TO COME UP
WITH SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

00:07:36.608 --> 00:07:37.942
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:07:37.942 --> 00:07:39.708
NOTHING.
LISTEN,

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.275
THIS MEANS WE’VE
GOTTA SPLIT UP.

00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:43.308
THERE’S NO WAY WE CAN DO THIS
IF WE SHOP TOGETHER.

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:45.675
OKAY, THEN.
LET’S DO OUR OWN THING

00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:47.642
FOR, LIKE, 30 MINUTES.

00:07:47.642 --> 00:07:49.175
THEN, WE CAN MEET UP AGAIN

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:51.008
AT THE HOTEL ENTRANCE
AT 4:00.

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:53.475
SURE. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I’LL SEE YOU THEN.

00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:56.208
I’M GONNA FIND SOMETHING
THAT’LL BE THE BIGGEST SURPRISE

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:58.775

00:08:16.008 --> 00:08:18.842
IS THIS THE OLD
CASTLE STAGE?

00:08:18.842 --> 00:08:21.075
IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:23.608
MAYBE THIS IS HOW
IT LOOKS IN OKINAWA.

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:26.142

IT’S NOT THE OLD CASTLE!

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:30.308
THIS IS THE GUSUKU STAGE!

00:08:30.308 --> 00:08:32.542
( grunts )
( whimpers )
RUKA...

00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:34.142
W-WAIT FOR ME!

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:39.075
( yelps )

00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:43.442
Kuroyukihime: HMM.

00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:45.442
YOU MUST BE ONE
OF THOSE SCHOOL TRIP KIDS

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:46.908
STAYING AT THE HOTEL.

00:08:46.908 --> 00:08:48.442
AND YOU TWO ARE BURST LINKERS

00:08:48.442 --> 00:08:50.808
WHO HAPPEN TO BE LOCALS
FROM THIS AREA?

00:08:50.808 --> 00:08:53.108
ATTEEMEE--I MEAN,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:55.908
MY FAMILY’S BEEN IN UCHINANCHU
FOR GENERATIONS.

00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:57.275
YEP, MINE, TOO.

00:08:57.275 --> 00:08:58.375
WELL, PRETTY MUCH.

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:00.675
I’VE GOTTA SAY,
I’M SURPRISED.

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:02.475
A LOCAL BURST LINKER.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.808
AND NOT JUST ONE.

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:06.575
VERY INTERESTING.

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:08.408
AH, YOU’RE UP FOR IT.

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:09.875
OKAY, ME AND YOU.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:10.942
LET’S DO IT!

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:12.275
( whimpers )
ALL RIGHT, RUKA.

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:14.175
BE CAREFUL.
SHE’S LEVEL NINE.

00:09:14.175 --> 00:09:15.908
( chuckles )
THAT MEANS NOTHIN’.

00:09:15.908 --> 00:09:18.475
SHE’S ONLY TWO LEVELS HIGHER
THAN OUR MASTER.

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.375
( yelling )

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:22.308
( grunting )

00:09:23.775 --> 00:09:26.075
( grunting )

00:09:26.075 --> 00:09:28.375
( grunts, groans )

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.308
( gasps )

00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:32.275
( grunts )

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:34.908
( yelling )

00:09:35.842 --> 00:09:37.342
( yelling )

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:41.208
Ruka:
YUKUSHIASSA!

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.675
SHE CREATED A HUGE HOLE
IN THE CENTER
OF THE BATTLEFIELD.

00:09:44.675 --> 00:09:46.475
THAT’S ENOUGH, RUKA.

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:48.808
LET’S JUST ASK HER ALREADY.

00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:51.175
NOT YET!
AN UCHINAA WARRIOR

00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:53.742
CAN’T LOSE TO SOME SAMURAI
FROM YAMATO!

00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:56.808
TIDAL WAVE!

00:09:56.808 --> 00:09:58.075
DEATH BY...

00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.075
( yelling )
BARRAGING!

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:03.475
( grunts, yells )

00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:04.442
( Kuroyukihime grunts )

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:10.242
( grunts )

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:11.908
( panting )

00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:16.675
( grunts )

00:10:16.675 --> 00:10:17.875
YOU WIN.

00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:19.875
MMM. YOU FOUGHT QUITE WELL.

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:22.342
YOUR FEINT AND KICK
WERE ESPECIALLY GOOD.

00:10:22.342 --> 00:10:24.775
IT’LL BE EVEN BETTER IF YOU
CAN MAKE THE TRANSITION

00:10:24.775 --> 00:10:25.842
MORE SEAMLESS.

00:10:25.842 --> 00:10:27.808
GOT IT, NEE-NEE.

00:10:27.808 --> 00:10:29.108
I’LL WORK ON THAT.

00:10:29.108 --> 00:10:30.508
( whimpers )
W-WAIT, RUKA.

00:10:30.508 --> 00:10:33.008
WE HAVEN’T TALKED ABOUT
WHAT WE CAME FOR.

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.942
I...I FORGOT
ALL ABOUT THAT.

00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:38.075
NEE-NEE, WE NEED SOMEONE
AS GOOD AS YOU

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:39.308
TO DO US A FAVOR.

00:10:39.308 --> 00:10:41.908
WOULD YOU AT LEAST
HEAR US OUT?

00:10:41.908 --> 00:10:44.675
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I CAN CERTAINLY LISTEN

00:10:44.675 --> 00:10:46.342
TO WHAT THAT MAY BE.

00:10:46.342 --> 00:10:48.008
Both: NIFEE DEEBIRU!

00:10:48.008 --> 00:10:50.542
ALL RIGHT, UM,
LET’S SEE...

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:52.775
THERE’S A COFFEE SHOP
CLOSE BY CALLED SABANI.

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:54.708
IT’S AT THE END
OF THIS MAIN STREET.

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:56.342
SO WHY DON’T WE
LOG OUT AND MEET UP

00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:58.075
AT ONE OF THOSE TABLES THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES?

00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:00.275
HUH? W-WAIT A SECOND.

00:11:00.275 --> 00:11:01.475
( grunts )

00:11:04.508 --> 00:11:05.775
( whimpers )

00:11:06.808 --> 00:11:09.975
WANNA MEET?
IN THE REAL WORLD?

00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:20.461
Both: WHOA.

00:11:22.961 --> 00:11:24.228
( grunts )

00:11:25.428 --> 00:11:28.228
I BELIEVE IT WAS YOU TWO
WHO INVITED ME HERE,

00:11:28.228 --> 00:11:29.495
SO LET’S HEAR IT.

00:11:29.495 --> 00:11:30.695
( both gasp )

00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:31.995
WASSAIBIIN.

00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:33.261
IT’S JUST--I DIDN’T KNOW

00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:34.961
YOU’D BE A MAJOR CHURAKAGI

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:36.095
( giggles )

00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.961
Mana:
"CHURAKAGI" MEANS BEAUTY.

00:11:37.961 --> 00:11:39.695
SHE THINKS YOU’RE
REALLY PRETTY.

00:11:39.695 --> 00:11:41.628
OKAY, MY NAME IS...

00:11:41.628 --> 00:11:43.628
RUKA ASATO FROM CLASS 2-2

00:11:43.628 --> 00:11:44.928
AT KUBE JUNIOR HIGH.

00:11:44.928 --> 00:11:46.561
( gasps )
AND I’M MANA ITOSU

00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.695
FROM CLASS 1-3.

00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:49.495
I ALSO GO TO THAT
SAME SCHOOL.

00:11:49.495 --> 00:11:51.428
Both: IT’S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:52.561
( coughs )

00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:55.128
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:11:55.128 --> 00:11:56.961
THOSE NAMES YOU TWO
JUST GAVE ME,

00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:58.161
ARE THEY YOUR REAL NAMES?

00:11:58.161 --> 00:12:00.028
WELL YEAH,
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:01.295
( sighs )

00:12:01.295 --> 00:12:02.361
AMAZING.

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:04.095
WHEN YOU SAID
TO MEET YOU GUYS

00:12:04.095 --> 00:12:05.761
IN THE REAL WORLD,
I WAS AFRAID I’D

00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:07.361
BE WALKING INTO SOME SORT
OF TRAP.

00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:09.161
I DON’T GET IT.
WHAT’S THE MATTER?

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:10.895
IT’S JUST...

00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:12.528
LOOK, THIS MASTER OF YOURS,

00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:14.228
WHEN THEY GAVE YOU
<i>BRAIN BURST,</i>

00:12:14.228 --> 00:12:16.228
DIDN’T THEY TEACH YOU
ANY SPECIFIC RULES

00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:17.828
THAT COME ALONG WITH IT?

00:12:17.828 --> 00:12:19.628
( both gasp )

00:12:19.628 --> 00:12:20.695
Both: AND...GO!

00:12:20.695 --> 00:12:22.028
Both: RULE ONE--

00:12:22.028 --> 00:12:24.295
DON’T USE ACCELERATION
FOR ANYTHING BAD.

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:26.895
AND RULE TWO--
DON’T TALK ABOUT ACCELERATING

00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:28.395
TO JUST ANYONE.

00:12:28.395 --> 00:12:29.695
END OF RULES.

00:12:29.695 --> 00:12:31.428
AND THAT WAS ALL?

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:33.528
Both:
YEP. THAT WAS IT.

00:12:33.528 --> 00:12:34.528
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:36.328
THIS SO-CALLED
MASTER OF YOURS--

00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:38.495
I THINK I MIGHT NEED
TO HAVE A WORD WITH THEM.

00:12:38.495 --> 00:12:40.828
Both: REALLY?
NEE-NEE, THAT’D BE SO GREAT!

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:43.228
URISSAN!
WE’VE BEEN RACKING
OUR BRAINS

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:45.095
TO COME UP WITH A WAY
TO GET YOU TO DO THAT.

00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:47.095
HUH? DO WHAT?

00:12:47.095 --> 00:12:48.895
THE WHOLE REASON
WE ASKED YOU HERE IN PERSON

00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:50.795
IS ’CAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU’D BE WILLING

00:12:50.795 --> 00:12:52.261
TO MEET OUR MASTER.

00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:54.061
( sighs )

00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:56.128
( indistinct chattering )

00:12:57.195 --> 00:12:58.461
( grunts softly )

00:12:58.461 --> 00:12:59.495
( chuckles )

00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:03.028
Kuroyukihime:
<i>SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT...</i>

00:13:03.028 --> 00:13:04.761
RUKAT’S THE PROTEGE
OF A BURST LINKER

00:13:04.761 --> 00:13:06.095
WHO MOVED HERE FROM TOKYO,

00:13:06.095 --> 00:13:08.161
AND MANA IS RUKA’S PROTEGE?

00:13:08.161 --> 00:13:10.795
RIGHT. SEE, THERE’S
ONLY THREE OF US RIGHT NOW.

00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:12.528
BUT WE WANNA
EXPAND OUR CIRCLE

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:13.828
SO THAT ONE DAY,

00:13:13.828 --> 00:13:17.028
OUR ACCELERATED COMMUNITY
IS BIGGER THAN TOKYO’S.

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:18.661
AIAIBIIN.

00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:21.361
BUT YOU SEE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED RECENTLY

00:13:21.361 --> 00:13:22.661
THAT JUST MIGHT
RUIN ALL THAT.

00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.695
FIRST OUR MASTER
TRIED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:13:24.695 --> 00:13:26.095
TO FACE THE PROBLEM,

00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:28.595
BUT NOW IT SEEMS
HE’S COMPLETELY GIVEN UP.

00:13:28.595 --> 00:13:30.361
WELL WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:32.395
TO BE HONEST,
I DON’T KNOW.

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:35.828
I WISH WE DID,
BUT WE DON’T REALLY
UNDERSTAND IT OURSELVES.

00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:37.261
ALL OUR MASTER TOLD US

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.128
WAS THAT SOME SORT
OF MAJIMUN APPEARED.

00:13:39.128 --> 00:13:41.861
THAT’S WHY WE’RE HERE.
WE NEED SOMEONE
AS STRONG AS YOU

00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:43.361
TO HELP OUT OUR MASTER.

00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:45.095
Both: PLEASE.
WE’RE BEGGING!

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:47.361
YOU CAN BEG ME TO HELP YOU
ALL YOU WANT,

00:13:47.361 --> 00:13:48.961
BUT I CAN’T COMMIT TO ANYTHING

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.261
UNTIL I KNOW A BIT MORE
ABOUT THIS MAJIMUN,

00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:52.728
OKAY?

00:13:52.728 --> 00:13:53.861
( chuckles )

00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:55.095
( both gasp )

00:13:55.095 --> 00:13:56.628
SO I GUESS IF WE
WANT TO FIND OUT MORE,

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.861
THEN THE NEXT STEP
IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS:

00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:00.261
LET’S GO MEET YOUR MASTER!

00:14:00.261 --> 00:14:01.728
( squeals )
YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

00:14:01.728 --> 00:14:04.095
IT’S HAPPENING WHEN YOU
SAID IT WOULD, MANA.

00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:05.461
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:07.761
COME ON!
LET’S GO TO MY HOUSE!

00:14:07.761 --> 00:14:09.528
WAIT. NOT SO FAST.
( both grunt )

00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:12.228
I THINK IT’S BEST IF WE
DON’T DO THIS IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:13.661
IF HE’S FROM TOKYO,

00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.895
THERE’S A CHANCE
WE MAY HAVE CROSSED PATHS

00:14:15.895 --> 00:14:18.095
IN THE ACCELERATED
WORLD BEFORE.

00:14:18.095 --> 00:14:20.461
OH, SO THAT’S WHAT
YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT.

00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:21.628
GOOD POINT.

00:14:21.628 --> 00:14:23.561
IF OUR MASTER WERE TO SEE
WHAT A CHURAKAGI SHE IS,

00:14:23.561 --> 00:14:25.728
THERE’S JUST NOT TELLING
WHAT HE MIGHT DO!

00:14:25.728 --> 00:14:27.828
( sighs )

00:14:27.828 --> 00:14:28.861
( grunts )

00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:30.261
( gasps )

00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:32.928
OH, NO!
( both gasp )

00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:38.928
( chuckles )

00:14:38.928 --> 00:14:40.961
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
( panting )

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.728
SORRY I’M LATE.

00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:43.928
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:45.928
I JUST MADE IT
BACK HERE MYSELF.

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.528
I HAD A HARD TIME DECIDING,

00:14:47.528 --> 00:14:48.428
AND KNOWING YOU...

00:14:48.428 --> 00:14:50.095
WERE HAVING JUST AS HARD
OF A TIME

00:14:50.095 --> 00:14:51.361
FINDING THE PERFECT
THING FOR ME.

00:14:51.361 --> 00:14:52.795
WELL, THAT MADE ME HAPPY.

00:14:52.795 --> 00:14:54.061
TIME FLEW BY.

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:56.328
( grunts softly )
I’M SORRY, MEGUMI,

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.295
BUT I...

00:14:57.295 --> 00:14:59.828
FORGOT ALL ABOUT
YOUR PRESENT.

00:14:59.828 --> 00:15:01.228
( sighs )

00:15:01.228 --> 00:15:04.228
NO, THAT’S FINE.
THE TRIP’S NOT OVER YET.

00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:06.661
YOU STILL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME LEFT

00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:08.828
TO FIND ME SOMETHING
IF YOU WANT TO.

00:15:08.828 --> 00:15:11.095
I KNOW, BUT I PROMISED YOU.

00:15:11.095 --> 00:15:12.728
( voice breaking )
REALLY, IT’S FINE.

00:15:12.728 --> 00:15:13.895
I MEAN IT.

00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:16.061
( grunts softly )

00:15:16.061 --> 00:15:18.595
OH, NO. I-I REALLY
DIDN’T MEAN TO.

00:15:18.595 --> 00:15:21.861
IT’S ODD--I DON’T KNOW
WHY I’M CRYING.

00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.295
MEGUMI.

00:15:23.295 --> 00:15:26.228
I’M SORRY, BUT CAN YOU
JUST GO ON AHEAD WITHOUT ME?

00:15:26.228 --> 00:15:29.428
I’M GOING BACK TO THE ROOM
TO LIE DOWN FOR A BIT.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.528
MEGUMI, WAIT!

00:15:33.228 --> 00:15:34.028
♪

00:15:34.028 --> 00:15:35.361
I’M SORRY, MEGUMI.

00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:37.995
THERE’S NO EXCUSE
FOR WHAT I DID.

00:15:37.995 --> 00:15:39.761
IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT.

00:15:39.761 --> 00:15:41.661
I JUST GOT WAY TOO EXCITED

00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:43.361
AND THEN MADE A FOOL
OF MYSELF.

00:15:43.361 --> 00:15:45.595
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:47.095
YOU KNOW WHAT, HIME?

00:15:47.095 --> 00:15:49.861
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
FOR A HALF AN HOUR OR SO,

00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:52.395
AND I’LL BE BACK TO MY
OLD SELF AGAIN.

00:15:52.395 --> 00:15:53.228
I PROMISE.

00:15:53.228 --> 00:15:55.861
MEGUMI, I’LL CONFESS.

00:15:55.861 --> 00:15:59.095
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER TODAY
ON THE BEACH IS TRUE.

00:15:59.095 --> 00:16:00.228
THAT OTHER WORLD--

00:16:00.228 --> 00:16:02.261
IT IS A PLACE I ESCAPE TO.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.161
AND THE WAY
THAT TIME WORKS THERE--

00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:05.761
WELL, IT’S DIFFERENT.

00:16:05.761 --> 00:16:08.895
MY VERY FIRST FORAY
INTO THAT WORLD
WAS SEVEN YEARS AGO.

00:16:08.895 --> 00:16:12.095
AND SINCE THEN,
I’VE SPENT A GREAT DEAL
OF TIME THERE.

00:16:12.095 --> 00:16:14.761
TRUTH IS, I’VE SPENT SO MUCH
TIME IN THAT WORLD

00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:16.095
THAT NOW I’M NO LONGER SURE

00:16:16.095 --> 00:16:18.095
WHICH WORLD IS THE REAL ONE.

00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:19.928
<i>AND BECAUSE OF THAT,</i>

00:16:19.928 --> 00:16:22.928
<i>I’M NOT EVEN SURE WHICH WORLD</i>
<i>I REALLY BELONG IN ANYMORE.</i>

00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:26.361
<i>IT’S MADE ME START ASKING</i>
<i>QUESTIONS ABOUT MY LIFE--</i>

00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.895
<i>LIKE, "WHAT PURPOSE IS THERE</i>
<i>FOR ME TO EVEN EXIST?"</i>

00:16:28.895 --> 00:16:32.195
<i>BUT WHENEVER I’VE COME CLOSE</i>
<i>TO LOSING MYSELF,</i>

00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:34.495
YOU’VE ALWAYS
BEEN THE ONE TO SAVE ME.

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:36.695
EVER SINCE OUR FIRST
DAY AT SCHOOL,

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:39.995
WHEN YOU CAME OVER
AND INVITED ME
TO HAVE LUNCH WITH YOU,

00:16:39.995 --> 00:16:41.761
YOU HAVE BEEN THE ONLY PERSON

00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:44.361
WHO HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP ME
GROUNDED IN THE REAL WORLD,

00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:46.395
ESPECIALLY
WHEN I NEED IT MOST.

00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:50.028
I’VE LET MYSELF
LOSE SEVERAL CLOSE TIES

00:16:50.028 --> 00:16:51.528
IN THAT OTHER WORLD.

00:16:51.528 --> 00:16:54.828
BUT NOW I’M STARTING
TO GRADUALLY REBUILD THEM.

00:16:54.828 --> 00:16:57.395
HOWEVER, IN THIS WORLD,
MEGUMI,

00:16:57.395 --> 00:16:59.561
THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE
IS YOU.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:00.728
THAT’S IT.

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:02.395
( crying )
HIME.

00:17:03.661 --> 00:17:05.095
MEGUMI.

00:17:05.095 --> 00:17:06.495
THANK YOU.

00:17:06.495 --> 00:17:08.828
WHAT YOU JUST SAID
MAKES ME SO HAPPY.

00:17:08.828 --> 00:17:11.328
BUT STILL,
I’M REALLY SORRY.

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.795
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:16.861
I WAS THE ONE WHO
FORGOT ABOUT BUYING A GIFT.

00:17:16.861 --> 00:17:18.628
NO, I-IT’S NOT THAT.

00:17:18.628 --> 00:17:21.228
YOU SEE, THERE’S SOMETHING
YOU DON’T KNOW,

00:17:21.228 --> 00:17:24.161
SOMETHING I SHOULD’VE
APOLOGIZED FOR A LONG TIME AGO.

00:17:24.161 --> 00:17:25.761
HIME, BACK THEN, I...

WITHOUT SOME SORT OF

WHOA.

00:18:56.961 --> 00:18:59.661
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO IF YOU COULDN’T
MAKE IT BACK TO A PORTAL?

00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:01.695
( whimpers )
THERE’S NO NEED
TO STRESS ABOUT THAT.

00:19:01.695 --> 00:19:03.061
YEAH. NANKURUNAISA.

00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:04.628
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,
THEN THE WAITRESS

00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:07.428
WOULD JUST EVENTUALLY COME BY

AND THAT’S PRECISELY
WHAT I’LL DO.

00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.928

SOMEONE WHO CAN REALLY
HELP US.

00:20:58.928 --> 00:21:02.428
WHAT? YOU WERE SERIOUS ABOUT
GETTING AN OUTSIDER TO HELP US?

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.628
WHAT’S THE POINT?
IT’S USELESS.

00:21:04.628 --> 00:21:06.661
WE’RE SCREWED.
WE’RE SCREWED!

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:07.861
WE’RE SCREWED.

HELPING OUT

NAH. I BET EVEN A KING

00:21:34.128 --> 00:21:36.028
WOULD HAVE TROUBLE
GOING UP AGAINST THAT THING.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.128

STOP BARKIN’ AT ME!

00:21:45.228 --> 00:21:47.395

COULD PULL OFF A MIRACLE
