♪

00:02:38.698 --> 00:02:41.598

NOT HERE TODAY.

AAH!

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:53.031
SO, HARUYUKI.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.231
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE THREE
REACH A NEW LEVEL TOGETHER?

00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:58.965
AAH!

00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:00.365
AAH!

I’M SO GONNA BURN IN HELL.

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:18.165
I’M SO ASHAMED.
OH, I’M PATHETIC.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.831
IF I HADN’T CABLE-LINKED
WITH CHIYU,

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:21.331
I NEVER WOULD’VE
HAD THAT DREAM!

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.031
Kuroyukihime:
GOOD MORNING,
YOUNG MAN.

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:24.198
AAH!

00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:25.398
INTERESTING.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:27.031
THIS HOW YOU
ALWAYS GREET
PEOPLE?

00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:28.598
NO! OF COURSE NOT!

00:03:28.598 --> 00:03:31.398
G-GOOD MORNING.
HOW ARE YOU?!

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:32.731
MM...

00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:35.431
LISTEN...
BY THE WAY...

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:37.531
ABOUT YESTERDAY...

00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.998
I APOLOGIZE.

00:03:38.998 --> 00:03:40.565
I BEHAVED
IMMATURELY.

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:43.765
AAH! NO!
I’M THE ONE
WHO’S SORRY.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.031
I DIDN’T MEAN
TO HAVE THAT DREAM.

00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:46.831
WHAT DREAM?

00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.798
NOTHING!
NOT THE DREAM!

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:51.431
I MEANT, FOR LEAVING
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.365
THAT WAS RUDE.
( chuckles )

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:54.898
I DON’T BLAME YOU.

00:03:54.898 --> 00:03:57.398
AFTER ALL,
FIRST I ACCUSED
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

00:03:57.398 --> 00:04:00.598
AND THEN I TASKED YOU
WITH A CHALLENGE THAT
WAS SURELY IMPOSSIBLE:

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:02.365
GETTING HER
TO CABLE-LINK
WITH YOU.

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:05.531
UH, ACTUALLY...
I GOT HER TO DO IT.

00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.531
DO WHAT?

00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:08.965
WE CABLE-LINKED.

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:14.231
WHERE WAS THIS?

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.031
IT WAS...
AT HER HOUSE.

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:18.565
IN WHICH ROOM?

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:21.331
WELL, WE WERE IN HER...
BEDROOM.

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.931
OH?

00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:24.898
I WAS ABLE TO HACK IN
AND CHECK HER MEMORY
FOR ANY EVIDENCE--

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:26.665
AND HOW LONG
WAS THIS CABLE?

00:04:26.665 --> 00:04:29.798
UH...
THIRTY CENTIMETERS...
OR SO.

00:04:29.798 --> 00:04:31.031
HMM!

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:37.565
( gasping, panting )

00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:41.565
( school bell chiming )

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:44.131
Haru voice over: <i>WHY DID SHE</i>
<i>JUST STORM OFF LIKE THAT?</i>

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:45.531
( sighs )

00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:46.965
<i>I NEED TO TALK TO HER.</i>

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:48.565
<i>I HAVE TO TELL HER</i>
<i>WHAT I FOUND OUT.</i>

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.131
HELLO!
AAH!

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:52.965
SO, YOU’RE HARUYUKI ARITA
FROM CLASS 1-C, AREN’T YOU?

00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:54.698
WE’RE WITH
<i>UMESATO TIMES.</i>

00:04:54.698 --> 00:04:56.998
THE GOSSIP COLUMN
FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER.

00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:57.831
WE WRITE THAT!

00:04:57.831 --> 00:04:59.298
OKAY,
FIRST QUESTION:

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:00.698
ARE THE
RUMORS TRUE?

00:05:00.698 --> 00:05:02.431
ARE YOU
REALLY DATING
KUROYUKIHIME?

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:03.765
AAH!
THAT’S A LIE!

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:04.931
THAT’S
TOTALLY FALSE!

00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:06.765
BUT ACCORDING
TO OUR SOURCES,

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.965
YOU’VE CABLE-LINKED
WITH HER TWICE IN
THE STUDENT LOUNGE.

00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:10.698
AND THEN ONE MORE TIME
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL

00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:13.031
AT A NEARBY
COFFEE SHOP!

00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:18.231
YEAH. I...WAS JUST HELPING...
HER FIX HER NEURO-LINKER...

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:20.465
IT’S NOTHING MORE
INTERESTING THAN THAT.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:23.065
AND THEN SHE TOOK ME
TO A COFFEE SHOP
TO SAY THANK YOU.

00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:24.265
THAT’S IT!

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:26.665
LOOK...YOU CAN TELL
SHE DOESN’T LIKE ME

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:28.765
BY THE WAY SHE ACTS
WHENEVER WE’RE TOGETHER.

00:05:28.765 --> 00:05:30.831
I MEAN, BY THE END
OF ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS,

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:32.198
SHE’S ALWAYS
IN A BAD MOOD.

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.698
REALLY?

00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:36.265
YEAH, SHE WENT AND STORMED OFF
AGAIN THIS MORNING.

00:05:36.265 --> 00:05:37.831
IT’S...WEIRD.

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:39.631
EVERY TIME I BRING UP
CHIYU’S NAME, SHE JUST--

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:41.065
CHIYURI
KURASHIMA?

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:42.765
OH, RIGHT,
THAT GIRL.

00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:46.731
THOSE TWO GOT INTO
IT BY THE SCHOOL
GATES YESTERDAY.

00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:48.465
SO...
ARE WE DONE HERE?

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:49.665
YEAH,
NOT QUITE.

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.231
WE THOUGHT THE
WHOLE THING
WAS BOGUS.

00:05:51.231 --> 00:05:53.498
BUT NOW, I’M
NOT SO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:55.165
HEY, ARITA.

00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:57.465
I THINK YOU’RE WRONG
ABOUT KUROYUKIHIME.

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.831
SHE MIGHT
LIKE YOU
FOR REAL.

00:05:58.831 --> 00:05:59.698
AAH!

00:05:59.698 --> 00:06:01.331
I MEAN,
COME ON.

00:06:01.331 --> 00:06:02.965
SHE GETS MAD EACH
TIME YOU MENTION
ANOTHER GIRL’S NAME?

00:06:02.965 --> 00:06:04.798
THE ONLY REASON
FOR THAT...

00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:08.065
Both: IS BECAUSE
SHE’S JEALOUS!

00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:09.165
( Haru gasps )

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:12.765
CAN’T BE...

00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:14.131
School Reporters:
<i>SHE’S JEALOUS!</i>

00:06:14.131 --> 00:06:15.198
THERE’S NO WAY!

00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:16.431
IT’S A LIE!
IT’S GOTTA BE!

00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:17.665
THERE’S NO WAY!

00:06:17.665 --> 00:06:20.431
IT JUST CAN’T!

00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:21.631
I DON’T GET IT.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.498
COME ON,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:25.131
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.998
<i>YOU’VE GOT EVERYTHING</i>
<i>YOU COULD EVER WANT.</i>

00:06:28.998 --> 00:06:32.298
<i>THE LOOKS, GRADES, POPULARITY.</i>
<i>ALL OF IT!</i>

00:06:32.298 --> 00:06:34.698
THERE’S NOW WAY YOU’D GO
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME!

00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:36.565
<i>I’M NOT GONNA BELIEVE IT.</i>

00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:39.931
<i>I’M NOT GONNA GET MY HOPES UP</i>
<i>JUST TO HAVE YOU CRUSH THEM.</i>

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:43.231
<i>DAMN IT.</i>
<i>WHY’D YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE ME?</i>

00:06:57.698 --> 00:07:01.431
( background chatter )

00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.698
HEY...

00:07:05.398 --> 00:07:07.431
WHY DON’T WE CHAT
WHILE WE WALK?

00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.031
SURE...

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.965
Kuroyukihime:LISTEN.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS MORNING.

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.165
I DON’T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:19.398
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:21.698
I FOUND A CONNECTION
BETWEEN CHIYURI
AND CYAN PILE.

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.365
HUH? REALLY?
YOU DID?

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:26.265
THEN LET’S CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION
VIA CABLE-LINK.

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:30.098
WE DON’T WANT ANYONE
EAVESDROPPING ON THE
IMPORTANT DETAILS, DO WE?

00:07:30.098 --> 00:07:33.465
OH...I HAD TO REPLACE
MY PREVIOUS CABLE,

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.565
IT JUST SUDDENLY
STOPPED WORKING.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:38.965
ALL THE STORE HAD
WAS THIS SHORT ONE.

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.865
Haru:
<i>CHIYURI’S NOT</i>
<i>CYAN PILE.</i>

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:47.731
<i>SHE’S BEEN HACKED.</i>

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:49.931
<i>SOMEONE SENT A VIRUS</i>
<i>TO HER NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>AND CREATED</i>

00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:52.265
<i>A BACK DOOR</i>
<i>THEY COULD ACCESS.</i>
<i>( Kuroyukihime gasps )</i>

00:07:52.265 --> 00:07:54.465
Haru: <i>THAT’S WHY THEY’RE ABLE</i>
<i>TO LOG ONTO THE SCHOOL’S NET</i>

00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:58.098
<i>AND USE HER COORDINATES</i>
<i>ON CAMPUS TO CHALLENGE YOU.</i>

00:07:58.098 --> 00:08:00.498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>WHAT’S THE MATTER?</i>
<i>IS SOMETHING WRONG?</i>

00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:01.965
<i>YOU’RE ACTING STRANGE.</i>

00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:03.831
Haru: <i>I’M FINE.</i>
<i>DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.</i>

00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:05.831
Kuroyukihime:
<i>DID SOMETHING HAPPEN</i>
<i>AT SCHOOL TODAY?</i>

00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:07.765
Haru: <i>I SAID</i>
<i>DON’T WORRY</i>
<i>ABOUT IT.</i>

00:08:07.765 --> 00:08:09.431
<i>LET’S TALK ABOUT</i>
<i>WHAT’S IMPORTANT.</i>

00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.498
<i>DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF</i>
<i>OF THIS HACK?</i>

00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:14.698
<i>NO. I FIGURED THAT</i>
<i>WHOEVER IT WAS WOULD</i>
<i>NOTICE IF I DID ANYTHING.</i>

00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:16.165
<i>SO I LET IT BE.</i>

00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:17.665
Kuroyukihime:
<i>THAT’S A LOGICAL RESPONSE,</i>

00:08:17.665 --> 00:08:19.431
<i>BUT IT MAKES IT</i>
<i>VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.</i>

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:22.431
<i>REMEMBER, BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>IS CONSIDERED AN</i>
<i>UN-HACKABLE PROGRAM.</i>

00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:26.731
<i>CONNECTING TO ITS MATCHING</i>
<i>SERVER THROUGH A BACKDOOR</i>
<i>IS UNHEARD OF. EVEN BY ME.</i>

00:08:26.731 --> 00:08:28.165
<i>SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?</i>

00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:29.865
<i>THAT I’VE JUST</i>
<i>MADE ALL THIS UP?</i>

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:31.665
<i>SOME ELABORATE LIE</i>
<i>SO I COULD SWITCH SIDES?</i>

00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:33.131
<i>THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT!</i>

00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:34.931
Haru: <i>WELL, IF YOU</i>
<i>DON’T BELIEVE ME,</i>

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.165
<i>IT’S NOT REALLY ABOUT</i>
<i>THE EVIDENCE ANYMORE.</i>

00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:40.231
<i>LOOK, IT’S UP TO YOU</i>
<i>WHETHER YOU WANT TO</i>
<i>TRUST ME OR NOT.</i>

00:08:40.231 --> 00:08:43.498
Kuroyukihime:
<i>IS THAT HOW</i>
<i>YOU TRULY FEEL?</i>

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:44.931
<i>JUST DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT.</i>

00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:46.465
<i>I MEAN,</i>
<i>LET’S BE HONEST.</i>

00:08:46.465 --> 00:08:48.198
<i>I’M NOTHING MORE</i>
<i>THAN A PAWN.</i>

00:08:48.198 --> 00:08:50.698
<i>A TOOL YOU CAN TOSS</i>
<i>ASIDE WHEN YOU’RE</i>
<i>DONE USING IT.</i>

00:08:50.698 --> 00:08:52.698
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.531
<i>YOU’RE MAD AT ME,</i>
<i>AREN’T YOU?</i>

00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.765
<i>LISTEN, THE WAY I</i>
<i>BEHAVED WAS WRONG.</i>

00:08:56.765 --> 00:08:59.098
<i>AND I ADMIT THAT.</i>
<i>I’M SORRY!</i>

00:08:59.098 --> 00:09:02.098
<i>IT’S JUST...</i>
<i>THERE ARE TIMES WHEN...</i>

00:09:02.098 --> 00:09:04.631
<i>WHEN I CAN’T ALWAYS</i>
<i>CONTROL MY EMOTIONS.</i>

00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:09.065
<i>AND IT SEEMS, ESPECIALLY</i>
<i>WHEN IT COMES TO YOU</i>
<i>AND KURASHIMA, I JUST...</i>

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:10.765
<i>WHAT I’M TRYING</i>
<i>TO SAY IS...</i>

00:09:10.765 --> 00:09:13.498
<i>OKAY,</i>
<i>THAT’S ENOUGH.</i>
<i>HUH?</i>

00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:16.965
<i>THIS ISN’T JUST</i>
<i>PAINFUL TO WATCH.</i>
<i>IT’S KIND OF PATHETIC.</i>

00:09:16.965 --> 00:09:18.931
<i>WHAT ARE YOU</i>
<i>TALKING ABOUT?</i>

00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:23.531
<i>LET ME GUESS.</i>
<i>YOU HATE YOURSELF,</i>
<i>DON’T YOU?</i>

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:25.765
Haru: <i>YOU’RE ONE OF THOSE</i>
<i>GIRLS WHO’S PERFECT AT</i>
<i>EVERYTHING SHE DOES,</i>

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.198
<i>AND NOW YOU HATE</i>
<i>YOURSELF FOR IT.</i>

00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:29.331
<i>THAT’S WHY</i>
<i>YOU’RE DOING THIS.</i>

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.231
<i>DEMEANING YOURSELF</i>
<i>BY PRETENDING TO LIKE</i>
<i>SOMEONE LIKE ME.</i>

00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:33.898
<i>I GET IT, OKAY?</i>

00:09:33.898 --> 00:09:36.065
<i>BUT JUST DROP THE ACT.</i>
<i>YOU DON’T NEED TO DO THIS.</i>

00:09:36.065 --> 00:09:38.465
<i>I’LL DO WHATEVER</i>
<i>YOU WANT ANYWAY.</i>

00:09:38.465 --> 00:09:40.898
<i>I DON’T NEED YOUR THANKS,</i>
<i>OR EVEN THE PRETENSE</i>
<i>THAT YOU LIKE ME.</i>

00:09:40.898 --> 00:09:43.965
<i>JUST TELL ME WHAT TO</i>
<i>DO, AND TOSS ME ASIDE</i>
<i>WHEN YOU’RE DONE.</i>

00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:46.365
<i>THAT’S THE WAY IT WORKS</i>
<i>BETWEEN PEOPLE LIKE</i>
<i>YOU AND ME.</i>

00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:49.798
<i>THAT’S HOW YOU</i>
<i>SHOULD TREAT ME,</i>
<i>AND YOU KNOW IT!</i>

00:09:52.865 --> 00:09:54.865
( sobs )
( slapping noise )

00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:58.065
( gasps )

00:09:58.065 --> 00:10:00.431
YOU IDIOT!

00:10:00.431 --> 00:10:02.031
( confused noises )

00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:04.765
( crying )

00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:06.798
Kuroyukihime:
HOW COULD YOU BE...

00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:11.098
SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?!

00:10:11.098 --> 00:10:12.865
( car tires screeching )

00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:21.698
( both gasping )

00:10:27.476 --> 00:10:28.842
Both:
BURST LINK!

00:10:30.176 --> 00:10:32.709
OH!

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:33.876
Haru:
MAN, THAT WAS CLOSE!

00:10:33.876 --> 00:10:36.176
A SPLIT SECOND
LATER, AND...

00:10:36.176 --> 00:10:40.209
BUT HOLD ON. WE’VE
ONLY ACCELERATED TIME,
NOT STOPPED IT.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:43.176
AT SOME POINT,
WE’LL HAVE TO BURST OUT...

00:10:43.176 --> 00:10:46.376
THEY SAY A.I. CONTROLLED
CARS ARE FOOLPROOF.

00:10:46.376 --> 00:10:49.776
THERE’S NO WAY TO GET
INTO AN ACCIDENT WITH
ONE OF THESE THINGS.

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:53.442
SO, THEN...
WAS THIS ON PURPOSE?
( gasps )

00:10:53.442 --> 00:10:56.109
THAT’S...ARAYA!

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:58.376
DOES THIS MEAN
THAT HE’S CYAN PILE?

00:10:58.376 --> 00:11:00.776
Kuroyukihime:
NO. HE JUST
WANTS REVENGE.

00:11:00.776 --> 00:11:02.476
I BLAME
MYSELF.

00:11:02.476 --> 00:11:04.942
I SHOULD HAVE
BEEN MORE CAUTIOUS
AND SEEN THIS COMING.

00:11:04.942 --> 00:11:07.109
IF YOU’RE DEAD SET
ON ATTACKING SOMEBODY,

00:11:07.109 --> 00:11:09.309
YOU DON’T NEED
ACCELERATION POWERS.

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:12.942
AS WE CAN SEE, A KNIFE
OR A CAR WILL DO FINE.

00:11:12.942 --> 00:11:14.942
I SUPPOSE I HAD
THIS COMING.

00:11:14.942 --> 00:11:17.842
MY PUNISHMENT FOR TOYING
WITH THE LIVES OF OTHERS,

00:11:17.842 --> 00:11:20.409
WITHOUT EVER CARING
HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THEM.

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:24.042
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:26.309
HARUYUKI,
FORGIVE ME.

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:29.242
I’M THE PERSON
WHO HAS CAUSED
ALL THIS.

00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:31.742
BUT I PROMISE TO NEVER
LET YOU GET HURT.

00:11:31.742 --> 00:11:33.876
I’LL PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS.

00:11:33.876 --> 00:11:36.576
UM, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:11:36.576 --> 00:11:40.176
THERE’S AN ASPECT
OF BRAIN BURST THAT I
HAVE YET TO TELL YOU ABOUT:

00:11:40.176 --> 00:11:43.176
THE ULTIMATE AND FINAL
ACCELERATION POWER.

00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:45.942
NO! WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU CAN NEVER USE IT!

00:11:45.942 --> 00:11:48.676
IF A POWER LIKE THAT
EXISTS, THEN LET <i>ME</i> USE IT.

00:11:48.676 --> 00:11:51.109
I’M YOUR PAWN, THAT’S WHAT
I’M SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:54.209
I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU
AT ALL COSTS!

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:55.276
YOU CAN’T.

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:56.842
THE ONLY ONES WHO
CAN USE THIS POWER

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:58.709
ARE THE PLAYERS WHO
HAVE REACHED LEVEL 9.

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:01.642
AND YOU LOSE 99%
OF YOUR POINTS
WHEN YOU DO.

00:12:01.642 --> 00:12:04.809
BUT REGARDLESS
OF ALL THAT,
I’M YOUR GUARDIAN.

00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:06.742
I HAVE TO
PROTECT YOU.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:08.342
( sobs )
YEAH, BUT--

00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:10.342
THERE’S NO REASON
TO CRY.

00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:11.976
I HAVE TO SAY...

00:12:11.976 --> 00:12:15.109
AT LEAST THERE’S
ONE POSITIVE THING
COMING FROM ALL THIS.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.776
LIKE WHAT?

00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:19.442
IN A DIRE MOMENT
LIKE THIS...

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:22.742
I THINK YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BELIEVE
MY FINAL WORDS.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.042
AT LEAST I HOPE SO.

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:28.476
HARUYUKI... PLEASE KNOW
THAT I LOVE YOU.

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:31.176
( gasps )
I’VE NEVER
FELT THIS WAY
ABOUT ANYONE.

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:34.142
AND IT’S BEEN
VERY CONFUSING
FOR ME.

00:12:34.142 --> 00:12:36.376
I’M CONSTANTLY
THINKING ABOUT YOU...

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:40.542
AND THESE THOUGHTS I HAVE
MAKE ME BOTH HAPPY AND SAD.

00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:43.609
I GUESS THAT’S JUST WHAT
BEING IN LOVE DOES TO YOU.

00:12:43.609 --> 00:12:46.776
BUT WHY ME? I MEAN,
OF ALL THE PEOPLE...

00:12:46.776 --> 00:12:50.576
WHY WOULD YOU EVER
CHOOSE ME?

00:12:50.576 --> 00:12:52.542
WELL, THINK BACK.

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:55.376
DO YOU REMEMBER THE
FIRST TIME YOU AND I MADE
CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER?

00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.709
YES, OF COURSE.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.842
Kuroyukihime: IN ORDER
TO BEAT YOU AT THAT GAME

00:12:58.842 --> 00:13:00.542
AND GET THE HIGHEST SCORE,

00:13:00.542 --> 00:13:02.376
I HAD TO ACCELERATE.

00:13:02.376 --> 00:13:03.376
HUH?

00:13:03.376 --> 00:13:04.909
I WANTED TO
IMPRESS YOU,

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:07.376
SO I COULD PERSUADE
YOU MORE EASILY.

00:13:07.376 --> 00:13:10.342
I’VE BEEN A BURST-LINKER
FOR OVER SIX YEARS NOW.

00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:15.176
AND IN MY QUEST FOR SPEED
AND POWER, I’VE SLAUGHTERED
THOUSANDS OF ENEMIES...

00:13:15.176 --> 00:13:18.242
AND ALONG THE WAY,
EVEN A FEW OF MY FRIENDS.

00:13:18.242 --> 00:13:24.276
BUT EVEN SOMEONE AS HIGHLY
RANKED AS ME COULD COME
NOWHERE NEAR YOUR HIGH SCORE.

00:13:24.276 --> 00:13:28.776
YOU’RE THE FASTEST
THERE IS, NO ONE
IS BETTER. NO ONE.

00:13:28.776 --> 00:13:33.242
AND I KNOW THAT SOMEDAY,
THE REST OF THE ACCELERATED
WORLD WILL KNOW THIS AS WELL,

00:13:33.242 --> 00:13:36.009
THAT YOU ARE THE
FASTEST LINKER
TO EVER EXIST.

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:38.476
YOU WILL DEFEAT THE KINGS,
RISE UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL,

00:13:38.476 --> 00:13:41.142
AND DISCOVER THE TRUE
MEANING OF BRAIN BURST.

00:13:41.142 --> 00:13:43.976
AND BY DOING THAT, YOU WILL
UNLOCK THE TRUE POTENTIAL

00:13:43.976 --> 00:13:46.776
THAT LIES DEEP WITHIN
OUR MINDS AND SOULS.

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:49.042
WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU
PLAYING THAT GAME,

00:13:49.042 --> 00:13:51.442
MY BODY TREMBLED
WITH EXCITEMENT.

00:13:51.442 --> 00:13:55.442
WATCHING SOMEONE BE
SO FAST AND MAGNIFICENT,
AND YET...

00:13:55.442 --> 00:13:58.309
IN THE REAL WORLD,
YOU’RE SO PAINFULLY FRAGILE.

00:13:58.309 --> 00:14:00.242
WHEN I FINALLY
REALIZED THIS,

00:14:00.242 --> 00:14:03.176
IT HURT MY HEART
SO MUCH IT NEARLY
TORE ME APART.

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.576
( sobs )

00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:06.776
I WANT TO BOW
BEFORE YOU LIKE
I WOULD A KING...

00:14:06.776 --> 00:14:08.342
WHICH YOU WILL BECOME.

00:14:08.342 --> 00:14:10.676
BUT I ALSO WANT TO
HOLD AND PROTECT YOU.

00:14:10.676 --> 00:14:14.942
ALL OF THESE CONTRADICTORY
FEELINGS FINALLY WELLED
UP INSIDE ME...

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:16.909
AND I REALLY
FELL FOR YOU.

00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:19.809
BUT I ONLY
FULLY REALIZED
THIS YESTERDAY.

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:21.442
YESTERDAY?

00:14:21.442 --> 00:14:24.242
WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
CABLE-LINKING WITH
KURASHIMA.

00:14:24.242 --> 00:14:30.942
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I WAS
JEALOUS OF SOMEONE.

00:14:30.942 --> 00:14:33.276
I WISH I’D REALIZED
THIS SOONER.

00:14:33.276 --> 00:14:35.942
BUT STILL, I HAVE BEEN
AFFORDED THIS MOMENT.

00:14:35.942 --> 00:14:38.176
MY CHANCE TO DECLARE
MY LOVE FOR YOU.

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:41.809
I HAD HOPED THAT I WOULD
BE ABLE TO TELL YOU THIS
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:43.609
BUT NOW, MY TIME IS UP.

00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:44.776
( sobs )

00:14:44.776 --> 00:14:47.642
WORK HARD.
GET STRONGER
AND FASTER.

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:49.109
CLIMB YOUR WAY
TO THE TOP.

00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:51.442
AND SEE THE WORLD
FROM THERE
IN MY PLACE.

00:14:51.442 --> 00:14:55.209
NO, DON’T!
YOU CAN’T
LEAVE ME LIKE THIS.

00:14:55.209 --> 00:14:58.509
I’M THE ONE WHO’S
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU!

00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:00.776
BUT...
I HAVEN’T.

00:15:00.776 --> 00:15:06.876
I HAVEN’T DONE...
<i>ANYTHING</i> FOR YOU.

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:12.376
( gasps )

00:15:12.376 --> 00:15:13.542
IT’S OKAY.

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:15.442
I’M SURE WE’LL
MEET AGAIN SOMEDAY.

00:15:20.309 --> 00:15:23.309
NO! PLEASE DON’T
DO THIS! PLEASE!

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.509
STOP!

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:29.909
PHYSICAL
FULL BURST!

00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:34.676
( grunting )

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.776
( gasps )
IMPOSSIBLE...

00:15:45.776 --> 00:15:47.642
HER BODY.
IT’S MOVING!

00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:50.009
Kuroyukihime:
<i>THERE’S A THEORY</i>
<i>THAT SUGGESTS</i>

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:53.942
<i>THAT ONE’S HEARTBEAT IS</i>
<i>THE BASE CLOCK FOR THE SPEED</i>
<i>OF HUMAN THOUGHT PROCESS.</i>

00:15:53.942 --> 00:15:58.242
<i>WHY DOES TIME SEEM TO SLOW DOWN</i>
<i>TO A CRAWL FOR SOMEONE LIKE</i>
<i>A RACECAR DRIVER?</i>

00:15:58.242 --> 00:16:03.176
<i>OR HOW CAN A MINUTE FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>AN ETERNITY FOR TWO LOVERS WHEN</i>
<i>THEY’RE IN EACH OTHER’S ARMS?</i>

00:16:03.176 --> 00:16:08.942
<i>IT’S BECAUSE WHEN THE HUMAN</i>
<i>HEART RATE INCREASES, SO DOES</i>
<i>OUR CAPACITY TO PROCESS DATA.</i>

00:16:08.942 --> 00:16:11.376
<i>BRAIN BURST</i>
<i>UTILIZES THIS THEORY.</i>

00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:15.609
<i>BY ACCESSING THE NEURO-LINKER,</i>
<i>IT SPEEDS UP YOUR HEART RATE-</i>
<i>THE BASE CLOCK-</i>

00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:20.276
<i>A THOUSAND TIMES, AND IN</i>
<i>RETURN, IT ACCELERATES</i>
<i>YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS.</i>

00:16:20.276 --> 00:16:24.942
<i>ACCESSING THIS ILLICIT POWER</i>
<i>WITHIN YOUR OWN BODY</i>
<i>IS CALLED...</i>

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:27.109
<i>PHYSICAL FULL BURST.</i>

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:33.476
<i>HARUYUKI... WHENEVER I’M</i>
<i>WITH YOU, MY HEART IS</i>
<i>ALWAYS RACING NONSTOP.</i>

00:16:33.476 --> 00:16:37.076
<i>EVEN WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE</i>
<i>OF A NEURO-LINKER</i>
<i>OR BRAIN BURST,</i>

00:16:37.076 --> 00:16:40.442
<i>I CONSTANTLY FELT</i>
<i>LIKE I WAS ACCELERATING</i>
<i>AROUND YOU.</i>

00:16:40.442 --> 00:16:44.442
<i>THAT’S WHY I CAN DIE</i>
<i>WITH A SMILE.</i>

00:16:44.442 --> 00:16:49.242
<i>BECAUSE IN A SHORT TIME,</i>
<i>YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN ETERNITY.</i>

00:16:50.842 --> 00:16:52.209
( sobbing )

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:57.042
( loud crash )

00:16:57.042 --> 00:17:01.376
Man: WHAT HAPPENED?!
Woman: SOMEBODY GET HELP!

00:17:01.376 --> 00:17:03.942
( grunting )
( scattered crowd chatter )

00:17:03.942 --> 00:17:05.776
Woman:
CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE.

00:17:05.776 --> 00:17:08.142
Man:
SHE OKAY?

00:17:08.142 --> 00:17:11.109
( gasps )

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.309
( gasps )

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:15.476
Woman:
OH!
( crowd murmuring )

00:17:15.476 --> 00:17:18.309
Haru ( sobbing ):
NO!

00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:39.342
( sobbing )

00:17:47.676 --> 00:17:50.109
Haru:
HER SCHOOL JOURNAL...

00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:06.176
( gasps )

00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:12.309
IT’S MY FAULT.
IT’S ALL MY FAULT...

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:16.042
( bawling )

00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:18.109
Doctor: WE’VE
MANAGED TO STOP
THE BLEEDING.

00:18:18.109 --> 00:18:21.742
THE SYNTHETIC PROTEIN
MICRO-MACHINES ARE
CURRENTLY WORKING FULL TIME

00:18:21.742 --> 00:18:23.776
IN ORDER TO REPAIR
THE AFFECTED TISSUE.

00:18:23.776 --> 00:18:25.642
BUT THERE’S A LOT
OF INTERNAL DAMAGE,

00:18:25.642 --> 00:18:28.409
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
HER TO GO INTO SHOCK
AT ANY MOMENT IS HIGH.

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:32.442
JUST KNOW THAT
THE NEXT 12 HOURS
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL.

00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:35.976
TWELVE HOURS.

00:18:35.976 --> 00:18:38.376
Nurse: YOU REALLY SHOULD
GO HOME AND REST.

00:18:38.376 --> 00:18:40.976
WE’VE ALREADY CONTACTED
HER FAMILY.

00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.809
SOMEONE WILL
COME BY TOMORROW.

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:45.176
BUT THEN
IT MAY BE
TOO LATE.

00:18:45.176 --> 00:18:46.576
I CAN’T JUST
LEAVE HER ALONE

00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:48.709
WHEN SHE’S
IN THERE FIGHTING
FOR HER LIFE.

00:18:48.709 --> 00:18:49.809
I’M STAYING.

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:51.542
ALL RIGHT,
THEN.

00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:53.676
IF YOU’RE GOING
TO STAY, I’LL
GET YOU A BLANKET.

00:18:53.676 --> 00:18:57.342
TRY TO GET SOME
REST IF YOU CAN.

00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:03.042
( gasps )

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.276
WAIT! W-WHAT ABOUT
HER NEURO-LINKER?

00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:07.376
YOU DON’T KNOW
IF SHE STILL HAS
IT ON HER, DO YOU?

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:10.076
YES. THAT’S HOW
WE’RE MONITORING
HER BRAINWAVES.

LINKED INTO SOME
OTHER NETWORK?

00:19:13.676 --> 00:19:18.042
WELL, YES, IT CONNECTS
HER TO THE NET HERE
AT THE HOSPITAL.
