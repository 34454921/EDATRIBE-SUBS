WEBVTT

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:11.850
CHIYU, LOOK...

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.583
I’M NOT TALKING
TO YOU, HARU.
OH!

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:16.183
HMM? SO THAT’S WHAT YOU
THINK OF ME?

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.983
THAT I’M TOYING
WITH ARITA TO AMUSE MYSELF?

00:00:18.983 --> 00:00:20.417
IF I’M WRONG, TELL ME.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.783
I KNOW HARU,
AND THERE’S NOTHING
HE HATES MORE

00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:25.250
THAN BEING THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION.
I SEE.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.083
WELL, EVEN IF YOU’RE
RIGHT ABOUT ME,

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:29.450
I FAIL TO SEE
HOW THIS CONCERNS YOU.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.150
OF COURSE IT DOES.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.617
I’VE KNOWN HARU LONGER
THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN THIS ENTIRE SCHOOL.

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:34.917
HE’S MY FRIEND.

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:37.317
OH...YOU’RE HIS FRIEND.

00:00:37.317 --> 00:00:40.717
WELL I’M SORRY, BUT I’M
MORE THAN JUST HIS FRIEND.

00:00:40.717 --> 00:00:44.450
THE TRUTH IS I’VE
ASKED ARITA, HERE,
TO BE MY BOYFRIEND.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.450
AND WE’RE ABOUT TO HAVE
OUR FIRST DATE.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.183
( gasps )
( gasps )

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:49.383
( gasping )

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.417
( whimpers )

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:54.650
( thinking )
<i>OH GOD, OH GOD,</i>
<i>I DON’T BELIEVE IT.</i>

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.717
<i>NOW I’M GONNA</i>
<i>HAVE TO CHANGE SCHOOLS!</i>

00:00:56.717 --> 00:00:58.683
YOU HAVE A NICE DAY...
( whimpering )

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.383
<i>FRIEND.</i>

00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.150
( whimpering )

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.950
HMM.

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:09.783
Haru: <i>WHAT WERE YOU</i>
<i>THINKING BACK THERE?</i>

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:12.117
YOU DO REALIZE YOU CAN’T
SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM YOU HAVE

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:13.983
BY ACCELERATING YOUR WAY
OUT OF IT, RIGHT?

00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:16.850
YES, THAT’S A CRITICAL LESSON
THAT ALL BURST LINKERS
MUST LEARN.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.183
IT’S GOOD YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT.
UH, NO.

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:20.850
THERE’S NOTHING
GOOD ABOUT THIS.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.917
LOOK, I PROVOKED KURASHIMA
FOR A REASON.

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:25.250
THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT HER,
SO I EGGED HER ON,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.917
AND NOW I’VE CONFIRMED
MY SUSPICIONS.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.283
HUH? WHY WOULD YOU
BE SUSPICIOUS OF CHIYU?

00:01:29.283 --> 00:01:30.883
SHE WOULDN’T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:33.650
OH? ARE YOU TWO
MORE THAN JUST FRIENDS?
NO, NO, NO!

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.083
IT’S NOTHING LIKE THAT!
I’VE JUST KNOWN HER
FOR AGES!

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.217
A-AND BESIDES, SHE’S
ALREADY GOT A BOYFRIEND!

00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:39.883
WELL THAT’S GOOD TO KNOW,

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:43.150
BUT EACH OF YOU HAVE CAUGHT
MY ATTENTION FOR COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT REASONS.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.883
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:46.850
IT’S A LITTLE
DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.617
BUT JUST KNOW
THAT IT HAS TO DO
WITH ONE OF THE REASONS

00:01:49.617 --> 00:01:51.617
I’VE SOUGHT YOU OUT.
OH...

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:53.617
♪

00:01:53.617 --> 00:01:55.883
( singing in Japanese )

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.393
Kuroyukihime:
HERE’S TO YOUR
FIRST VICTORY.

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:31.960
AT THIS RATE, YOU’LL
REACH LEVEL TWO IN NO TIME.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.327
UH, YEAH, THANK YOU.

00:03:34.327 --> 00:03:37.427
BUT I STILL HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN BEFORE GETTING
THAT FAR.

00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:39.593
YOU <i>DO</i> HAVE A HARD
JOURNEY AHEAD OF YOU.

00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:42.960
OF THE ESTIMATED
1,000 BURST LINKERS
THAT ARE OUT THERE,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.793
ONLY A SELECT FEW HAVE EVER
MADE IT TO LEVEL FOUR.

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:48.627
AND IF YOU RUN INTO A PLAYER
FROM LEVEL SEVEN OR EIGHT,

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:50.727
IT’S SAFE TO ASSUME
THEY’RE A LEGION LEADER.

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:52.660
W-WHAT’S A LEGION?

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.027
IT’S SORT OF LIKE A TEAM
THAT YOU WOULD FIND
IN OTHER ONLINE GAMES.

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.660
IT’S JUST THAT HERE
WE CALL THEM "LEGIONS."

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.693
CURRENTLY, THE ACCELERATED
WORLD HAS SIX MAJOR LEGIONS

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:04.527
RULING OVER A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT ZONES.

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:06.660
ALL THESE LEGIONS
ARE LED BY BURST LINKERS

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.993
WHO HAVE REACHED LEVEL NINE.

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:09.393
EACH HAS THEIR OWN COLOR:

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:12.293
BLUE, RED, YELLOW, GREEN,
PURPLE, AND WHITE.

00:04:12.293 --> 00:04:15.093
THEY’RE KNOWN
AS THE "SIX KINGS
OF PURE COLOR."

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:16.993
I’VE NEVER HEARD
OF A GAME LIKE THIS,

00:04:16.993 --> 00:04:19.660
WHERE ONLY SIX PEOPLE
HAVE EVER REACHED
THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.293
NOT SO FAST.
I NEVER SAID LEVEL NINE
WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:26.360
WELL, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE AT LEVEL TEN, THEN?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.327
<i>BRAIN BURST 2039</i>
IS SOMETHING PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN PLAYING

00:04:29.327 --> 00:04:30.593
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW,

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:33.493
EVER SINCE THE PROGRAM
WAS ANONYMOUSLY RELEASED.

00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:35.960
BUT DUE TO THE SEVERE RULES
THAT COME WITH THE GAME,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.027
NO ONE HAS EVER
REACHED LEVEL TEN.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:40.127
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU
HAVE TO FIGHT ALL THE TIME?

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:42.493
HAVE, LIKE, 10,000 WINS
OR SOMETHING?

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:44.527
YOU ONLY NEED FIVE WINS,

00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:47.160
BUT THOSE WINS HAVE TO BE
AGAINST LEVEL NINE OPPONENTS.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.660
AND IF YOU LOSE JUST
ONE OF THOSE FIGHTS,
YOU LOSE ALL YOUR POINTS.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.660
AND THEN THE PROGRAM
AUTOMATICALLY UNINSTALLS.
( gasps softly )

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.193
Kuroyukihime:
THIS PROGRAM HAS REMAINED
A SECRET FOR SEVEN YEARS.

00:04:57.193 --> 00:05:00.427
IT’S QUITE A FEAT.
ANY IDEA HOW THEY’VE DONE IT?
NO.

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:02.393
BECAUSE IT HAS SOME
VERY DEMANDING REQUIREMENTS.

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:03.593
LIKE WHAT?

00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:05.827
I’D SAY ONE OF THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT REQUIREMENTS

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:08.827
IS THAT EVERY BURST LINK PLAYER
HAS TO HAVE WORN A NEURO-LINKER

00:05:08.827 --> 00:05:10.127
FROM THE DAY THEY WERE BORN.

00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:12.927
THE NEURO-LINKER IS STILL
A FAIRLY NEW TECHNOLOGY.

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:16.027
EVEN THE FIRST-GENERATION
DEVICE ONLY CAME OUT
15 YEARS AGO.

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:19.227
THAT MEANS NO ADULT
HAS EVERY PLAYED <i>BRAIN BURST.</i>

00:05:19.227 --> 00:05:21.660
ALL OF US WHO PLAY THE GAME
ARE KIDS.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.027
AND BECAUSE OF THIS,
WE TRY TO KEEP THAT PRIVILEGE
TO OURSELVES.

00:05:25.027 --> 00:05:28.960
AND ONCE THE PROGRAM
UNINSTALLS, IT LEAVES
ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.727
WHATEVER YOU SAY ABOUT IT
WILL BE DISMISSED AS NONSENSE.

00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:36.093
TWO YEARS AGO,
ALL THE YOUNG KINGS
REACHED LEVEL NINE

00:05:36.093 --> 00:05:37.960
AT APPROXIMATELY
THE SAME TIME.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.060
THEY SOON RECEIVED A SYSTEM
MESSAGE TELLING THEM
THE HORRIBLE RULES IN PLACE

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.893
FOR REACHING LEVEL TEN.

00:05:42.893 --> 00:05:46.427
YOU WOULD’VE EXPECTED SOME
SORT OF BLOODY POWER STRUGGLE
TO BREAK OUT,

00:05:46.427 --> 00:05:49.993
BUT INSTEAD THE KINGS
CHOSE TO REMAIN
AT LEVEL NINE INDEFINITELY.

00:05:49.993 --> 00:05:52.693
THEY CALLED A TRUCE AND DIVIDED
THE ACCELERATED WORLD

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:54.660
INTO REALMS EACH OF THEM
WOULD RULE.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.060
THE WHOLE THING’S A FARCE.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.060
FIRST THEY DESTROY
COUNTLESS BURST LINKERS

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.627
TO REACH LEVEL NINE,
AND THEN THEY CREATE A TRUCE?

00:06:00.627 --> 00:06:02.227
WHY?
( gulps )

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:04.827
SO IS THAT IT?
IS THAT WHAT YOU’RE PLANNING?

00:06:04.827 --> 00:06:07.293
TO CHALLENGE THE SIX
KINGS OF PURE COLOR?

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:09.393
NO. I’VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:10.460
WHAT?

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.127
THERE HAVEN’T ALWAYS
BEEN SIX.

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:13.593
THERE USED TO BE SEVEN KINGS,

00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.427
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY
WERE EACH ESSENTIALLY RIVALS,

00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:18.693
THERE WAS ALSO A STRONG BOND
BETWEEN THEM.

00:06:18.693 --> 00:06:20.760
BUT THAT CHANGED
TWO YEARS AGO.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.393
ONE NIGHT, THE BLACK KING
BETRAYED THE OTHERS AND TRIED
TO HUNT THEM ALL DOWN.

00:06:24.393 --> 00:06:26.093
WHO IS THIS BLACK KING?

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:29.393
I’M THE BLACK KING,
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS "BLACK LOTUS."

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:31.627
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO REJECTED THE TRUCE,

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:35.493
AND INSTEAD ARGUED THAT
WE SHOULD RISK IT ALL
AND FIGHT TO THE END.

00:06:35.493 --> 00:06:37.793
BUT THEY OVERRULED MY IDEA,

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:40.893
AND WHEN THEY DID,
I BEHEADED THE RED KING,

00:06:40.893 --> 00:06:43.660
THE PERSON CLOSEST TO ME
CALLING FOR PEACE.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.093
( breathing heavily )

00:06:45.093 --> 00:06:48.093
HIS <i>BRAIN BURST</i> PROGRAM
WAS INSTANTLY UNINSTALLED,

00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:50.293
WHICH CAUSE HIS GIRLFRIEND,
THE PURPLE KING,

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:51.827
TO SCREAM IN ANGUISH.

00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:53.727
THE BLUE KING BECAME ENRAGED.

00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:55.493
I FOUGHT IN A FURIOUS FRENZY,

00:06:55.493 --> 00:06:58.827
BUT IN THE END, I WAS UNABLE
TO DEFEAT ANYONE ELSE.

00:06:58.827 --> 00:07:02.427
AFTER 30 MINUTES HAD PASSED,
I LINKED OUT.

00:07:02.427 --> 00:07:05.227
AND EVER SINCE THAT DAY,
I’VE BEEN ON THE RUN, HIDING.

00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:08.760
I’VE BEEN BRANDED
THE GREATEST TRAITOR
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.260
AS A RESULT,
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS
BOUNTY ON MY HEAD.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.293
A FITTING END
FOR A COWARD LIKE ME.

00:07:14.293 --> 00:07:15.927
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:19.293
BECAUSE THE ONLY
THING I CARED ABOUT
WAS REACHING LEVEL TEN.

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:22.827
ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM MESSAGE
WE RECEIVED WHEN WE MADE LEVEL
NINE,

00:07:22.827 --> 00:07:25.327
ANY PLAYER WHO MANAGED
TO REACH LEVEL TEN

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:28.160
WOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO MEET
THE CREATOR OF <i>BRAIN BURST.</i>

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.527
AND IN THAT MEETING,
YOU WOULD FIND OUT
THE TRUE MEANING OF THE GAME,

00:07:31.527 --> 00:07:33.727
AS WELL AS ITS ULTIMATE
GOAL AND PURPOSE.

00:07:33.727 --> 00:07:36.760
I’M STILL DESPERATE
TO FIND THE ANSWER.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.927
WE EACH ACCELERATE AND FIGHT
FOR VARIOUS REASONS.

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:43.160
SOMETIMES IT’S FOR MONEY.
SOMETIMES IT’S FOR SUCCESS.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.760
SOMETIMES FOR FAME.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.893
BUT IS THAT ALL THERE IS?

00:07:46.893 --> 00:07:50.460
IT CAN’T BE!
THERE HAS TO BE MORE.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.027
SOMETHING GREATER THAN WHAT
OUR MERE MORTAL COILS
COULD HAVE EVER HOPED FOR.

00:07:55.027 --> 00:07:56.293
( gasps softly )

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.393
( thinking )
<i>YOU KNOW, I GET IT.</i>

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:03.527
<i>MAYBE NOT ALL OF IT,</i>
<i>BUT I GET WHERE SHE’S</i>
<i>COMING FROM.</i>

00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:04.860
<i>I KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS.</i>

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.627
WELL, HAVE I THOROUGHLY
DISGUSTED YOU?

00:08:08.627 --> 00:08:11.027
DO YOU DESPISE ME NOW?

00:08:11.027 --> 00:08:13.893
NO. IT DOESN’T MATTER
WHAT THE GAME IS.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:16.160
IT’S STUPID TO GIVE UP
AND WANDER AROUND AIMLESSLY

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.927
WITHOUT TRYING
TO FINISH THE GAME.

00:08:17.927 --> 00:08:21.127
REACHING THE HIGHEST LEVEL
HAS TO BE WHAT <i>BRAIN BURST</i>
IS ALL ABOUT.

00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:23.260
WHY ELSE WOULD IT EXIST?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.927
OH.

00:08:24.927 --> 00:08:26.593
( chuckles )

00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:30.627
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
YOU’RE ALREADY MORE
OF A BURST LINKER THAN I AM.

00:08:30.627 --> 00:08:32.893
HEY, I’M TRYING
TO BE SERIOUS, HERE.

00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:35.327
LOOK, I THINK I SEE
WHERE YOU’RE COMING FROM,

00:08:35.327 --> 00:08:37.327
AND I’LL CONTINUE
TO HELP YOU OUT.

00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:40.593
IF I CAN, I’D LIKE
TO REACH LEVEL TEN
MYSELF SOME DAY.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.427
THANK YOU.
( gasps softly)

00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:46.960
I TRULY APPRECIATE THIS,
HARUYUKI.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.560
I TRUSTED MY INSTINCTS,
AND THEY WERE RIGHT.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.593
I’M QUITE PLEASED
THAT OF ALL THE PEOPLE,
I CHOSE YOU.

00:08:52.593 --> 00:08:54.860
( stammering )
YEAH, OKAY, THAT’S GREAT.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.727
A-ANYWAY, LET’S GET BACK
TO THE TOPIC AT HAND.

00:08:57.727 --> 00:09:00.093
( sighs )

00:09:00.093 --> 00:09:03.393
AS I WAS SAYING,
I’VE MANAGED TO SURVIVE
THESE PAST TWO YEARS,

00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:06.727
BUT IT HASN’T BEEN
BY ACCEPTING CHALLENGERS
AND WINNING FIGHTS.

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.727
I’M ONLY AROUND
BECAUSE FOR TWO YEARS,

00:09:08.727 --> 00:09:11.327
I HAVEN’T MADE A SINGLE
CONNECTION TO THE GLOBAL NET.

00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:13.793
REALLY?! NOT EVEN ONCE?

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:15.760
NO, BUT DUE
TO MY SOCIAL STATUS,

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.460
I CAN’T STAY
COMPLETELY OFFLINE.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.327
THERE IS ONE NETWORK
I MUST CONNECT TO
ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:24.093
YOUR SOCIAL STATUS?
WHAT, ARE YOU SECRETLY
ROYALTY OR SOMETHING?

00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:26.160
DON’T BE SILLY.
OH, RIGHT,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.827
YOU’RE TALKING
ABOUT SCHOOL STUFF.

00:09:27.827 --> 00:09:30.793
THEIR LOCAL NET.
WAIT--YOU MEAN
THAT’S NOT SAFE?

00:09:30.793 --> 00:09:32.760
IT WOULD SEEM IT ISN’T.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.893
<i>TWO MONTHS AGO,</i>

00:09:34.893 --> 00:09:38.560
<i>SOMEONE USED THE SCHOOL’S</i>
<i>LOCAL NET TO CHALLENGE ME</i>
<i>TO A DUEL.</i>

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.793
<i>THAT MEANS WHOEVER IT WAS</i>
<i>ATTENDS OUR SCHOOL.</i>

00:09:41.793 --> 00:09:43.627
Haru: <i>NO WAY!</i>

00:09:46.227 --> 00:09:48.560
( gasps )
ACCELERATION!

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.860
AT SCHOOL?
WHY CHALLENGE ME HERE?
( grunts )

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.760
OH, NO!
( grunts )

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760
Kuroyukihime:
<i>ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS</i>
<i>WITHIN</i> BRAIN BURST

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.227
<i>IS THE ABILITY TO SWITCH</i>
<i>TO A DUMMY AVATAR</i>

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:05.193
<i>FOR SPECTATING</i>
<i>AND WATCHING FIGHTS.</i>

00:10:05.193 --> 00:10:08.693
<i>THIS ALLOWS YOU</i>
<i>TO WATCH A FIGHT WHILE</i>
<i>HIDING YOUR REAL IDENTITY.</i>

00:10:08.693 --> 00:10:11.027
<i>HOWEVER, WHEN I WAS ATTACKED,</i>
( grunts )

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:15.193
<i>I HAD MY DUMMY AVATAR</i>
<i>SET TO THE EXACT SAME ONE</i>
<i>I USE ON THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.</i>

00:10:15.193 --> 00:10:17.060
<i>SO THEN...</i>

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:18.860
<i>THAT MEANS--</i>
<i>EXACTLY.</i>

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.260
<i>WHOEVER IT WAS</i>
<i>KNOWS MY TRUE IDENTITY.</i>

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.660
<i>THEY KNOW</i>
<i>I AM REALLY BLACK LOTUS.</i>

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.260
<i>TO REVEAL YOUR TRUE IDENTITY</i>
<i>IS THE ULTIMATE TABOO</i>

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.560
<i>FOR A BURST LINKER.</i>

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.593
( grunts )

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.403
I WAS CARELESS TO THINK
THAT I WOULD NOT BE CHALLENGED

00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:46.770
INSIDE THE LOCAL SCHOOL NET.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.437
I’M NOW CONSTANTLY
ON GUARD FOR AN ATTACK
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:10:50.437 --> 00:10:53.470
THAT CAN HAPPEN?
YOU CAN GET ATTACKED
IN THE REAL WORLD?

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.737
IT CAN, BUT NO ONE
HAS TRIED TO ATTACK
ME THERE, YET.

00:10:57.737 --> 00:11:00.037
THAT ISN’T THE CASE
FOR THE SCHOOL NET.

00:11:00.037 --> 00:11:01.537
IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS,

00:11:01.537 --> 00:11:05.003
THIS PERSON HAS CHALLENGED
ME MORE THAN TEN TIMES.

00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:07.137
NOW THAT THEY KNOW
MY REAL IDENTITY,

00:11:07.137 --> 00:11:10.437
THEY ARE PROBABLY
AFTER MY BURST POINTS.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:13.103
WELL WHY DON’T YOU
JUST DEFEAT THEM
USING YOUR DUEL AVATAR?

00:11:13.103 --> 00:11:14.837
THEN THEY WOULD GO AWAY.

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:17.803
IF I DO THAT, THEY
WILL MOST LIKELY GIVE UP
ON TRYING TO CHALLENGE ME

00:11:17.803 --> 00:11:20.937
AND INSTEAD SELL MY REAL
IDENTITY TO ONE OF THE KINGS.

00:11:20.937 --> 00:11:23.337
SO, WHAT’S YOUR PLAN, THEN?

00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:24.803
IF YOU’VE BEEN EXPOSED,

00:11:24.803 --> 00:11:27.737
YOU HAVE ONLY ONE OPTION:

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.370
TO FIND OUT YOUR ENEMY’S
REAL IDENTITY AS WELL.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.270
OF COURSE!
THEN THEY’D HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.637
SO, THAT SHOULD BE
PRETTY EASY TO DO, RIGHT?

00:11:37.637 --> 00:11:38.737
IS IT?

00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:41.703
YEAH. YOU JUST NEED EVERYONE
IN THE SAME PLACE.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:45.803
SO DURING A SCHOOL ASSEMBLY,
USE THE SCHOOL’S NETWORK
TO CHALLENGE THEM.

00:11:45.803 --> 00:11:49.870
IT SHOULD WORK SINCE ALL
STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO STAY
LOGGED IN DURING SCHOOL HOURS.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.903
AND ONCE A PLAYER
RECEIVES A CHALLENGE,
THEY CAN’T TURN IT DOWN.

00:11:52.903 --> 00:11:54.903
THE GAME WILL SHOW YOU
WHERE THEIR AVATAR IS SITTING,

00:11:54.903 --> 00:11:57.670
AND YOU CAN USE THAT
TO FIND OUT WHO THE STUDENT IS.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.403
HMM. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:11:59.403 --> 00:12:03.370
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING,
BUT IT TOOK ME AN ENTIRE DAY
TO COME UP WITH THAT PLAN.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.670
SO THEN YOU TRIED IT?

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.537
I DID, AND WHAT I FOUND
WAS ASTONISHING.

00:12:07.537 --> 00:12:08.537
TELL ME.

00:12:08.537 --> 00:12:10.403
WHO WAS IT?

00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:12.570
NO ONE.
HUH?

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.170
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLAYER
ON THE MATCHING LIST,
AND THAT WAS ME.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.670
BUT THERE’S MORE:

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.803
I COULDN’T FIND
THIS PERSON’S NAME
ON THE LIST,

00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:22.137
EVEN AFTER GETTING
OUT OF THERE WITH A DRAW.

00:12:22.137 --> 00:12:24.603
IT SEEMS WHOEVER THIS IS,
THEY’RE CLEVER.

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:26.837
THEY FIGURED OUT
HOW TO BLOCK A CHALLENGE.

00:12:27.903 --> 00:12:30.537
( sighs )
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

00:12:30.537 --> 00:12:34.003
IF IT IS, IT MEANS
THEY’RE AN INCREDIBLY
TALENTED HACKER,

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.403
GOOD ENOUGH TO CRACK
A REPORTEDLY IMPENETRABLE
PROGRAM.

00:12:37.403 --> 00:12:40.537
OR THEY SOMEHOW
KNOW THE GAME’S CREATOR.

00:12:40.537 --> 00:12:43.370
SO I’M GUESSING THIS IS HOW
I FIT IN TO ALL THIS.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.803
YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
FIND OUT WHO THIS ENEMY IS,
RIGHT?

00:12:46.803 --> 00:12:48.437
YES, VERY GOOD.

00:12:48.437 --> 00:12:51.437
THE NAME OF THIS AVATAR
IS CYAN PILE,

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:52.970
A LEVEL FOUR BURST LINKER

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.870
WHO, GOING OFF THEIR COLOR,

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.903
IS BEST
AT CLOSE-RANGE COMBAT.

00:12:56.903 --> 00:12:58.703
LEVEL FOUR, HUH?

00:12:58.703 --> 00:13:01.603
AND FROM WHAT I’VE GATHERED,
THIS PERSON IS A LITTLE
DESPERATE.

00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:03.370
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.470
THEY’RE AFRAID THEY’RE
GOING TO LOSE THE POWER
TO ACCELERATE.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.837
I CAN TELL BY THEIR MANIC
FIGHTING STYLE.

00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:11.570
IT’S VERY TYPICAL OF A PLAYER
WHO IS LOW ON POINTS.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.270
OKAY, GOT IT.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.237
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I NEED TO KNOW?

00:13:15.237 --> 00:13:18.570
YES...DON’T FORGET
ABOUT THE GUIDE CURSOR.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.870
IT’S AN EXCELLENT
SOURCE OF INFORMATION.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:24.670
IT’LL POINT TO YOUR ENEMY’S
LOCATION IMMEDIATELY
AFTER A FIGHT STARTS.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.770
USE IT.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.870
OH, I GET IT.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.437
SINCE ALL THESE STAGES
ARE BASED OFF REALITY--

00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:32.370
EXACTLY. BY REMEMBERING
WHERE THE CURSOR WAS POINTING,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.337
YOU CAN TRACK DOWN
YOUR OPPONENT
IN THE REAL WORLD, AS WELL.

00:13:35.337 --> 00:13:37.103
AFTER I WAS ATTACKED,

00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.837
I MADE A LIST
OF ALL THE STUDENTS THAT
WERE IN THE SAME VICINITY

00:13:39.837 --> 00:13:41.270
AS ME AT THE TIME,

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.037
THEN I USED THAT LIST
TO COME UP WITH THE MOST
LIKELY SUSPECT.

00:13:45.037 --> 00:13:46.703
THE NEXT TIME I’M ATTACKED,
HARUYUKI,

00:13:46.703 --> 00:13:49.470
YOU NEED TO BE THERE,
AND I WANT YOU TO USE
THE AUTO-VIEW

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.170
TO OBSERVE THE FIGHT.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.837
THAT WAY, YOU CAN
RECORD THE DIRECTION
OF CYAN PILE’S CURSOR.

00:13:54.837 --> 00:13:57.503
YEAH, IF WE HAVE TWO
POINTS OF REFERENCE...

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:59.337
THEN WE CAN PINPOINT
THE LOCATION,

00:13:59.337 --> 00:14:02.703
AND IN RETURN, FIND OUT
WHICH STUDENT WAS THERE
AT THE TIME...

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.603
AND WE CAN CONFIRM
CYAN PILE’S IDENTITY.

00:14:07.603 --> 00:14:08.837
( grunts softly )

00:14:08.837 --> 00:14:10.937
LAST WEEK,
BEFORE I APPROACHED YOU,

00:14:10.937 --> 00:14:14.303
I CREATED A FILE
ON WHOM I THOUGHT
WAS THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT.

00:14:15.603 --> 00:14:16.937
( grunts softly )

00:14:16.937 --> 00:14:19.003
( beeping )

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.937
( gasps )

00:14:20.937 --> 00:14:23.403
CHIYU, A BURST LINKER?

00:14:23.403 --> 00:14:25.670
NO WAY!
THERE’S BEEN A MISTAKE!

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.903
THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE!
SHE’S, LIKE, TERRIBLE AT GAMES.

00:14:27.903 --> 00:14:30.037
A-AND SHE’S NOT A STALKER,
EITHER!

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:33.303
SHE JUST ISN’T
THAT KIND OF PERSON.
I SWEAR IT!
REALLY?

00:14:33.303 --> 00:14:34.703
YOU SAW IT FOR YOURSELF--

00:14:34.703 --> 00:14:36.437
HOW HOSTILE
SHE WAS TOWARD ME.

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.570
YEAH, BUT THAT’S
NOT WHY SHE WAS UPSET!

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.670
IT’S BECAUSE YOU AND I
HAD CABLE LINKED TOGETHER.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.937
WHY WOULD THAT BOTHER HER?

00:14:41.937 --> 00:14:44.737
YOU SAID YOURSELF THAT
SHE HAS HER OWN BOYFRIEND.

00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:46.870
WELL...THAT’S TRUE.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.537
BUT, STILL...

00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:51.237
ALL RIGHT, STEP BACK
AND LOOK AT THIS
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:54.803
MAYBE SHE GOT UPSET
BECAUSE SHE WAS PLANNING
TO RECRUIT YOU FOR HERSELF,

00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:59.070
BUT THEN I CAME IN AND RUINED
EVERYTHING BY SNATCHING YOU UP
FOR MY PURPOSES,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.403
WHICH COMPELLED HER
TO GET MAD AND CONFRONT ME.

00:15:01.403 --> 00:15:03.003
IT’S PLAUSIBLE, ISN’T IT?

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:04.503
YEAH, I GUESS.

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:06.770
I NEED TO FIND THIS OUT
ON MY OWN, THOUGH.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.103
REALLY? YOU KNOW
YOU CAN’T JUST GO
AND ASK HER DIRECTLY, RIGHT?

00:15:11.103 --> 00:15:13.237
YEAH, OF COURSE
I KNOW THAT.

00:15:13.237 --> 00:15:15.137
BUT IF THE TWO OF US
CABLE LINK,

00:15:15.137 --> 00:15:17.570
THEN I CAN CHECK HER MEMORY
FOR THE PROGRAM.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.103
THAT’S TRUE.

00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:22.437
SO...I’LL GO
AND CABLE LINK WITH HER.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.703
( whimpers )

00:15:30.703 --> 00:15:34.370
OH, MAN... WHY DID
I SAY I WOULD DO THIS?

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.670
A CABLE LINK?!
( moans )

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.137
Taku: HARU?
HUH?

00:15:40.303 --> 00:15:41.670
HEY, TAKU!

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.870
THE NEXT KENDO TOURNAMENT
YOU HAVE IS GONNA
BE THE NATIONALS, RIGHT?

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.437
YEAH, BUT I DON’T KNOW
HOW WELL I’LL DO IN THAT ONE,
THOUGH.

00:15:53.437 --> 00:15:55.903
OH, COME ON.
I’M SURE YOU’RE
GONNA BE FINE.

00:15:55.903 --> 00:15:59.737
KNOWING YOU,
YOU’LL PROBABLY END UP
WINNING THE NATIONAL TITLE.

00:15:59.737 --> 00:16:02.137
DON’T MAKE IT SOUND EASY,
’CAUSE IT WON’T BE.

00:16:02.137 --> 00:16:03.137
( grunting softly )

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:07.370
( sighs, gulping )

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.203
AHH, THAT HIT THE SPOT.

00:16:09.203 --> 00:16:12.203
TASTES EVEN BETTER
SINCE YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO PAID FOR IT.

00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:13.303
HUH?
( whimpers )

00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:15.503
OH, WHAT DO I DO?
I’M SO NERVOUS.

00:16:15.503 --> 00:16:16.637
I’M REALLY WORRIED.

00:16:16.637 --> 00:16:18.870
WILL I WIN OR LOSE?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.103
( grunts )

00:16:20.103 --> 00:16:21.303
( stammers )

00:16:21.303 --> 00:16:22.570
( sighs, laughs )

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.770
OH, COME ON.
STOP MESSING WITH ME.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.037
( laughs )

00:16:26.037 --> 00:16:27.670
THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.670
( children laughing,
chattering )

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.303
Girl: ...KEEP UP!

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:33.237
I’M TRYING.
I’M TRYING.

00:16:34.303 --> 00:16:35.470
Haru: TAKU?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.470
YEAH?

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.670
LOOK...

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.970
DO YOU THINK THAT CHIYU...

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.870
WELL, DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD
EVER WANT SOMETHING BAD ENOUGH

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.237
SHE WOULD LIE, OR DECEIVE
A PERSON TO GET IT?

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:46.670
( sighs )

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.537
I DON’T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:16:48.537 --> 00:16:50.137
OF COURSE SHE WOULDN’T!

00:16:50.137 --> 00:16:52.270
THEN I GUESS YOU
HAVE YOUR ANSWER, DON’T YOU?

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.370
UH--

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.470
OH YEAH. YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.203
HUH. SORRY I EVEN ASKED.

00:16:57.203 --> 00:16:59.003
( chuckles )
FORGET I BROUGHT IT UP.

00:16:59.003 --> 00:17:00.203
IT’S FINE.

00:17:00.203 --> 00:17:01.703
THAT’S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:03.703
ISN’T THAT RIGHT?

00:17:03.703 --> 00:17:05.537
UH--

00:17:05.537 --> 00:17:08.003
HMM. RIGHT.

00:17:08.003 --> 00:17:09.670
NOW, THEN...AHH...

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.303
I THINK I’LL TAKE OFF
AND RUN ANOTHER LAP OR TWO.

00:17:12.303 --> 00:17:13.903
OKAY.

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.870
GOOD LUCK AT THE TOURNAMENT.
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE GREAT!
