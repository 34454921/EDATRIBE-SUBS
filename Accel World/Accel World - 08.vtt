00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.302
NOT DONE YET.

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:40.368
START!

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:41.735
<i>I HAVE TO GET BETTER.</i>

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.735
<i>I HAVE TO BE STRONGER</i>

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:45.568
<i>I HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER.</i>

00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:49.035
<i>SO THAT I CAN KEEP UP</i>

<i>THE RIGHT TO CONTROL</i>
<i>A TERRITORY IS DECIDED</i>

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:59.168
<i>THE LEGIONS GO AGAINST EACH</i>
<i>OTHER WITH THE SAME NUMBER</i>

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:01.768

<i>TO WIN, THEY MUST MAINTAIN</i>
<i>A WINNING PERCENTAGE</i>

00:01:04.568 --> 00:01:06.668
<i>OF 50% OR HIGHER.</i>

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.668
GO ON,
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS.

00:01:14.668 --> 00:01:16.968
WE’RE COUNTING ON YOU, HARU.
TAKE ’EM OUT WITH

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:18.235
YOUR USUAL ATTACK!

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:19.735
YOU GOT IT!

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:26.435
FIRST THING I’LL DO
IS TAKE OUT
THE ENEMIES FOOTHOLD.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.802
THEN I’LL SWOOP DOWN FROM
THE SKY AND FINISH ’EM OFF!

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:40.568
( gasps )

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.568
AHH!

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:47.002
( chuckles )

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.102
DAMN IT!

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:51.935
THAT MOVES GETTIN’ A LITTLE OLD,
DON’T YA THINK?

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.635
ONCE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT
A FEW TIMES AND FIGURE OUT

00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.235
WHAT IT IS,
IT MAKES YOU AN EASY TARGET.

00:01:58.235 --> 00:01:59.535
( gasps )

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.835

Girl: WHAT WAS THAT SCREAM
ALL ABOUT?

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.702
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:22.402
♪

00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:54.411
( bells chiming )

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.978
SO, THAT’S WHY YOU
BUILT THIS APP?

00:03:57.978 --> 00:03:59.545
TO DO THIS
EXTREME TRAINING?

00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:02.711
LOOK, WHEN I FIRST
STARTED FLYING
I WAS TOTALLY UNBEATABLE.

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.445
BUT EVER SINCE
I’VE MOVED UP
TO LEVEL 4

00:04:04.445 --> 00:04:05.811
I’VE BEEN
STUCK IN A RUT.

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:07.511
WE HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE
TO EXPAND THE TERRITORY

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:09.545
FOR NEGA NEBULOUS
ONE SINGLE BIT.

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:11.778
YEAH, BUT USING
AN ILLEGAL PATCH LIKE THAT

00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:15.045
AND PUSHING YOUR PAIN TOLERANCE
WAY BEYOND ITS NORMAL LIMITS,

00:04:15.045 --> 00:04:16.345
IT’S KINDA CRAZY.

00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:18.511
YEAH, BUT IF YOU TAKE
AWAY MY FLYING ABILITY,

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.378
THEN ALL YOU’RE LEFT WITH
IS A FRAGILE AVATAR

00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:22.411
WHO’S ONLY GOOD
AT CLOSE-RANGE COMBAT!

00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.611
SO I HAVE TO DO THIS.
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY

00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:26.511
TO DODGE
ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE!

00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:28.678
LOOK, I KNOW YOU’LL GET THERE,
JUST DON’T RUSH IT.

00:04:28.678 --> 00:04:31.345
I’M SURE OUR MASTER SAID
THE SAME THING TOO, RIGHT?

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.545
THIS IS SO BORING!
AFTER ALL THAT’S HAPPENED,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.611
WE CAN FINALLY WALK
HOME TOGETHER LIKE WE USED TO,

00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.345
AND ALL YOU GUYS TALK
ABOUT’S THAT STUPID GAME.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.611
I’M SORRY, CHI.

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:44.578
BUY ME SOME ENJIYA ICE CREAM
AND PROVE IT.

00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:47.645
I WANT EVERY JUMBO
PARFAIT ON THEIR MENU!

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:49.245
MMM...ICE CREAM? AGAIN?

00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.978
Chiyuri: PLUS A TIRAMISU
DORAYAKI.

00:04:50.978 --> 00:04:52.511
Taku:
OKAY.

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:55.111
Haru:
<i>HE’S RIGHT.</i>

00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:02.045
<i>EVEN SO...</i>

00:05:02.045 --> 00:05:04.111
<i>I HAVE TO TRY.</i>

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.511
<i>I WANT TO GET STRONGER.</i>

00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:10.311
Girl:
WELCOME HOME, BROTHER.

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:12.111
YEAH, THANKS.

00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:17.711
WAIT, WHAT?

00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.211
( giggles )

00:05:23.845 --> 00:05:25.711
SHE AN ANGEL?

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:26.811
( giggles )

00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:29.178
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF HEAVENLY VISION?

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.378
SORRY, I GOTTA GET
BACK IN THE KITCHEN.

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:34.311
I’M BAKING SOME
COOKIES RIGHT NOW.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:39.711
( humming )

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:46.045
SHE LOOKS WAY TOO REAL.
THIS CAN’T BE SOME

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.145
KIND OF FANTASY
OR DELUSION.

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:49.745
WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN...

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:52.145
THAT SOMEONE’S GONE AND TAMPERED
WITH MY NEURO-LINKER.

00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:54.778
AND THEY BUILT SOME SORT
OF VISUAL ILLUSION TRAP.

00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:59.978
WHO ARE YOU?
BECAUSE THERE’S NO WAY

00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:02.178
MY LITTLE SISTER
WOULD EVER BE THIS CUTE!

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:05.111
OW! WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS TO ME?

00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:08.411
( screams )

00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.511
NO WAY! SHE EVEN FEELS
LIKE SHE’S A REAL PERSON!

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.078
( grunts )

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:16.411
YOU’RE STILL HERE.

00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:18.378
OF COURSE
I’M STILL HERE, SILLY.

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:19.978
DON’T YOU REMEMBER ME?

00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:21.978
I’M TOMOKO SAITO
FROM NAKANO.

00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:24.545
SAITO FROM NAKANO?

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:27.311
YEP THAT’S ME,
I’M NOW IN THE 5TH GRADE.

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:29.645
FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD
YOU AND ME ARE
LIKE SECOND COUSINS

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:32.211
OR SOMETHING.
SORRY I KINDA BARGED IN,

00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:34.478
BUT IT’S REALLY
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:38.011
Woman: <i>ONE OF OUR RELATIVES</i>
<i>WILL BE STAYING WITH US</i>

00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:39.478
<i>FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS.</i>

00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:41.778
<i>SOMETHING TO DO WITH</i>
<i>A SUDDEN BUSINESS TRIP.</i>

00:06:41.778 --> 00:06:45.445
<i>AND I’M OFF TO SHANGHAI TODAY.</i>
<i>SO, PLEASE TAKE CARE</i>

00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:47.545
<i>OF HER FOR ME, OKAY?</i>

00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:50.578
( sighs )

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:56.345
I HOPE YOU DON’T MIND
THAT I USED YOUR KITCHEN

00:06:56.345 --> 00:06:58.745
WITHOUT ASKING,
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT BE HUNGRY,

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:01.311
SO, I WENT AND
WHIPPED UP A BATCH
OF THESE FOR YOU.

00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:04.311
THANKS.
THAT WAS NICE.

00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:05.645
GUESS I’LL TRY ONE.

00:07:05.645 --> 00:07:08.178
HEY, HOW DID YOU MANAGE
TO GET A KEY?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.111
WHEN I ASKED YOUR MOM
IF I COULD STAY,

00:07:10.111 --> 00:07:11.945
SHE ISSUED ME
AN INSTANCE KEY.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:15.311
HMMM...
THESE ARE GREAT!

00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:18.245
WOW! ARE THEY REALLY?
I’M SO GLAD.

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:22.445
HOLD ON, JUST DON’T MOVE.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.778
( giggles )

00:07:30.378 --> 00:07:34.278
ALL RIGHT. SO, UM...
W-WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

00:07:34.278 --> 00:07:35.811
PLAY SOME KIND
OF GAME MAYBE?

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.078
TO BE HONEST, I REALLY DON’T
PLAY A WHOLE LOT OF GAMES.

00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:42.478
I ACTUALLY DON’T LIKE
THE NEURO-LINKER ALL THAT MUCH.

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:44.911
THEN HOW ABOUT AN
OLD-FASHIONED 2-D MOVIE?

00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.578
NO THANKS. I’D RATHER
THE TWO OF JUST
TALKED INSTEAD.

00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:51.045
SO, WHAT’S IT LIKE BEING
IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL?

00:07:51.045 --> 00:07:52.578
I WANNA HEAR
ALL ABOUT IT!

00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:01.145
YA’ KNOW, I GOTTA SAY,
YOU’RE A REALLY FUNNY PERSON!

00:08:03.745 --> 00:08:06.978
IF I HAD A KID SISTER,
I WONDER IF THIS

00:08:06.978 --> 00:08:08.945
IS WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE.

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:11.611
SO WAIT, THAT MEANS WE’LL
BE LIVING UNDER THE SAME ROOF

00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:14.245
FOR THREE DAYS UNTIL MOM
COMES BACK FROM HER TRIP.

00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:23.345
NO WAY, GET REAL!
THIS JUST SEEMS WAY TOO PERFECT.

00:08:23.345 --> 00:08:26.245
IS THIS GIRL ACTUALLY
MY SECOND COUSIN?

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:34.645
THE SAITOS FROM NAKANO.

00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:40.711
NOTHIN’.

00:08:43.045 --> 00:08:45.745
NOT A SINGLE PHOTO
OF HER ANYWHERE.

00:08:47.245 --> 00:08:49.378
LET ME CHECK THIS OUT.

00:08:51.378 --> 00:08:53.245
Tomoko:
UM, ’SCUSE ME.

00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:55.411
HUH?
AH, CRAP!

00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.145
WOULD YOU MIND IF I CAME
IN THERE AND JOINED YOU?

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:00.111
AH, NO WAY!

00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:03.445
COME ON. YOU’VE BEEN
IN THERE FOR LIKE EVER NOW.

00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:05.511
I’M TIRED OF HAVING
TO WAIT SO LONG.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:08.311
OKAY. I’LL GET OUT NOW.
I’M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO WAIT.

00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:09.945
BUT JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE!

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:13.345
LOOK, WE’RE COUSINS.
IT’S REALLY NOT A BIG DEAL.

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.545
I DON’T KNOW.

00:09:14.545 --> 00:09:17.111
I KINDA THINK THAT IT IS
A BIG DEAL.

00:09:18.378 --> 00:09:19.611
HUH?

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:22.678
BUT PLEASE DON’T STARE
AT ME LIKE THAT

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:24.211
IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:38.611
TOMOKO?

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.711
YEP, THAT’S ME.
WHAT IS IT?

00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.478
OKAY, DROP THE ACT.
YOU’RE A NEW BURST
LINKER, AREN’T YOU?

00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:44.678
HUH?

00:09:44.678 --> 00:09:46.645
LOOK, YOU’VE GOT
TAN MARKS ON YOUR NECK.

00:09:48.278 --> 00:09:51.311
AND PLUS I JUST CAME
ACROSS A FEW OF
THE PHOTOS MY GRANDPA

00:09:51.311 --> 00:09:53.178
HAD POSTED ON
HIS HOME SERVER.

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:57.211
I’VE GOTTA ADMIT THOUGH...

00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.511
YOU’RE LIKE, TEN TIMES
CUTER THAN THE REAL ONE.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:06.745
( sighs )

00:10:09.378 --> 00:10:11.578
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU DID
ALL THAT DIGGING AROUND.

00:10:11.578 --> 00:10:13.511
YOU’RE WAY TOO SUSPICIOUS,
YA KNOW THAT?

00:10:13.511 --> 00:10:16.011
SO I GUESS YOU FORGED
THAT MAIL TO MY MOM,

00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:18.511
ASKING TO STAY HERE
WHILE YOU’RE PARENTS
ARE OUT OF TOWN.

00:10:18.511 --> 00:10:21.311
SO WHAT’S UP?
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING?
ARE YOU THINKING

00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:23.711
YOU’D TRY AND USE ME
TO HACK MY LEGION MASTER?

00:10:23.711 --> 00:10:26.106
DO WHAT?
WHAT’RE YOU BABBLING ABOUT?

00:10:26.106 --> 00:10:27.427
HEY, I DON’T BLAME YOU,
OKAY?

00:10:27.427 --> 00:10:29.060
I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WOULDN’T WANT TO TAKE ON

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.194
THE BLACK KING DIRECTLY.
IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD

00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:33.194
TO TAKE OUT BLACK LOTUS
IN A FAIR FIGHT.

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:35.094
BUT SNEAKING
AROUND LIKE THIS?

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.327
GO ON.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYIN’?

00:10:38.327 --> 00:10:41.127
JUST WHO DO YOU THINK
I CAN’T TAKE OUT
IN A FAIR FIGHT?

00:10:41.127 --> 00:10:44.660
WELL, I MEANT, IT’S JUST...
AFTER ALL YOU’RE--

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.260
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.

00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:50.327
YOU LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE
TO SAY AND YOU LISTEN GOOD.

00:10:50.327 --> 00:10:53.527
YOU’VE JUST INSULTED ME,
SCARLET RAIN,

00:10:53.527 --> 00:10:56.360
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
I’M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY!

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.527
( screaming )

00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:01.394
WATCH OUT!

00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:14.027
( grunting )

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.994
( screaming )

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.260
YOU’RE SO DEAD.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.127
SCARLET, HUH?
SO THAT MUST MEAN

00:11:37.127 --> 00:11:40.327
SHE’S A BURST LINKER
FROM THE RED LEGION.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.069
HARUYUKI?

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:51.169
TO WHAT DO I OWE THE PLEASURE
OF RECEIVING THIS CALL?

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.936
SORRY, I KNOW IT’S LATE.
BUT I’VE GOT A QUESTION

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:55.369
I REALLY NEED TO ASK YOU.

00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:57.136
WELL, THEN, WHAT IS IT?

00:11:57.136 --> 00:11:58.669
<i>HAVE YOU HEARD OF</i>
<i>A BURST LINKER THAT</i>

00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:01.769
<i>GOES BY THE NAME</i>
<i>SCARLET RAIN?</i>

00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:06.002
DID I SAY
SOMETHING WRONG?

00:12:06.002 --> 00:12:08.836
OH, RIGHT. I’VE ONLY MENTIONED
THEIR NICKNAMES TO YOU

00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:11.669
IN THE PAST,
NOT THEIR ACTUAL NAMES.

00:12:11.669 --> 00:12:13.936
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

00:12:13.936 --> 00:12:16.736
<i>YES, I KNOW</i>
<i>WHO SCARLET RAIN IS.</i>

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.302
<i>IT’S THE NAME OF</i>
<i>THE SECOND RED KING.</i>

00:12:19.302 --> 00:12:21.402
WHAT?

00:12:21.402 --> 00:12:24.069
( panting )

00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:28.169
HOLD ON. SO YOU’RE
THE RED KING?

00:12:28.169 --> 00:12:30.202
BURST LINK!

00:13:06.236 --> 00:13:09.102
UM, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
THE RED KING?

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:32.869
AH, CRAP.

00:13:45.136 --> 00:13:47.236
NO, I SHOULDN’T
RUN FROM THIS.

00:13:47.236 --> 00:13:49.669
RED SPECIALIZES
IN LONG-RANGE COMBAT.

00:13:49.669 --> 00:13:53.336
IF I WERE TO RUN AWAY RIGHT NOW
IT WOULD BE COMPLETE SUICIDE!

00:13:53.336 --> 00:13:56.369
SO, NOT GONNA RUN ARE YA?

00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:58.269
HOW VERY BRAVE!

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:01.069
BUT HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT I SAID?

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:03.169
ABOUT WHAT?

00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:08.402
ABOUT THE FACT THAT I AM SO
GONNA KILL YOU RIGHT NOW,

00:14:08.402 --> 00:14:10.602
YA FUCKIN’ PERVERT!

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:14.102
THAT WAS REALLY JUST
AN UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT!

00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:17.869
AND DON’T FORGET,
YOU’RE THE ONE WHO TRIED

00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:20.269
TO GET INTO MY BATH!
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!

00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:22.869
<i>FROM MY EXPERIENCE,</i>
<i>HEAVILY-ARMED OPPONENTS</i>

00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:25.302
<i>LIKE HER ALWAYS HAVE</i>
<i>A VULNERABLE SPOT.</i>

00:14:28.002 --> 00:14:30.102
<i>AND THAT’S THEIR BACK!</i>

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:32.736
<i>I’LL AIM FOR THE JOINTS</i>
<i>WHERE THE ARMOR IS THINNEST!</i>

00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:39.036
AH, THAT’S HOT!

00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:45.969
YEAH, I FORGOT.
I’M SILVER CROW!

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:48.969
A METAL COLOR!
FLAMES DON’T AFFECT ME!

00:14:48.969 --> 00:14:53.302
HA! YOU ARE SO GOIN’ DOWN!

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:56.569
IN YOUR DREAMS, ROOKIE!

00:14:56.569 --> 00:14:59.202
( laughs )

00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:01.136
AH!

00:15:01.136 --> 00:15:04.369
W-WAIT! H-HOLD ON!

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.536
YOU’RE SHOOTING AT ME INSIDE
MY OWN APARTMENT BUILDING!

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:09.536
ARE YOU CRAZY!

00:15:15.236 --> 00:15:16.769
( screaming )

00:15:39.302 --> 00:15:42.136
WHOA, SHE’S DESTROYED HERSELF
ALONG WITH THE BUILDING.

00:15:42.136 --> 00:15:43.969
NO MATTER HOW TANK-LIKE
HER AVATAR IS,

00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:45.669
THERE’S NO WAY IT
COULD SURVIVE THAT--

00:15:45.669 --> 00:15:47.636
Scarlet Rain:
<i>HEAT BLAST SATURATION!</i>

00:15:59.002 --> 00:16:00.969
Haru:
<i>HOLY CRAP!</i>

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:09.536
OH, HE’S FLYING, PERFECT.
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR A CHANCE

00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:11.936
TO TRY OUT
MY ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE.

00:16:14.602 --> 00:16:17.102
YEAH WELL, IF I WERE YOU,
I’D KEEP IN MIND THAT IT’S

00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:19.869
ALWAYS A SINGLE ROBOT WHO TAKES
DOWN THE GIANT BATTLESHIP!

00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:22.636
EXCEPT FOR WHEN THE PERSON
PILOTING THAT ROBOT

00:16:22.636 --> 00:16:25.469
IS SOME PATHETIC PERVERT.
YA DUMBASS!

00:16:25.469 --> 00:16:28.002
HAILSTORM DOMINATION!

00:16:36.702 --> 00:16:40.636
HERE GOES NOTHING!

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.836
I THINK I CAN SEE ’EM!

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:52.302
<i>SILVER CROW’S</i>
<i>ALL OR NOTHING KICK!</i>

00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:56.802
( screaming )

00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:21.469
LOOKS LIKE I WIN.
GIVE UP?

00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:24.469
YEAH, I SURRENDER.

00:17:24.469 --> 00:17:27.636
SO, WILL YOU LISTEN
TO MY REQUEST NOW?

00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:29.069
WHAT REQUEST?

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:32.136
I WANT TO MEET YOUR LEGION
MASTER IN REAL LIFE.

00:17:32.136 --> 00:17:35.736
THE TWO OF US,
IN THE FLESH.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.650
WELL, HARUYUKI.
GOOD MORNING.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.017
YEAH, AND GOOD MORNING
TO YOU TOO.

00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:53.350
UM, YOU LOOK VERY...

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.250
I MEAN,
YOU’RE SURE HERE EARLY.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.750
OF COURSE I AM.
IT’S EASIER
TO GET TO

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.483
THE SECOND-YEAR
CLASSROOMS FROM HERE.

00:17:59.483 --> 00:18:01.883
UM, YEAH, THAT’S TRUE.

00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:04.183
AND I PREFER WAITING
FOR YOU RATHER THAN HAVING

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.483
TO MAKE YOU WAIT FOR ME.
AND WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH

00:18:06.483 --> 00:18:08.383
THE ENTRANCE
I GET TO LOOK UP

00:18:08.383 --> 00:18:10.083
AND SEE YOU.
AND FOR THE REST OF THE DAY

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:12.517
I CHERISH THAT MOMENT
AT EVERY TURN.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.750
BY THE WAY,
THAT CALL LAST NIGHT?

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.617
WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT ANYWAY?

00:18:19.617 --> 00:18:21.783
HUH?
WELL, AT FIRST YOU HAD

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:24.017
MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT THE RED KING.

00:18:24.017 --> 00:18:27.283
OH, YEAH.
UM...

00:18:27.283 --> 00:18:29.850
WELL, ABOUT THAT...

00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:35.583
Haru: AND THAT’S
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:18:37.183 --> 00:18:39.683
Senpai:
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I’M DOING MY BEST

00:18:39.683 --> 00:18:41.317
NOT TO GIVE
YOU A LECTURE.

00:18:41.317 --> 00:18:43.917
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE FIGURED
OUT IT WAS HER MUCH SOONER.

00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:46.583
BUT I CAN SEE HOW SHE MAY
HAVE CAUGHT YOU OFF GUARD.

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.383
I CAN’T BELIEVE SHE WOULD
DO SOMETHING SO FOOLISH.

00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:51.450
A REAL LIFE HACK
IS VERY RECKLESS.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.117
YEAH, I THOUGHT
THE SAME THING.

00:18:53.117 --> 00:18:55.583
SO, WHY DOES SHE
WANT TO MEET WITH ME?

00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.583
DID SHE TELL YOU?
WHAT’S HER END GAME?

00:18:58.583 --> 00:19:02.017
SHE SAID SHE’D TELL
YOU ALL THAT WHEN YOU MEET.

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:03.383
WELL...

00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:13.383
HE’S MOVING.

00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:20.017
LOOK, YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER THIS A VALUABLE
LEARNING EXPERIENCE.

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:23.117
YEAH. I THINK I’VE LEARNED
ALL KINDS OF THINGS

00:19:23.117 --> 00:19:24.583
FROM THIS ENCOUNTER.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.983
YOU HAD A ONE-ON-ONE
BATTLE WITH A KING.

00:19:26.983 --> 00:19:29.117
AND NO MATTER HOW MANY
BURST POINTS YOU HAVE,

00:19:29.117 --> 00:19:30.750
THAT’S A FIGHT
YOU CAN’T BUY.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.917
SO TELL ME, WHAT WAS
THE SECOND RED KING LIKE?

00:19:33.917 --> 00:19:36.383
SHE’S INSANE!
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN

00:19:36.383 --> 00:19:37.850
WHAT SHE
DID TO CITY HALL!

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.050
SHE TOOK NEARLY HALF OF IT
OUT IN A SINGLE BLAST!

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.650
AND SHE REDUCED MY WHOLE
APARTMENT BUILDING TO RUBBLE.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.783
FROM WHAT I’VE
HEARD ABOUT HER,
SHE TOOK ALL

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:47.083
HER LEVEL-UP BONUSES
AND DIRECTED THEM EACH

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.917
TOWARD ONE THING,
HER LONG-RANGE FIRE POWER.

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:53.783
WHAT ABOUT THE RED KING?
DID SHE MOVE AT ALL
DURING YOUR BATTLE?

00:19:53.783 --> 00:19:58.517
MM-HMM, BUT ONLY ABOUT,
50 CENTIMETERS.

00:19:58.517 --> 00:20:02.350
REALLY?
THAT’S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.383
THE STRONGHOLD.
THE IMMOBILE FORTRESS.

00:20:05.383 --> 00:20:08.883
THAT’S ANOTHER NAME FOR HER.
NOT ’CAUSE SHE DOESN’T MOVE,

00:20:08.883 --> 00:20:10.583
’CAUSE SHE DOESN’T HAVE TO.

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.617
IF I’D KNOWN ALL THAT
ABOUT HER I PROBABLY WOULD

00:20:12.617 --> 00:20:14.517
JUST HAVE GIVEN UP
STRAIGHT FROM THE START.

00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:16.550
I THOUGHT THE NAME
FOR THE RED KING
WOULD BE STARTING

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.750
WITH THE WORD "RED,"
NOT "SCARLET."

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.517
AS I SAID ON THE PHONE,
YOU NEED TO STUDY MORE.

00:20:21.517 --> 00:20:23.450
IN THE HISTORY OF
ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.417
JUST ONE PERSON
HAS EVER USED RED
IN THEIR TITLE,

00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:29.350
AND THAT WAS RED RIDER.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.783
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:20:36.883 --> 00:20:38.917
Senpai:
<i>I BEHEADED THE RED KING.</i>

00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:41.917
<i>THE PERSON CLOSEST TO ME</i>
<i>CALLING FOR PEACE.</i>

00:20:41.917 --> 00:20:45.517
LOOK, SENPAI, I’M SORRY,
BUT WAS THE FIRST RED KING

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:48.383
SOMEONE SPECIAL TO YOU?

00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:53.117
NEVER MIND. I’M SORRY.
IT’S REALLY NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

00:20:53.117 --> 00:20:54.683
BOTH THAT CALL FROM ME
LAST NIGHT

00:20:54.683 --> 00:20:56.050
AND THAT QUESTION
I JUST ASKED.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.517
I REALLY WASN’T THINKING.
I’M SO SORRY.

00:20:58.517 --> 00:21:01.950
NO IT’S ALL RIGHT.
DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.983
I HAD THOUGHT THAT I’D FIGURED
THIS WHOLE THING OUT

00:21:03.983 --> 00:21:06.017
AND GOTTEN OVER IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:11.483
I HAD COME TO A CONCLUSION
ON THIS SUBJECT.

00:21:11.483 --> 00:21:14.483
THAT ALL OTHER BURST LINKERS
WERE MY ENEMIES.

00:21:14.483 --> 00:21:16.383
SO TO SUDDENLY
FEEL THIS WAY.

00:21:16.383 --> 00:21:19.050
WELL, IT’S COMPLETELY
RIDICULOUS.

00:21:24.517 --> 00:21:26.650
LOOK, YOU HAVE MY WORD.

00:21:30.717 --> 00:21:33.183
I WILL NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT
MAKES ME FIGHT AGAINST YOU.

00:21:33.183 --> 00:21:35.883
I PROMISE. I’LL NEVER
EVER BE YOUR ENEMY.

00:21:35.883 --> 00:21:39.450
YOU ARE MY GUARDIAN
AND I AM YOUR PROTEGE.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.850
THAT’S WHAT MATTERS
THE MOST BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.783
IT HAS TO!

00:21:53.283 --> 00:21:55.517
