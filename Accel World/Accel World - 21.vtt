WEBVTT

00:00:07.985 --> 00:00:10.352
<i>YOU'VE GOT MAIL.</i>

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.118
A VOTE?

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:16.952
CHOOSE A NICKNAME
FOR THAT CREEP ARITA?

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:28.352
(telephone rings )

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.285
<i>UH, HEY.</i>
<i>IT'S ME--HARUYUKI.</i>

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:33.752
HEY! HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHAT'S UP?

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.085
WELL, TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST,

00:00:36.218 --> 00:00:37.985
I HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:39.618
DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE
SOME TIME LATER TODAY

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:41.652
TO MEET UP WITH ME
AND TAKU IN PERSON?

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:42.985
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT.

00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:45.185
YOU KNOW IT'S
RAINING OUT, RIGHT?

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:46.985
BUT I DO HAVE
A HUGE CRAVING

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:48.418
FOR A BIG PIECE
OF CAKE...

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:50.352
WITH LOTS OF
STRAWBERRIES ON IT!

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:53.452
<i>YEAH, SURE! I'LL BUY YOU</i>
<i>WHATEVER YOU WANT, YUNIKO!</i>

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.552
JUST CALL ME NIKO,
SILLY!

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:57.618
I KNOW A SUPER-YUMMY
CAKE SHOP,

00:00:57.752 --> 00:00:59.818
SO WHY DON'T
THE THREE OF US
MEET THERE?

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:02.385
SEE YA SOON,
BIG BROTHER!

00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:06.218
(singing in Japanese )

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:40.921
SO HOW'D IT ALL GO?

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.755
DID YOU GET THE RED KING
TO AGREE TO MEET US?

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:46.121
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
HOW, BUT I DID.

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:49.321
JEEZ, LOOKS LIKE
THAT RUMOR IS SPREADING
LIKE WILDFIRE.

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:52.088
WELL, I HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.355
I KNOW THAT.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

00:02:54.488 --> 00:02:56.755
THAT SUGENO CALLED YOU IN
WITHOUT A SHRED
OF EVIDENCE.

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:58.655
NOMI PROBABLY
GAVE HIM MY NAME.

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:00.121
WHAT?NOMI?

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.721
I SHOULD TELL YOU
THE WHOLE STORY.

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:04.821
HUH?
FROM THE START...

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.621
THIS WHOLE THING
HAS BEEN ONE
GIANT TRAP

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:08.088
SET UP BY NOMI.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.755
AND I WALKED
RIGHT INTO IT.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:15.555
I SEE. SO THAT PHOTO
I SENT YOU

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:17.555
HAD A VIRUS IN IT.

00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:20.488
I'M SORRY, HARU.
I SHOULD'VE TOTALLY
CHECKED FOR THAT.

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.621
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
NO...

00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:24.455
I SHOULD'VE NOTICED
SOMETHING WAS STRANGE

00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.455
AS SOON AS I SAW
HOW BIG THAT FILE WAS.

00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:28.588
BUT I DIDN'T.

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.788
INSTEAD, I BARGE
INTO YOUR HOUSE

00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:32.688
WHEN YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH A REALLY HARD TIME

00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:34.821
AND STARTED
MOUTHING OFF TO YOU.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:36.455
AND TO MAKE THINGS
EVEN WORSE,

00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:38.421
I PUNCHED YOU.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:39.588
HARU...

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:41.655
UH...YEAH?

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.821
PLEASE, I WANT YOU
TO HIT ME.

00:03:43.955 --> 00:03:46.021
THERE'S REALLY
NO NEED FOR THAT.

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:48.521
IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:50.155
TAKU, WAIT!

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:52.155
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:53.988
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE
HITTING <i>ME</i> AGAIN.

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:55.188
HUH?

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.421
CHIYU, I'M SORRY.

00:03:57.555 --> 00:03:59.921
WHEN I FELL FOR THAT
VISUAL MASKING TRAP
OF HIS,

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:01.555
I RAN INTO
THE GIRLS' SHOWER

00:04:01.688 --> 00:04:03.288
THINKING IT WAS
THE GUYS'.

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:06.421
AND WHEN I DID,
I SAW CHIYU IN
THE SHOWER.

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:08.188
I'M SORRY.

00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.688
I SEE.
SO <i>THAT</i> EXPLAINS

00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:13.721
HOW SHE GOT INVOLVED
IN ALL THIS.

00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:16.588
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I KNOW I SHOULD'VE
TOLD YOU SOONER.

00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:19.655
LOOK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
WHATEVER YOU
HAPPENED TO SEE,

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:21.555
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

00:04:21.688 --> 00:04:23.855
OUT OF RESPECT FOR CHI.

00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:27.788
YOU'RE A TRUE
GENTLEMAN, TAKU.

00:04:29.588 --> 00:04:31.655
LONG TIME NO SEE,
BIG BROTHER.

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:33.455
YOU'RE STILL
AS ROUND AS EVER.

00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:37.188
SAME FOR YOU, TEACH.
YOU'RE STILL AS GLOOMY AS EVER.

00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.855
YAY! MY STRAWBERRY
LABYRINTH!

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:49.321
I GOT HERE EARLY
SO I WENT AHEAD AND ORDERED IT.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.455
OH, YOU'LL BE FINE WITH
A COUPLE OF COFFEES, RIGHT?

00:04:52.588 --> 00:04:54.088
UH...YEAH, SURE.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.288
AND TWO COFFEES
FOR THESE GUYS, PLEASE.

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:02.188
HA HA!

00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.588
AHH! MMM!

00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:07.188
HUH?

00:05:08.421 --> 00:05:09.755
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY!

00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:12.221
I KNOW THAT.
JEEZ, JUST KIDDING.

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:14.855
HERE YOU GO. AHH...

00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:16.421
AHH...

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:18.321
HA HA! I LIED.

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:19.921
AHEM.

00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:22.288
RIGHT. ANYWAY,
NIKO, LISTEN--

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.721
LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHY WE CAME HERE.

00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:28.121
(mumbling)
SURE. I'LL LISTEN FOR
TEN MORE STRAWBERRIES.

00:05:28.255 --> 00:05:30.455
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
THAT'S A FAIR TRADE,

00:05:30.588 --> 00:05:34.221
BUT...
WELL, TEACH HERE--
I MEAN TAKUMU--

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:36.421
THERE'S A TECHNIQUE
WE'D LIKE YOU TO
TRY AND TEACH HIM.

00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:40.321
CAN YOU SHOW HIM
HOW TO USE THE
INCARNATE SYSTEM?

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:45.921
UH...

00:05:47.088 --> 00:05:48.955
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
( gasps)

00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:51.388
WE'RE GONNA BORROW
THE BACK ROOM FOR A BIT.

00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:52.655
MM.

00:05:52.788 --> 00:05:54.521
Haru:UH, NIKO?

00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:56.721
HEY, WAIT UP!

00:05:59.321 --> 00:06:01.788
LISTEN, TURD-BRAIN!
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?

00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:04.055
BLABBING ABOUT INCARNATION
IN FUCKIN' PUBLIC?!

00:06:04.188 --> 00:06:06.988
(gasps)
I'M SO SORRY!

00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:11.055
OKAY, BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,
YOU LOSERS ARE GONNA TELL ME

00:06:11.188 --> 00:06:13.988
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.121
NOW, STOP STANDING THERE
AND START TALKING!

00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:28.255
I SEE--DUSK TAKER.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:31.121
SO IT'S A DUEL AVATAR
WITH ROBBING ABILITIES.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:33.555
TOSS IN THE FACT THAT
HE CAN USE INCARNATION,

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:35.321
AND I CAN SEE
WHY HE'D BE TOO MUCH

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:37.355
FOR THE TWO OF YOU
TO HANDLE BY YOURSELVES.

00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:39.788
YES, THAT IS
UNFORTUNATELY
THE CASE.

00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:41.888
WELL, I FEEL YOUR PAIN,
I REALLY DO.

00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:44.588
BUT, TO BE BLUNT,
THIS IS ANOTHER
LEGION'S PROBLEM.

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.255
IN FACT, IF I WERE
TO JUST IGNORE IT

00:06:46.388 --> 00:06:48.655
AND LET THIS BE
THE DOWNFALL OF
NEGA NEBULOUS,

00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:50.621
THAT WORKS OUT
EVEN BETTER FOR ME.

00:06:50.755 --> 00:06:52.921
UH...
BUT IF I DID THAT...

00:06:53.055 --> 00:06:54.721
YOU'D GET ALL SAD-FACED
AND SAY,

00:06:54.855 --> 00:06:56.421
"WHAT?! OH, COME ON!

00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:58.688
"YOU CAME TO US WHEN
YOU HAD TROUBLE WITH
YOUR LEGION

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.588
AND WE HELPED YOU OUT!
YOU OWE US NOW!"

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.388
OR SOME SHIT LIKE THAT!
LOOK...

00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.121
(sighs)

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:07.921
I KNEW ASKING FOR HELP
FROM YOU GUYS

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:09.955
WAS GONNA COME BACK
AND BITE ME ON THE ASS.

00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:13.055
BUT EVEN STILL,
ASKING ME TO TEACH YOU
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM--

00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:16.155
THAT'S SURE ONE HELL OF
A PRICEY PAYBACK
YOU'RE WANTING.

00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:18.455
SO ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'RE WILLING TO
HELP US?!

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:20.021
DAMN IT.
IF I'D KNOWN

00:07:20.155 --> 00:07:21.821
THIS WAS WHAT YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA ASK FOR,

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.455
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
THE ROYAL PALACE,

00:07:23.588 --> 00:07:25.221
NOT THE STRAWBERRY
LABYRINTH.

00:07:25.355 --> 00:07:27.388
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:30.855
UHH!AAH! WHAT THE HELL
IS WITH YOU AND MY FEET?!

00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:34.255
YOU'RE SUCH
A FUCKING PERVERT!

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.288
ALL RIGHT,
PLUG THIS IN.

00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:38.955
WELL, WHAT IS IT?
RELAX.

00:07:39.088 --> 00:07:40.755
IT'S NOT SOME KIND OF TRAP.
JUST TRUST ME.

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:42.888
THIS ROOM BLOCKS OUT
ALL RADIO WAVES,

00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:44.721
SO IF WE WANT TO CONNECT
TO THE GLOBAL NET,

00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:47.188
WE HAVE TO USE
A CABLE.

00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:50.755
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO MY DORM ROOM BY 6:00,

00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:53.521
SO THAT MEANS I'VE ONLY
GOT ABOUT 30 MINUTES

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:54.921
THAT I CAN SPEND
WITH YOU GUYS.

00:07:55.055 --> 00:07:56.688
THAT'LL GIVE US 500 HOURS

00:07:56.821 --> 00:07:59.221
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD--
ABOUT 20 DAYS.

00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:01.455
IN THAT TIME, YOU'LL LEARN
SOME INCARNATE SKILLS

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:03.155
YOU CAN USE
IN ACTUAL BATTLES.

00:08:03.288 --> 00:08:05.821
THANKS,
BUT I'M ONLY GOING
TO NEED A WEEK.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:07.288
THAT SHOULD BE
ENOUGH.

00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.888
WELL, GET A LOAD OF YOU
THERE, TEACH.

00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:11.821
I THINK IT'S TIME WE TEST

00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:14.355
JUST HOW STRONG THAT RESOLVE
OF YOURS ACTUALLY IS.

00:08:14.488 --> 00:08:16.388
YOU GUYS READY?

00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.721
MM-HMM.

00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:21.155
All:UNLIMITED BURST!

00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:35.955
(gasps)

00:08:36.088 --> 00:08:39.488
CRAP, IT'S THE
ICE AND SNOW STAGE.

00:08:39.621 --> 00:08:41.055
I HATE THIS ONE.

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:43.155
HEY, CROW, DOES THAT
METAL ARMOR OF YOURS

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:44.855
HAVE ANY RESISTANCE
TO THE COLD?

00:08:44.988 --> 00:08:48.288
UH...YEAH, SORT OF.

00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:50.321
NOT FAIR!

00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.921
(grunts)

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:54.888
YAAAH!

00:08:55.021 --> 00:08:56.821
(screaming)

00:08:56.955 --> 00:08:59.121
I MEANT IT ONLY
HAS RESISTANCE TO
THE COLD DAMAGES!

00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:02.155
BUT I STILL FEEL THE COLD!
YIKES, I'M FREEZING!

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:03.955
AHEM!

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:07.721
OKAY, I'LL START
BY GIVING YOU THE BASIC GIST

00:09:07.855 --> 00:09:09.355
OF THE INCARNATE SKILLS.

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:10.921
YES, PLEASE!
YES, PLEASE!

00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:13.021
FIRST OFF,
EVEN IF YOU USE IT,

00:09:13.155 --> 00:09:15.955
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE
WON'T GO DOWN.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:17.955
SECONDLY, AN ATTACK
USING INCARNATION

00:09:18.088 --> 00:09:21.821
CAN ONLY BE DEFENDED
BY INCARNATION--
NO EXCEPTIONS.

00:09:21.955 --> 00:09:25.088
AND LASTLY...
THEY SHINE.

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:26.688
THEY SHINE?

00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:28.588
CROW, SHOW US
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:30.121
LET ME SEE THE POWER

00:09:30.255 --> 00:09:32.121
YOU'VE MANAGED TO
PUT TOGETHER SO FAR.

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:34.321
UH...OKAY.

00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:45.221
MY HAND IS A SWORD...

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.655
A SWORD THAT'S AS FAST
AS THE SPEED OF LIGHT

00:09:47.788 --> 00:09:49.621
AND CAN CUT
THROUGH ANYTHING!

00:09:59.155 --> 00:10:01.388
WELL, THAT'S BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:05.055
PRETTY IMPRESSIVE...
FOR A FRIGGIN' NOOB.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.321
NOOB?!

00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:11.355
(gasps)

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:13.488
FOR AN INCARNATION
THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO USE IN BATTLE,

00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.855
IT SHOULD SHINE
LIKE THIS.

00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:18.221
WE CALL THIS
THE OVER RAY.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.255
THERE ARE FOUR BASIC
INCARNATE SKILLS,

00:10:24.388 --> 00:10:27.055
AND THAT WAS
THE FIRST OF THEM--
RANGE ENHANCEMENT.

00:10:27.188 --> 00:10:28.888
WOW!

00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.421
AND THIS IS
THE SECOND ONE--

00:10:31.555 --> 00:10:33.721
SPEED ENHANCEMENT.

00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:42.455
GOT IT?

00:10:42.588 --> 00:10:43.988
WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD
AND FOURTH ONE?

00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.488
ATTACK ENHANCEMENT
AND ARMOR ENHANCEMENT--

00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:48.288
THAT'S THE OTHER TWO.

00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:51.688
BUT...I'M NOT ABLE TO USE
EITHER OF THOSE ABILITIES.

00:10:51.821 --> 00:10:53.588
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU CAN'T USE THEM?

00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:54.988
YOU'RE A KING.

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:58.555
YOU SEE,
I CAN'T USE THOSE MOVES

00:10:58.688 --> 00:11:01.855
BECAUSE I KNOW
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

00:11:01.988 --> 00:11:04.255
THE REAL WORLD SCARES ME.

00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:06.021
THE CLOSER I GET TO IT,

00:11:06.155 --> 00:11:08.655
THE MORE CHANCES I GIVE IT
TO FIND WAYS TO HURT ME.

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:10.921
SO I KEEP MY DISTANCE.

00:11:11.055 --> 00:11:13.621
IT WAS THAT FEAR
AND THOSE PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS

00:11:13.755 --> 00:11:15.488
THAT CREATED SCARLET RAIN.

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:16.955
NIKO...

00:11:17.088 --> 00:11:19.821
SO THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T USE

00:11:19.955 --> 00:11:21.621
THE OTHER TWO ASPECTS
OF INCARNATION

00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:24.721
TO STRENGTHEN MY AVATAR'S
OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE POWERS.

00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:26.688
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE SAYING

00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.755
THE TYPE OF INCARNATE
SKILLS YOU CAN ACQUIRE

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:30.621
AREN'T TOTALLY
DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE

00:11:30.755 --> 00:11:32.855
OF YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL
DUAL AVATAR.

00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:35.888
EXACTLY. INCARNATION
IS MEANT TO BE USED

00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.888
FOR CONFRONTING
YOUR OWN WEAKNESSES,

00:11:38.021 --> 00:11:39.755
NOT FOR DEFEATING ENEMIES.

00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:41.555
THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOULD NEVER USE

00:11:41.688 --> 00:11:43.088
AN INCARNATE SKILL
AGAINST AN ENEMY

00:11:43.221 --> 00:11:45.688
UNLESS THEY USE IT
ON YOU FIRST. GOT THAT?

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:47.221
GOT IT.
GOT IT.

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:50.221
GOOD. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN YOUR TRAINING.

00:11:50.355 --> 00:11:52.621
PILE, WHAT TYPE
OF AVATAR ARE YOU--

00:11:52.755 --> 00:11:54.521
CLOSE-RANGE OR LONG-RANGE?

00:11:54.655 --> 00:11:57.588
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
CLOSE-RANGE.

00:11:57.721 --> 00:11:59.488
ALL BLUE-COLOR
TYPES ARE.

00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.221
AND HIS IS EVEN
SUPER-VIVID.

00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:03.088
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT AT FIRST, TOO.

00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.655
BUT LOOK AT HIS
ENHANCED ARMAMENT.

00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:08.755
OH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:13.221
I HAD A FEELING
IT MIGHT COME TO THIS.

00:12:13.355 --> 00:12:15.755
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO LEARN INCARNATION,

00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:19.155
I'LL TO FACE MY
PSYCHOLOGICAL SCARS HEAD-ON.

00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:21.688
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL STEP OUT, THEN.

00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:24.888
NO, DON'T.
THIS IS SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO HEAR.

00:12:25.021 --> 00:12:27.588
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
A LONG TIME AGO.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.133
CYAN PILE IS FUNDAMENTALLY
A CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER.

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:42.433
AND YET IT CAME EQUIPPED
WITH THIS LONG-RANGE
TYPE WEAPON.

00:12:42.567 --> 00:12:45.567
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS
BECAUSE IT'S MOST LIKELY

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.633
AN EXPRESSION OF MY FEAR.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.400
WHAT FEAR?

00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:52.100
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:54.300
FROM THE THIRD GRADE
TO THE FIFTH GRADE,

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:56.233
I WAS BULLIED
ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:57.733
(gasps)

00:12:57.867 --> 00:12:59.633
FOR WHATEVER REASON,

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:01.433
THE OLDER STUDENTS
IN MY KENDO CLASS

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:03.767
SINGLED ME OUT
AND DECIDED TO PICK ON ME.

00:13:05.167 --> 00:13:07.133
THEY USED ME
AS THEIR PRACTICE DUMMY,

00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:10.200
STRIKING AT MY THROAT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:11.900
I'VE STILL GOT
A SCAR FORM IT.

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:15.567
TAKU, I HAD NO IDEA.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.300
THIS PILE DRIVER
IS PROBABLY THE RESULT

00:13:19.433 --> 00:13:21.133
OF BEING JABBED SO MUCH--

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:23.200
A MANIFESTATION
OF MY FEAR AND ANGER.

00:13:23.333 --> 00:13:25.233
ALL I WANTED TO DO
BACK THEN

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:26.933
WAS TO TAKE AN IRON SPIKE

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:30.400
AND SKEWER EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF THOSE BULLIES.

00:13:30.533 --> 00:13:32.100
SO, RED KING,

00:13:32.233 --> 00:13:34.267
EVEN THOUGH MY AVATAR
IS A CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.033
IT WAS CREATED
WITH A PIERCING WEAPON
INSTEAD OF A BLADE.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:38.733
AND THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:41.800
WELL, NOW I UNDERSTAND
YOUR SCARS.

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:43.567
IF YOU CAN
OVERCOME THAT FEAR,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.500
THEN YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO MASTER

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:47.400
THE ATTACK ENHANCEMENT
ABILITY...

00:13:47.533 --> 00:13:49.500
BECOMING A TRUE
CLOSE-RANGE FIGHTER.

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:51.000
GOT IT.

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:52.800
ALL RIGHT,
THE TEACH AND ME

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.700
ARE GONNA START THE
ACTUAL TRAINING NOW.

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:57.567
UH, OKAY. I GUESS
I'LL DIVE OUT, THEN.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.500
I'LL START DOING
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING

00:13:59.633 --> 00:14:01.200
TO SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT
HOW DUSK TAKER

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.800
KEEPS HIS NAME
OFF THE MATCHING LIST.

00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:05.533
HEY, THANK YOU, HARU.

00:14:08.667 --> 00:14:11.033
WAIT, I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU
ONE MORE KEY

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:12.767
TO USING
INCARNATION.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.367
THAT RANGE
ENHANCEMENT ABILITY
YOU USED EARLIER--

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.167
DID YOU GIVE
A NAME TO IT?

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.500
UH, A NAME?

00:14:18.633 --> 00:14:20.200
ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT ASPECTS

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:21.833
TO USING
INCARNATE SKILLS

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:24.033
IS HOW SOLIDLY
AND QUICKLY YOU CAN
VISUALIZE IT.

00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:25.700
GIVE IT
A NAME FIRST.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:27.333
THEN USE THAT NAME
AS A TRIGGER.

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.667
WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE--THINK!

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.300
UM...OKAY.

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:33.567
WELL, HOW ABOUT...
LASER SWORD?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.800
UGH!THAT'S
SO FUCKING LAME!

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:38.233
ALL RIGHT, THEN WHY
DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT
YOU NAMED <i>YOUR</i> MOVE?

00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:40.633
RIGHT. LIKE I'D
DO THAT, DUMBASS.

00:14:45.867 --> 00:14:47.633
HUH?

00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:52.833
GOOD LUCK, TAKU.

00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:54.200
THIS WAY. NOW.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:56.000
UH...OH, SORRY.

00:14:56.133 --> 00:14:57.400
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO LEAVE ANYWAY.

00:14:57.533 --> 00:14:59.167
WE'LL GO OUT THE BACK.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.233
JUST FOLLOW ME...
SILVER CROW.

00:15:01.367 --> 00:15:03.967
WHAT?!
YOU KNOW MY NAME?!

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.433
THERE'S NO USE
IN RUNNING.

00:15:05.567 --> 00:15:08.067
IT'S TOO LATE ANYWAY.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.567
SCARLET RAIN TOLD ME
TO HELP YOU WITH
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.467
MY NAME
IS BLOOD LEOPARD.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.200
BUT IF YOU WANT,
JUST CALL ME LEOPARD,
NOT BLOOD.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:19.733
AND IF YOU MUST
SHORTEN THAT,

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:21.233
"PARD", NOT "LEOPA".

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:22.867
WAIT! HOLD ON!
GIVE ME A SEC!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.700
SO THIS ISN'T JUST
SOME ORDINARY CAKE SHOP.

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:28.500
IT'S RED LEGION'S
PROMINENCE, THEIR BASE.

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:31.533
AND THIS WAITRESS...
IS A BURST LINKER?

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:33.600
I GUESS THAT
MAKES SENSE NOW.

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:35.900
SHE DID SEEM KIND OF RUDE
FOR A WAITRESS.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:37.567
IT'S BEEN TEN SECONDS.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.200
YOU CAN CONTINUE THINKING
WHILE WE'RE MOVING.

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.167
(grunting)

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.833
JUST SO WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE,

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:45.167
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT MY MASTER
HAS TOLD ME.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.733
THERE'S
A BURST LINKER

00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:48.533
WHO DOESN'T APPEAR
ON THE MATCHING LIST,

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:50.933
EVEN WHEN
HE'S CONNECTED TO
THE LOCAL NETWORK.

00:15:51.067 --> 00:15:52.300
AND WHAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO DO

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:54.233
IS FIND OUT HOW HE
DOES IT, CORRECT?

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.333
YEAH, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

00:15:56.467 --> 00:15:58.667
I'VE HEARD A FEW
RUMORS RECENTLY

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.000
OF INTRUDER BARGING IN
ON LOCAL NETWORKS.

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:03.000
ANY IDEA WHO'S
BEHIND IT?

00:16:03.133 --> 00:16:04.733
THOSE DETAILS
ARE UNCLEAR,

00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:07.167
BUT THEY'VE BEEN
BREAKING INTO
THIS ONE NETWORK.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.867
WHICH NETWORK
WOULD THAT BE?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.500
AKIHABARA.

00:16:10.633 --> 00:16:14.033
AKIHABARA?
THAT'S THE YELLOW
LEGION'S TERRITORY.

00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:15.800
YES, WE'LL
GO THERE NOW.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.800
WHOA!

00:16:18.933 --> 00:16:21.367
UHH!HUH?

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.833
HURRY UP AND GET ON.

00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:28.367
NO WAY. I MEAN,
IT'S JUST THAT I--

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.567
START.
(engine starts )

00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:35.400
(grunting)

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:38.067
ARE YOU
REALLY GONNA GO
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.700
CHANGING WOULD BE
A WASTE OF TIME.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:41.633
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SHOP?

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:44.367
MY SHIFT ENDED AT 5:00.
ARE WE DONE WITH
THE QUESTIONS?

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.367
UH, YEAH.
OKAY.

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.200
YOU SHOULD HOLD ON.

00:16:54.067 --> 00:16:58.233
AAH!AAAAAAH!

00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:01.300
AAAAAAH!

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:04.433
DON'T RUN AWAY!
I'VE DEFUSED THEM!

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:07.000
SO JUST FACE THEM HEAD-ON!
THIS WON'T GO ANYWHERE

00:17:07.133 --> 00:17:09.800
UNTIL YOU'VE LEARNED
TO CONQUER YOUR FEARS!

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.167
OKAY!

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.533
AAAAH!

00:17:22.233 --> 00:17:23.967
YOU WANT TO JUST
GIVE UP HERE?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.767
NO. ONE MORE TIME...
PLEASE.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.233
THAT'S THE SPIRIT.
HERE IT COMES!

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.133
I CAN'T RUN AWAY.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:39.033
HARU MANAGED
TO DO IT BY HIMSELF.

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:40.933
HE GOT STRONGER.

00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:43.467
AND SO CAN I!

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.200
UM, WE REALLY KIND OF
STAND OUT RIGHT NOW.

00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.300
SO?

00:17:58.433 --> 00:18:01.400
SO IF WE CHARGE INTO
THE YELLOW LEGION'S
STRONGHOLD LIKE THIS,

00:18:01.533 --> 00:18:03.600
WE RISK DRAWING
LOTS OF ATTENTION.

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:06.133
N.P. WE'LL BLEND IN
JUST FINE.

00:18:06.267 --> 00:18:08.933
HUH?

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:14.333
OH, I GET IT.

00:18:25.433 --> 00:18:27.567
THIS WAY.
UHH!

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.333
( <i>video game sound effects</i> )

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.733
IS THIS FOR REAL?!

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:40.667
<i>YOU WIN!</i>

00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:45.100
OH, YEAH!

00:18:45.233 --> 00:18:47.067
WHATEVER.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.333
WOW! I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
THIS IS AN ACTUAL ARCADE!

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:52.967
WITH ALL THE OLD-SCHOOL
ARCADE GAMES AND EVERYTHING!

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.167
THIS IS AMAZING!

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.433
AWW. I DON'T HAVE
MUCH REAL MONEY--

00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:00.067
NOT EVEN 100 YEN.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.067
NOT IMPORTANT.
BUT WAIT--

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.167
(grunting)

00:19:07.933 --> 00:19:10.200
SO, UM, WHERE
ARE WE GOING?

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:11.933
A DIVE CAFE.

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.267
(ding)

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.433
THERE'S ONLY ONE CHAIR.

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:26.900
THEY DIDN'T HAVE

SOME RUDE LITTLE TWERP
TURNED UP.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.500
AND WITHOUT EVEN
REGISTERING TO FIGHT,

00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:47.200
HE STARTED CHALLENGING
OPPONENTS

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:49.100
THAT WERE OBVIOUS
EASY WINS FOR HIM.

00:21:49.233 --> 00:21:50.933

HE WAS CONNECTED

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.700
HIS NAME DIDN'T SHOW UP
ANYWHERE ON THE MATCHING LIST.

IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO STOP THIS GUY,
