00:00:07.737 --> 00:00:10.137
I’M GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOME WINGS:

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.103
MY ENHANCED ARMAMENT,
GALE THRUSTER.

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:17.070
I’M SURE YOU’LL BE ABLE
TO USE THOSE WINGS

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.403

I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED.

I DID SOMETHING REALLY FOOLISH,

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:26.637
AND AS A RESULT,
I LOST A FRIEND.

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:31.037
THAT’S WHY I DON’T EVER
WANT YOU TO MAKE THAT SAME
KIND OF MISTAKE.

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:35.003
REALIZE WHAT’S TRULY IMPORTANT
TO YOU AND FIGHT FOR IT.

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.070
FIGHT...FOR WHAT’S
TRULY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:42.037
I WILL!
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:44.903
OKAY, MISS RAKER, I WON’T
FORGET WHAT YOU TAUGHT ME.

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:46.803
AND SOON I’M GONNA FLY AGAIN
WITH MY OWN POWER.

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:50.203
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
I’LL COME BACK
AND RETURN YOUR WINGS TO YOU.

IF YOU CUT OFF HIS TENTACLES,
THEY’LL JUST GROW BACK!

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.975
AND THAT BLADE ON HIS
RIGHT ARM IS SUPER SHARP!

00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:36.108
( scoffs )

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:39.141
( grunts )

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:45.508
( yelling )

00:09:47.908 --> 00:09:49.041
( grunts )

00:09:58.541 --> 00:09:59.508
TAKU!

00:10:12.863 --> 00:10:14.130
GAME OVER, NOMI.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.396
YOU’VE JUST LOST.

00:10:15.396 --> 00:10:16.530
REALLY?

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.263
AND JUST HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

00:10:18.263 --> 00:10:20.463
YOU’RE BUILT FOR SPEED,
NOT STRENGTH.

00:10:20.463 --> 00:10:22.963
YOU CAN’T BREAK THE WALLS
HERE IN THE PURGATORY STAGE.

00:10:22.963 --> 00:10:24.930
AND WITH THE ONLY EXIT
BEING BEHIND ME,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.496
YOU HAVE NO CHANCE OF WINNING.

00:10:26.496 --> 00:10:29.496
SO, UNLESS YOU WANT ME
POPPING UP LIKE THIS

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:31.063
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A TEST,

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:32.263
YOU’LL RETURN THE WINGS

00:10:32.263 --> 00:10:34.063
THAT YOU STOLE
FROM SILVER CROW.

00:10:34.063 --> 00:10:37.196
DO THAT, AND I’LL
LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR GOOD.

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:39.430
YOU’RE RIGHT.
GETTING PAST YOU

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.263
<i>WILL</i> BE KIND OF TRICKY.

00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:44.330
RETRACT ALL WEAPONS.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.196
( Haru gasps )
NO, I’M NOT SURRENDERING,
YOU IDIOT.

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:48.996
I JUST NEED BOTH HANDS
TO BE FREE

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.063
IN ORDER TO USE
MY SECRET MOVE.

00:10:51.063 --> 00:10:52.563
YOUR WHAT?!
ALTHOUGH...

00:10:52.563 --> 00:10:55.063
I WAS HOPING I DIDN’T
HAVE TO RESORT TO THIS.

00:10:55.063 --> 00:10:57.363
YOU SEE, I’M NOT A FAN
OF HAVING TO CALL OUT

00:10:57.363 --> 00:10:59.363
THE NAME OF MY MOVES.

00:10:59.363 --> 00:11:00.463
BUT, OH WELL.

00:11:00.463 --> 00:11:02.063
I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:06.396
TAKE, GET, GRAB, ERASE.

00:11:06.396 --> 00:11:08.630
TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.396
( gasps )
WHAT IS THAT?!

00:11:10.396 --> 00:11:12.163
A SPECIAL MOVE?

00:11:12.163 --> 00:11:13.863
NO--WAIT.

00:11:13.863 --> 00:11:15.663
IT CAN’T BE.
HIS SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE

00:11:15.663 --> 00:11:16.663
ISN’T GOING DOWN.

00:11:16.663 --> 00:11:18.663
SO THEN, WHAT IS IT?

00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:19.930
( gasps )

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.863
<i>OVERRIDING THE WORLD.</i>

00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:25.330
<i>IN OTHER WORDS,</i>
<i>YOUR WILL RESHAPES REALITY.</i>

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.296
TAKE, TAKE, TAKE, TAKE...
Haru: OH, NO!

00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:30.696
TAKU!
FORGET ABOUT MY WINGS!

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:32.963
FINISH HIM NOW!

00:11:32.963 --> 00:11:35.330
LIGHTNING CYAN SPIKE!

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:39.796
WHAT?!
( gasps )

00:11:41.263 --> 00:11:42.463
( grunting )

00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:44.896
( Taku groans )

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.030
( groans, gasps )

00:11:50.496 --> 00:11:52.296
( yells )

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:54.430
( grunting )

00:11:56.263 --> 00:11:58.396
WHAT WAS THAT
YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER,

00:11:58.396 --> 00:11:59.530
MAYUZUMI SENPAI?

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.763
SOMETHING ABOUT ME
NOT HAVING THE STRENGTH

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:04.063
TO BREAK THE WALLS
IN THIS STAGE?

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:13.563
TO BE HONEST, I WAS HOPING
TO AVOID SHOWING YOU THIS.

00:12:13.563 --> 00:12:15.063
Nomi: BUT IT DOESN’T MATTER.

00:12:15.063 --> 00:12:17.530
YOU WON’T UNDERSTAND IT,
ANYWAY.
( gasps )

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.063
THE LOGIC BEHIND THIS TECHNIQUE

00:12:19.063 --> 00:12:20.363
IS KNOWN BY THE SIX--

00:12:20.363 --> 00:12:21.796
OR RATHER, THE SEVEN KINGS

00:12:21.796 --> 00:12:23.130
AND THEIR CLOSES AIDES.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.530
AND BY US.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.963
IT’S THE INCARNATE SYSTEM!

00:12:27.963 --> 00:12:30.963
BUT HEY, YOU’RE A BRIGHT GUY.

00:12:30.963 --> 00:12:32.596
NOW THAT YOU’VE EXPERIENCED

00:12:32.596 --> 00:12:35.496
THE HUGE DIFFERENCE
IN OUR SKILL LEVEL FIRSTHAND,

00:12:35.496 --> 00:12:37.563
( grunts softly )
I’M SURE YOU’LL
HAVE NO PROBLEM

00:12:37.563 --> 00:12:40.196
UNDERSTANDING THAT FOR THE REST
OF YOUR TIME AT THIS SCHOOL,

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:42.163
YOU’RE GONNA SERVE ME
LIKE A DOG.

00:12:42.163 --> 00:12:44.230
THE FACT IS...
THE TWO OF YOU

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.796
HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE!
( Taku screaming )

00:12:46.796 --> 00:12:47.930
( grunts )

00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:50.296
I DON’T GET IT.

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.296
HOW DID NOMI FIND OUT
ABOUT THE INCARNATE SYSTEM?

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:53.830
I MEAN, IT’S NOT SOMETHING

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.796
YOU CAN JUST FIGURE OUT
ON YOUR OWN.

00:12:55.796 --> 00:12:58.530
( Taku groaning loudly )
( gasps )

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.230
( groaning )

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.930
( gasps )
Nomi:
WE’VE GOT 500 SECONDS LEFT.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.530
HMM. YOU HELD OUT LONGER
THAN I EXPECTED,

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.096
MAYUZUMI SENPAI.

00:13:08.096 --> 00:13:10.863
GUESS YOU’RE BETTER AT THIS
THAN YOU ARE AT KENDO.

00:13:10.863 --> 00:13:13.130
BUT TAKING THOSE
1.3 SECONDS FROM ME

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.963
IN REAL LIFE IS STILL
GONNA COST YA.

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.596
SO IT’S TIME TO PAY UP
( groaning )

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:18.963
WITH A LITTLE
PAIN AND SHAME,

00:13:18.963 --> 00:13:21.430
AND OF COURSE,
YOUR BURST POINTS.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.530
NOMI, WAIT!
HUH?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.796
JUST HEAR ME OUT!

00:13:24.796 --> 00:13:26.430
TAKU USED UP A TON
OF HIS POINTS

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.130
SO HE COULD CHALLENGE YOU
TO THIS DUEL.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.730
SO PLEASE, TAKE THEM
FROM ME INSTEAD!

00:13:31.796 --> 00:13:33.096
( grunts )

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:35.796
( groans )

00:13:35.796 --> 00:13:37.063
( sighs )

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.963
COME ON, NOMI.

00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:40.796
I’M BEGGING YOU.

00:13:41.663 --> 00:13:43.196
( whimpering)

00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:46.030
OH, MY GOD!

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.630
YOU’RE PATHETIC!

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.496
IN, LIKE, EVERY MEANING
OF THE WORD,

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.496
YOU’RE PATHETIC.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.730
EVEN A GUY LIKE ME

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.730
THINKS THIS IS SOMETHING

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.730
YOU SHOULD NEVER DO

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.030
ON A BATTLEFIELD.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.663
I DON’T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK!

00:13:56.663 --> 00:13:59.463
I’LL GIVE YOU NEXT WEEK’S
POINTS AS WELL!

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:01.263
SO PLEASE!

00:14:01.263 --> 00:14:02.530
OKAY, FINE.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.696
I’LL DO IT.

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:05.296
YOU KNOW, YOU REMIND ME

00:14:05.296 --> 00:14:07.196
OF THE ROLLIE POLLIES
I USED TO LOVE TORTURING

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:09.163
IN THE GARDEN
AS A LITTLE KID.

00:14:09.163 --> 00:14:11.663
BUT I GUESS IT’S
ACTIONS LIKE THIS

00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:13.663
THAT ALLOWED YOU
TO GET THAT FLYING ABILITY

00:14:13.663 --> 00:14:15.196
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:14:16.896 --> 00:14:19.163
( grunting softly )

00:14:20.563 --> 00:14:22.730
( grunts )

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.930
WILL YOU HURRY UP,
MAYUZUMI SENPAI?

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.930
OH, DON’T TELL ME THAT YOU’RE
TOO WEAK TO EVEN MOVE A FINGER.

00:14:29.863 --> 00:14:31.030
( grunts softly )

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:39.563
HIT YES, TAKU.

00:14:39.563 --> 00:14:40.730
COME ON.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.930
I HAVEN’T GIVEN UP YET.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.963
Haru: IF YOU SWITCH
TO BATTLE ROYALE MODE,

00:14:44.963 --> 00:14:46.030
I CAN FIGHT HIM!

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.930
THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT!

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.663
SO PLEASE, TAKU!

00:14:49.663 --> 00:14:51.063
HIT "YES"!

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.930
THANK YOU, TAKU.

00:15:04.796 --> 00:15:06.663
ALL RIGHT, NOMI,

00:15:06.663 --> 00:15:08.763
LET’S DO THIS!

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:12.830
( grunts )

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.196
( grunts )

00:15:17.263 --> 00:15:18.263
( grunts loudly )

00:15:18.263 --> 00:15:19.463
( yelling )

00:15:21.663 --> 00:15:23.396
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:24.630
DAMN DOG!

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.663
SO WHEN DID YOU FIGURE OUT

00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:26.896
HOW TO USE THIS TRICK?

00:15:26.896 --> 00:15:28.396
COME ON,

00:15:28.396 --> 00:15:29.563
VISUALIZE IT.

00:15:29.563 --> 00:15:30.696
FASTER...

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.363
THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT!

00:15:33.896 --> 00:15:35.030
Kuroyukihime: <i>THAT’S RIGHT...</i>

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.263
<i>YOU</i> ARE <i>FAST.</i>

00:15:37.263 --> 00:15:38.930
<i>THE FASTEST.</i>

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.496
( yelling )

00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:50.330
WELL, WELL, WELL.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.063
AN INCARNATION ATTACK.

00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:54.030
LET ME GUESS--
YOU WERE UP ALL NIGHT

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.496
WORKING ON THAT FANCY MOVE,

00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:56.496
WEREN’T YA?

00:15:56.496 --> 00:15:57.896
I DON’T KNOW. MAYBE.

00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:58.930
READY TO GIVE UP?

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.863
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:16:00.863 --> 00:16:02.163
YOU’RE NOT THE ONLY ONE

00:16:02.163 --> 00:16:05.130
WHO SPENT LAST NIGHT
LEARNING SOME NEW TRICKS.

00:16:07.396 --> 00:16:08.563
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

00:16:08.563 --> 00:16:10.796
THESE WINGS
REALLY ARE AMAZING.

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:13.030
THE ADVANTAGE IT GIVES YOU
IS SO INCREDIBLE,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.330
BUT I’M ACTUALLY KINDA STUNNED

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.430
AS TO WHY YOU’RE
STILL AT LEVEL FOUR.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.930
BUT YOU CAN REST ASSURED,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:20.563
I WILL MASTER THEIR POWER

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.063
AND PUT THEM
TO MUCH BETTER USE

00:16:22.063 --> 00:16:24.063
THAN YOU EVER DID.

00:16:24.063 --> 00:16:25.896
SORT OF LIKE THIS.

00:16:25.896 --> 00:16:28.930
EQUIP PYRO-DEALER.

00:16:34.763 --> 00:16:36.063
( gasps )

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.763
( grunts )

00:16:54.696 --> 00:16:56.696
( laughs )
AVIATION ABILITY

00:16:56.696 --> 00:16:58.463
AND LONG-RANGE FIREPOWER

00:16:58.463 --> 00:16:59.996
IS AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION.

00:16:59.996 --> 00:17:02.796
AND WITH THE FIELD-DESTRUCTION
BONUS I JUST GOT,

00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:05.563
I CAN RECHARGE MY
SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE.

00:17:05.563 --> 00:17:07.996
NOW I CAN GO ONE FOREVER.

00:17:07.996 --> 00:17:09.096
LET’S JUST BE HONEST.

00:17:09.096 --> 00:17:11.063
I’M UNSTOPPABLE.

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:13.196
Haru:
I WOULDN’T BE SO SURE!
HUH?

00:17:13.196 --> 00:17:15.396
IN ORDER FOR YOU
TO BE TRULY UNSTOPPABLE,

00:17:15.396 --> 00:17:17.796
THERE’S ONE CONDITION
THAT YOU’RE FORGETTING ABOUT!

00:17:17.796 --> 00:17:18.930
UH?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.630
AND THAT’S THAT?

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.030
WELL...

00:17:23.663 --> 00:17:26.663
YOU’D HAVE TO BE THE ONLY ONE
HERE WHO COULD FLY!

00:17:26.663 --> 00:17:28.730

SO THEN...

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.196
YOU WERE HIDING THAT CARD
UP YOUR SLEEVE THE WHOLE TIME.

00:18:47.196 --> 00:18:49.996
OKAY, YOU’VE GOTTA TELL ME...

00:18:49.996 --> 00:18:52.563
HOW DID YOU
GET A HOLD OF THAT TOY?

00:18:52.563 --> 00:18:54.196
DID YOU BUY IT WITH POINTS

00:18:54.196 --> 00:18:55.996
OR DID YOU STEAL IT
FROM SOMEONE LIKE--

00:18:55.996 --> 00:18:57.696
YOU WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND
IF I TOLD YOU.

00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:59.430
OH, AND WHY’S THAT?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.796
THE PERSON WHO CREATED
THESE SKY-BLUE WINGS

00:19:01.796 --> 00:19:03.096
ENTRUSTED THEM TO ME!

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:05.596
ALONG WITH HER
HOPES AND DREAMS!

00:19:05.596 --> 00:19:07.996
IT’S SOMETHING YOU
WOULD <i>NEVER</i> UNDERSTAND.

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:09.996
SOMEONE LIKE YOU ONLY
SEES THE ACCELERATED WORLD

00:19:09.996 --> 00:19:11.530
AS A MEANS TO AN END!

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.030
YOU SHOULDN’T EVEN
CALL YOURSELF A BURST LINKER!

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.730
( scoffs )
A BURST LINKER?

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.430
AND SINCE WHEN DID I
EVER CALL MYSELF THAT?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.663
WHAT?
THAT’S WHAT THE FIRST
GENERATION OF PLAYERS

00:19:22.663 --> 00:19:23.796
CALLED THEMSELVES.

00:19:23.796 --> 00:19:26.096
WE WOULD NEVER USE THAT TERM.

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:28.063
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE"?

00:19:28.063 --> 00:19:29.796
COME ON, LET’S FINISH THIS.

00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:30.930
YOU READY?

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.530
LET’S MATCH OUR INCARNATION

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.530
AGAINST ONE ANOTHER

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.530
AND SEE WHOSE DESIRE

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.796
IS THE STRONGEST.

00:19:35.796 --> 00:19:37.696
INCARNATION
ISN’T ABOUT DESIRE!

00:19:37.696 --> 00:19:39.263
IT’S ABOUT HOPE!

00:19:39.263 --> 00:19:40.763
( yelling )

00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:42.396

00:19:47.863 --> 00:19:49.663

00:19:54.563 --> 00:19:55.730
( yelps )

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.096
NO! I’M NOT DONE YET!!!

00:19:59.163 --> 00:20:00.496
( grunts )

00:20:00.496 --> 00:20:02.230
( yells )

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.296
AAH!

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:07.030
( groaning )

00:20:09.463 --> 00:20:11.863
WHAT? ARE YOU PLANNING
ON DRIVING BOTH OF US

00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:12.863
INTO THE GROUND?

00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:14.263
I’LL ACTIVATE MY DEFENSES,

00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:16.430
AND YOU’LL JUST END UP
DESTROYING YOURSELF.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.030
YEAH?! WELL GUESS AGAIN!

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.696
( gasps )
TAKU!

00:20:19.696 --> 00:20:20.830
DO IT!

00:20:23.396 --> 00:20:25.663
LIGHTNING CYAN SPIKE!

00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:26.930

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.063

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.363
HARU.

00:20:48.363 --> 00:20:49.496
THANKS, TAKU.

00:20:49.496 --> 00:20:51.063
I KEPT MY FAITH IN YOU.

00:20:51.063 --> 00:20:53.230
I KNEW YOU WERE
TAKING DAMAGE ON PURPOSE

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.263
SO THAT YOU COULD CHARGE UP
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE.

00:20:56.263 --> 00:20:57.330
EXACTLY.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.096
AND I HAD FAITH YOU
BELIEVED IN ME, TOO.

00:21:05.796 --> 00:21:07.263
Haru:
SEE THAT, NOMI?

00:21:07.263 --> 00:21:09.596
YOU DIDN’T LOSE THIS FIGHT
BECAUSE OF GALE THRUSTER

00:21:09.596 --> 00:21:11.163
OR EVEN AN INCARNATION ATTACK.

00:21:12.196 --> 00:21:14.030
YOU LOST BECAUSE WE
WEREN’T ALONE!

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.496
AND IT’S FOR THIS SAME REASON

00:21:15.496 --> 00:21:18.096
THAT YOU’LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO BEAT US IN THE FUTURE.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.330

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:28.330
UH!

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.030
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.096
AND WHERE’S IT COMING FROM?

I DON’T GET IT.

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:18.600
Haru: WHY?

00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:21.733
WHY, CHIYU?!
